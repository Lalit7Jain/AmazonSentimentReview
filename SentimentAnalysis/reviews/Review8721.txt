CAN'T PLAY MUSIC on multiple Echo's/computers,etc.  You have to setup a completely separate account for each device in order to listen to music at the same time on each device.  Every time you have a device play it will turn off any other device that is playing. Don't think you can buy multiple devices and play them at the same time in different rooms of your home.
