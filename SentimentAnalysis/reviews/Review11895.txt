I love my Echo!  I've had it for a few days now and have used it for a variety of things. The setup was easy and I did the voice training several times hoping it would help out with any misunderstandings. Alexa has a great speaker that sounds crisp & clear which is good since she replaced my old Bluetooth speaker. Alexa will tell you the time, measurements, mileage to a location.  She can set alarms & timers, play a variety of music, answer pretty much any question which you could look up online but quickly.  She can control your lights or other appliances. With certain apps she can play games and tell you account balances.  She sure does a lot and she can even tell you jokes!  She's been pretty useful these last few days and I'm really pleased with my purchase!
