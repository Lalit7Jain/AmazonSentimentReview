I love the device I was skeptical at first because of the price but it is so worth it i've seen reviews on those that have purchased the original dot who are upset with amazon because of the release of a 2nd generation just two months later after there purchase and they are prime users I find that disheartening myself but we do live in an unfair world full of selfishness and money hungry corporations so what do you expect some of the complaints are towards the dot not being able to understand you from far away but hey thats why you purchase the echo right or it would be unfair to us since we paid almost two hundred dollars sounds like someones trying to get a better device for a cheaper price
