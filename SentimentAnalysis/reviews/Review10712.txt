DO NOT BUY THIS ECHO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! IT HAS VERY SHORT LIFE. IT JUST STOPPED WORKING AFTER 6 MOS! AMAZON WON'T EVEN REPLACE IT! I HAVE BEEN TOSSED BACK AND FORTH BY CUSTOMER SERVICE ABOUT ORDERING A POWER ADAPTOR TO SUPPOSEDLY FIX IT BUT TOOK FOREVER TO ARRIVE. THE ADAPTOR LOOKS FAKE TOO AS SHOWN IN THIS PHOTO! IT STILL DOESN'T WORK! IT WON'T TURN OUT! I TRIED ALL TROUBLE SHOOTING TIPS BUT FAILED! JUST A PIECE OF JUNK! A DISPOSABLE RADIO ONLY!!! I BET THE ECHO DOT IS ALSO LIKE THAT! GRRR! I'M SO DISAPPOINTED!  I USED TO LOVE THIS ECHO BUT NOW I REALLY HATE THAT IT BROKE SO EASILY! IF I COULD GIVE NEGATIVE STARS I WOULD! VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE TOO!
