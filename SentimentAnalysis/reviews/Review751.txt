I have bought 3 echo's & one echo dot. I have one & the others were gifts.  Mine is 14 months old & quit working, it is DEAD. We used a power cord from one of the others(it's 2 months old), Still no luck.  We reported the problem with the Alexa app, they quickly called us.  After going through some test, they conceded that  they did not know what is wrong. Their solution is to send me a new one for $179! They offered an $8 discount (seriously), we said "NO", then they added an additional $10 discount, we said "NO". Then we were put on hold & they came back & offered a $50 discount, we again said "NO!" Our Alexa sits on our kitchen counter, we do not have small children, it still looks brand new, we don't use it that much-it is a novelty. WHY, would I buy another one?? I am afraid the other 2 &/or dot will also quit working. I am an Amazon Prime member & really expected better service on a 14 month Amazon electronic.
