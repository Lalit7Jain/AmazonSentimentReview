First, I would like to say that I loved this device while it worked. The one year warranty that comes with the Echo expired 2 months ago for my Echo. Funny how things work out because two months after the warranty expired, the speaker began to cut out. Then the subwoofer disconnected and the volume is now around 10%. So I called Amazon. After an excruciating 30 minutes of explaining what was happening and answering the same questions over and over again, I was told that since I was out of warranty, the best they could do is discount me $28 on a new Echo. I asked if there was any way to repair the Echo and they told me NOPE. So BUYER BEWARE. Great for the first 14 months, then the seedy side of Amazon shows its true colors. As a former loyal Amazon customer, I have to say that this whole experience has shaken my trust in the company and I plan to look elsewhere for smarthome products in the future.
