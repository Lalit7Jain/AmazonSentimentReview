We love our echo!!! We have now purchased 5 echo's for our family members. Everyone that see'S how many things you can do with this becomes jealous and wants one for themselves. We have smart light switches and an outlet plug. We plan to get the thermostat soon too. I would say we use it the most for turning on and off lights every morning and evening or when leaving the house with hands so full it's a talent, and also all the music! Just ask her to play a song that's stuck in your head and she will do it!! You can repeat, pause, skip.. you can ask her questions, what the temperature is outside or when your favorite basketball team is playing next so
