I love the Echo. The app was glitchy at first with the iPhone 7 Plus and luckily, I didn't have to find out how to setup again through the app as it resolved itself. The only downfall and/or my complaint is that I wish it would be able to sync to my Bluetooth system and play also from the Echo so I can play music throughout the entire house. I love the smarthome features as well as they are easy to setup.
