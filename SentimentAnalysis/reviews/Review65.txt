Since we've returned the Google device, I have purchased two more Echos.  We now have one on each nightstand in our home and another in the kitchen.  We have grown so accustomed to accessing weather, news, and music; setting timers, alarms, and calendar appointments; and controlling our home's smart devices just by speaking that I actually feel a bit lost when I travel on business.
