I received the echo as a gift.  I love it!  I use it most when entertaining. Since everyone has their favorite genre, we can switch the music very easily. People love to "play" with it.  Usually finding old music and adjusting the volume while we have game night.  It is great for making lists, weather and news updates, as well as reminders.
