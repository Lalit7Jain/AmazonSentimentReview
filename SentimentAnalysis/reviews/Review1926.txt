Fast shipping! Still growing on me because I am still learning but not as advanced as I thought...I have it hooked up with my WiFi and when I ask questions that "OK Google" would answer back Echo doesn't know them and states quite often that she doesn't understand what I am requesting or doesn't understand the question....Kinda disappointing with this day and ages technological advances.
