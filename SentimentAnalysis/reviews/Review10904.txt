She is wonderful, but she comes up short in a couple of areas. Sometimes I'll ask for a fun fact from Fun Facts and she'll have one but I don't catch all of it. I'll ask her to repeat the fun fact and she doesn't understand the question she heard. She should be able to understand repeat. Also, she doesn't understand if I ask her to open Random Fact instead of Random Facts.  Some of the skills are really lame and should have been checked by Amazon.
