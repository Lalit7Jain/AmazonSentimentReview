I love this thing.  I use it for home automation by integrating it with Home Control Assistant software and my Honeywell Total Comfort thermostats.  I can walk in a room and say "Alexa, Turn on the bedroom lamp" and I feel like I'm in a Star Trek scene when the light comes on.  I can also say things like, "Alexa, Set thermostat to 74."  My only complaint is that I cannot change the key word from "Alexa" to "Computer".
