Then came the day Alexa arrived. I set it up, started talking to her...and I ended up talking to her and testing it for a couple hours. I COULD NOT STOP. I LOVE listening to music and podcasts and I typically just do it on my phone when I am getting ready in the morning or cleaning. Now all I have to do is tell Alexa to play whatever song, playlist, etc my heart desires! The speakers are loud and awesome. So I have used her mostly for music at this point. We have a weekly gathering with friends and they were excited that they could each have a turn in playing whatever song they want rather then just playing Pandora with random songs or typing in each song on the YouTube app on our Xbox One. We just say "Alexa, Play this song." and she plays it. The only negative thing that I have noticed, is that when the music is playing/loud, she has issues hearing you say ALEXA during the song if you want to change something. We had to walk over to it and scream at her sometimes. For Prime Members you do have to pay an extra $3.99 per month to enable the unlimited music thing. You get a 30 day free trial when you enable it. Alexa will play Pandora and use Amazon Music. BUT to request specific songs and to use the lyrics finder, you have to pay extra. I think it is worth it because I mainly use it to play music anyway.
