Wow.  We love alexa, she does so many things for us.  Grocery list.  Dr  Appointments.  Scheduled events daily.  Calorie counter.  Timer for cooking.  So many things it can do.  We have and IPhone and have these apps on our phones.  She feels in our blanks.  Also reminds you t take certain meds.  We will find a lot more uses the longer we have this.
