I am extremely disappointed with the Amazon Echo.  I understand that electronic devices do not last forever, but in two years my Echo has stopped working.  I take care of it and other than a defect, it should not just stop working.  This makes me question the quality of Amazon products.  A product that costs so much and displays your the Amazon name should be of a better quality.  A $20 consolation and a "there is nothing we can do" is very disappointing.  I recommend that all customers think twice before purchasing.
