I have to fight with it for 20 mins just to play Hosley radio. It seems to find EVERYTHING that sounds like Hosley.. but not what I wanted. I ask it simple questions just like the google commercial... nothing. I just get "I'm sorry I dont understand what you are asking." Sure its a great looking and sounding device but it is lacking the brains. This was a nice attempt by Amazon but it's not Google. I want to throw it out the window. About the only thing it is good for is turning on the lights. Its a shame because I had high hopes for this device.
