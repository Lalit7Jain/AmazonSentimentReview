Great device, still has a lot of potential.  I will update this to a 5 Star if Amazon goes above and beyond with Alexa.  I really wish I could rely on the echo for more things that my phone has standard.  Connecting my calendars to Alexa and having her remind me throughout the day would be incredible.
