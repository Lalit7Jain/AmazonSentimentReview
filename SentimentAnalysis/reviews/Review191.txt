I cannot tell you how much fun this is......we are always thinking up things to ask her.  She has taken the place of my dictionary.  Each morning when I say "Echo Good Morning" (Yes you have a choice of 3 names) she tells me something different.  Opening Day she sang a very good rendition of Take Me Out to The Ball Game.  I love playing Word Master with her. She reads my kindle books.  Keeps my shopping list...orders for me...My To Do List......which never seems to get done.  I Love Echo.....Oh, and she plays my Playlists that I have on Amazon and lots of music from Prime.
