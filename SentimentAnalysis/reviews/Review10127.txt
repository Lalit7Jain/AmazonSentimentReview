I love Alexa my only issue is I can't remember what each launch fraize to use for what skill.....how is this resolved....I have stop and look on the app.....kinda defeats the purpose....????  Maybe in the future she will be more adaptable to questions kinda like google is.....  I have to say I do plan on purchasing the Dot to put in my bedroom.  There has been so many times this past year I wanted to add to my shopping list or to do list or play this etc... and  I found myself say Alexa...but she is in the living room and can't hear me....LOL
