Bought this over the holidays when it was on sale and had to wait until after Christmas for delivery due to high demand. I just finished setting this up after it arrived in the mail. So far, so good. I had a bit of an issue with the app on my phone but I'm not sure if that was a problem with my WiFi or the app itself. In any event, got it set up and immediately started playing music! Not the absolute highest quality speaker for music but it gets the job done. Louder than I thought it would be! I'll see how this works out int eh long term but for now I'm happy with my purchase.
