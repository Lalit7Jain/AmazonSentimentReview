The main reason I wanted to buy the echo is Alexa herself. I wanted to see if she really was a step up from Siri or Cortana. And I am very pleased! She is more than just a functional program, she has a funny and nice personality with answers for a lot of random questions/commands. My favorites so far are "Alexa, tell me a story" and "Alexa, do you have children?"
