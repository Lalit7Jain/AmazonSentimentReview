I bought this for my parents but was a little worried about their lack of technological knowledge. After the set up( which I did and was the easiest set up ever) I began to fall in love. As did my parents. My father talks to her like shes the new hit woman on the block. Alexa is nothing like Siri, she is strong and listens to what you are saying, I know longer have to sit and yell into my phone because I now have someone that understands me, Alexa. I have amazon unlimited and Alexa plays me the best music, anything I ever want, and she knows exactly what I like. Best product, I mean family member I have ever..purchased. We love her.
