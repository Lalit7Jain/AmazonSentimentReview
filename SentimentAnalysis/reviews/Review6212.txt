If you ask her easy questions she will get them every time. But I haven't had much luck getting her to search the internet for information. The ads also are a little misleading about asking her to play a song. She will only play a specific song if its old enough to be on prime music for free or if you had paid for a music subscription. She will play stations from pandora, but that doesn't guarantee a certain song. Also.... if she is on volume 10, then you have to get really close to get her to hear you to turn her down.
