I bought the Echo as a Christmas gift. So the rating reflects that "we" and Alexa are learning how to live with each other. Part of this is that we  assumed that asking a question to Alexa is more like googling....which she isn't. So this is a very early report....I am reading all the emails etc on how to work with Alexa...and that is very helpful. We do like the joke of the day.  One of our neighbors has an Echo so we get tips from them as well. I'm sure that our rating will go up as we get better...but there is a learning curve.
