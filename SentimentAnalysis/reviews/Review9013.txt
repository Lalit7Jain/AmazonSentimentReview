So far so good....been using for about a month and although it can't do everything it is fun to use and easy to setup. Just wish it would pair to an external Bluetooth speaker. Sound is very good for its size and the voice recognition is fairly good as well. My TV sometimes interferes with communication but that's not a big issue. Have installed (turned on) several skills and they seem to function good as well.
