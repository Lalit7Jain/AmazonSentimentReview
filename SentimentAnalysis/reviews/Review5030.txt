Purchased two as gifts. One with for a family with two 8yrs olds and one for a semi-retired grandmother. Rave reviews from both camps. The kids are learning new tricks, "knock knock" jokes are the new favorite. Dance parties are also on tap for the every present breakout moments. Grandma and mom and dad get the weather. All listen to tunes, ask questions, etc. Both parties are a little leery of ordering products. Reading a review or two, checking prices and seeing the order go thru versus just saying it seems to be the preferred option right now. Great gifts...
