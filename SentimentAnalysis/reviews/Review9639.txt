So we are trying out Amazon Echo this morning, giving it all commands and seeing what works or not. So far we are okay with it. Though we noticed if you happen to test the volume to the loudest, Alexa will not hear you..so got to manually tone it down.  I do wish it has Family Feud..so far it has Jeopardy skill.  We were testing its interface with TrackR device, it seems, it can only track one trackR device at a time. Maybe it is the limitation of TrackR and not of Amazon Echo. But it does work, it will ring your phone when you ask Alexa to track it.  We were testing music apps, at times, after it plays your music of choice, it will play whatever music afterwards that we did not choose, maybe we still have to understand configuration better.
