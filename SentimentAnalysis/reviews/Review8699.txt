This is a good little item but Alexa seems to have a lot of problems getting answers----i.e, what ingredients are on a rueben sandwich----what is the height of an average 3 year old girl.  Only got this recently and for the most part it is good...love  the music... love the weather report..... but either us or Alexa needs to do better on answers-or how we ask the question?
