I have hooked this to my smartthings hub and it works great. We turn our house lights on and off when our hands are full and my 5 year old loves talking to Alexa! She plays him music and tells bedtime stories... he just loves her! Linked to pandora as well. Planning on extending network and getting a dot for the bedroom. I even followed online posts and linked her to google!
