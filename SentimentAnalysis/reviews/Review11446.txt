This has been a purchase worth buying! I am someone that doesn't like to buy something and found out I wasted my money....but I know I didn't here. Sure it is not the cheapest but for the price you can't go wrong. I have spent just as much on Bluetooth speakers that don't do as much as the ECHO! One of my favorite things about ECHO is that it is an item that is always learning new things. So you won't be stuck with an item that stuck going nowhere. She always has some new surprises for you! Believe me, though our relationship has our ups and downs just like anyone you  can have a conversation with. There are some things I think she should be able to answer but she can't.
