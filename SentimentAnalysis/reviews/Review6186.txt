The speaker on the refurbished Echo sounds as if it is blown.  It has a fuzzy, static sound.  The Echos my friends and family have do not sound like mine, their Echos are clear and sharp.  Also, anyone that purchases an Echo should be advised that they must have Amazon Prime to get the best free music.  The minute I canceled my Prime membership, I could not receive any music stations from the Echo.
