This product has proven to be unbelievably disappointing. At first, the Echo was interesting and a useful home tool. However, after the first few weeks, my wife and I found ourselves really wondering what use their could be for Alexa, besides creating lists, listening to the radio/news, and playing the occasional game of Jeopardy (all things that could be easily done on a smart phone or a computer, but were still cool to do on this new toy). So, that was when we really began diving into trying out the skills that the Alexa app had to offer, but most of them still leave something to be desired.
