Even though I wish I could run around with her without plugging her in, I would still choose her over the other two options, because of her speaker size and her hands-free capability. After all that is why I bought her....Since I am a prime member I do listen to Amazon music as well, when I am in the mood she finds what I need. Sometimes I do have to tell her a few times to get it right, but only on music that isn't that easy to find anyways. My friends and family are in awe over her and quite simply " I am in love with the girl!"
