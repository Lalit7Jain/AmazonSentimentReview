I've had her for almost a year now. She's a decent speaker. I was excited when I got her I looked forward to many improvements... I still hope they release a better model with all of the improvements suggested via here and reddit. She doesn't hear as well as she once did. I pretty much wish she was my android phone lol. That woukd fix all of her flaws hahaha.
