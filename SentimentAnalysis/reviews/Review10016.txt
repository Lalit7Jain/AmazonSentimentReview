Love Amazon Echo!  This little tower can really do so many things.  I personally love being able to turn on and off the lights with just a simple command.  My only complaint is I ordered the gift wrap as it was a gift for my husband and it was stuffed into a skin tight bag that I could not seal.  Very disappointed I spent money on wrapping it when in the end I had to wrap it myself to keep it a surprise.
