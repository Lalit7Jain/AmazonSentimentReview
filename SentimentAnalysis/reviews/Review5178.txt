Honestly it is pretty cool at times when it is working, 9 times out of 10 it will tell you "Sorry I can't give you an answer to the question." or it brings up something completely unrelated. Google home is definitely a better product, it was as simple as asking. What does a whale sound like? Google home gives you a whale call, Amazon Echo says "Splash."
