It's a bit difficult to use - i.e. I can't say "do this" I have to remember to say "ask (name of the app installed) to (do exactly this task)". So, that's annoying. Plays music well, sounds nice, good for news, good for music, good for starting my car, but overhyped. Siri + a Bluetooth speaker is comparable, the rest of the features are not really there yet.
