I purchased the Echo as a Christmas 2015 present to myself.  Over the last year, I have used it everyday, and I have decided I would not want to live without it.  I love it!!  I can listen to any genre of music, even creating my own playlists.  She tells me the latest news, weather, jokes, trivia, and movies.  She is a timer, a stopwatch, an exercise coach, game host, and more.
