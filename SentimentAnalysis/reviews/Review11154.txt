well it doesn't do exactly what I thought it would do. I mainly wanted it for of course music, but it doesn't recognize some of the most popular songs I like, and IT DOES NOT DO TRAFFIC, there is no app, and was told that I would have to have a radio station app for that and I wanted it exclusively for that since I want to know where the delays are etc., so this is really of no use to me and I have to download other apps for recipes etc., just too time consuming, so it's going back until they can fix it....also I've had to yell at it in order for it to hear me....and then it didn't give me a wake up call, so I was glad I still use my phone and an extra alarm, to me it's just not worth it right now, until they actually get it completely right
