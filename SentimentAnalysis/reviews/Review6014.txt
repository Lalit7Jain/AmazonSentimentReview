Alexa is different from Siri on a phone because she's confined to your home; you don't have to deal with strangers when using her and might not have your phone in your pocket everywhere you go in your house. Being able to talk to something stationary that's not tied to your smartphone actually does make some things easier at home. It's not just about being able to turn off your smart light bulbs by asking Alexa to do it for you—Alexa kind of becomes a life assistant when used to her fullest potential.
