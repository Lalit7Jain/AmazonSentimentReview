When I purchased the refurbished Echo, it was not stated anywhere that the power adapter was not included. In fact, under the "what's in the box" section it says that it includes the power cable. Alas, when I opened the box it says to "plug in the power adapter (not included)' as part of the instruction. Needless to say, I am disappointed and will be sending this back immediately.
