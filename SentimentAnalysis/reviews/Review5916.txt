My ECHO was a Christmas Present, that I got for Myself. I was excited to see, what this Personal Assistant, ALEXA, could do to make My life better & more fun. First, I looked for a Guide Book, or, at least a good Quick Start Guide in the nice box. Only, a  tiny, 3"x3" folder, with print, so small that a magnifier is needed to read it? Seems, it is necessary to purchased a Guide Book, for another $10 is needed? Set-up was difficult, linking it to My WiFi was confusing, and the Voice Training had to be repeated several times. I understand, that this is a new use of Artificial Intelligence in the Smart Home, but for the money, in My opinion, it just isn't worth the trouble. Knowing that, AMAZON is always easy to work with, I'm returning this ECHO. I'll wait for a updated one to become available. Thanks!
