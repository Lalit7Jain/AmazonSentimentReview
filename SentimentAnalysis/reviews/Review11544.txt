Someone once said that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic and boy were they right.  My mom can say to me "I would like to read XZY book".  I go to my Audible account, buy the book and 1 minute later she is listening to it on the Echo.  To her, this truly is magic!!  I have never seen ads pointing out the virtues of this device for people with vision or mobility problems which is what prompted me to write this review.  For my parents, this little thing has really improved their lives considerably.
