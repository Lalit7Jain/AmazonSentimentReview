The center of my smart home has worked flawlessly so far.  The speakers leave alot to be desired though as they lack any sort of punch when the volume is turned up.  Even with this, I have 2 Google Home devices on order as much definitely looking for something more.  I'M betting that GH will narrow Amazons lead in short order.
