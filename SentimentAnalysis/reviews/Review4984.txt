I received this as a Christmas gift. My home is not automated, I am able to turn on light switches and set the thermostat with my hands. So, how do I use it? Primarily for music. I have several thousand tracks in my personal library. With Basic Prime, 250 are loaded. It plays well, I can hear the music any where in the house, better than my sound system, which is more powerful but directional. My only complaint is that it says it is shuffling the music but it always plays the same tracks. Haven't been able to get it to play sequentially.
