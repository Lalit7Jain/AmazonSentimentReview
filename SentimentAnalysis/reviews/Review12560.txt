Overall, I'm disappointed. Although the unit does a good job of voice recognition and listening through background noise, it simply can't answer the most simple questions. Based on my experience, Alexa is capable of answering about 15% of your requests. Ask it NFL team records or any simple search items and she will gladly tell you that she simply doesn't know.  I've become tired of Alexa telling me the things she can't do.  Get used to hearing "sorry,  I don't have the answer to that question"
