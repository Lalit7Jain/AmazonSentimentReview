I like it - but actually about the only thing I use it for is a speaker.  I could have bought something else much cheaper to be a speaker, but that's an issue with me and not the Echo.  Product works great, no doubt about that.  Will keep you occupied conversing with her but after awhile it just became a novelty.  Now I dust it off every so often and introduce it to my friends who come in my office.
