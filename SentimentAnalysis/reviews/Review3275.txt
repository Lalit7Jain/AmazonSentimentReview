I love this thing and now my husband (whom was a skeptic) is in love as well.  It is so nice to just ask for music -anything and here it right away.  I use the alarm and timer settings all the time.  I was surprised how easy it was to aske for a Thai Restaurant and it gave the top 3 in my area and then sent directions and reviews to my phone.  Really one of my favorite purchases.
