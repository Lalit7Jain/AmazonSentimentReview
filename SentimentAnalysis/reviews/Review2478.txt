oh my goodness where do i start?? i absolutely love this thing. i say Alexa good morning and she tells me what significant thing has happened or is happening on this date, i play songs that i haven't heard for years, i know the traffic situation to my work, i know the weather for travel or for fishing.....wow i love this!!!! i feel like I'm in quantum leap hahahah . she can toss a coin, tell jokes, I called my family in UK they are getting one, I talk about it in work they are getting one they said i ought to be a sponsor for this because i can't say enough great things about it, the set up was so easy too. i tell her to place items on my shopping list then in a second its on my phone, I tell her to place something on my to do list and its there in a second on my phone!!! I'm stuck on a crossword puzzle she helps !! kids home work....yep! I need help there too haha. there is no end to her possibilities. I don't currently have any smart switches so I can't comment on those but I wouldn't want to be without my echo
