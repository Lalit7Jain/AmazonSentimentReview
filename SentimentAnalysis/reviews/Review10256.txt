Love the shopping list and ease of use of my Philip Hue lights using Alexa.. You have to train Alexa but she is also training you.  I love the neat shopping list that she produces form my voice commands to her, I then open the Alexa app in the grocery store and never forget an item.  I can tell Alexa to play anything in my prime including favorite artist and she will shuffle the hits.  I can say Alexa play upbeat R&B and she will play songs I have not thought about in a while.  Was so impressed with her my husband wanted a dot for the upstairs.  I can reorder thru amazon with no fuss and place new orders you have to work a little at this one but it does work.  Well worth the money.
