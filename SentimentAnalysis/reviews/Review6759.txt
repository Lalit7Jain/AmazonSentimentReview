Great item. The speaker could use a little tweaking but it's not really made for the speaker. It's a great item to have in the house to ask questions and get the weather and all kinds of other things. The best part is it can make things so much easier as in connecting with Hue light bulbs and other devices to help out around the house. Sometimes it don't understand me very well but it's getting better all the time. It seems to learn your speech and gets better over time.
