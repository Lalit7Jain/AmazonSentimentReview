Love this thing.  Had a few glitches trying to set it up but there are YouTube videos out there that helped and with a little struggle I got it up and running.  I use it mainly for simple things such as listening to radio, streaming music, telling time, and weather but you get addicted to having it for those things. As an aside the selection on Prime music is surprisingly good.
