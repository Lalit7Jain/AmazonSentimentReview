Thought I loved this, then I heard an unwelcome advertisement for another Amazon product, the "Echo Dot", are you f*ing kidding me?  If the product (Amazon Echo), for which I paid, which is connected to my Spotify Premium (for which I pay monthly) and my Amazon Prime (for which I pay annually), then why the hell are you interrupting my listening experience and serving up an ad for "Echo Dot."  Do you think people won't notice?
