Want to love it overall, but as a speaker it's pretty tinny and flat. Needs richer, fuller sound. Adequate for soft background music, but not going to crank the tunes with it. Otherwise, Echo is amazing. Can tell it will become a way of life for me. I'm sure future versions will keep improving. Great first product. Amazon is incredibly progressive.
