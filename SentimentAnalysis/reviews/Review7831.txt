this is another edit of Alexis...just want to let all of you know that Alexis will answer to another name...lol... it is funny...when you say the name of Alexis to wake her up...instead choose the name Elixir...lol...she will wake up to that name as well...why? because it sounds as if you are saying Alexis...try to say Elixir as you would say Alexis..as you can tell by saying them both they sound the same...I wake her up with both names now and since I know she has a first name as well I will use it also...go ahead give it a try see what you think...have fun with it...
