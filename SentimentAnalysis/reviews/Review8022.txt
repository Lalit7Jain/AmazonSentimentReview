Love the Dot! Alexa is way better on the Echo then the Firestick! Truly a welcome addition to the home and home automation. I am an Apple User, interacts with Siri, But Alexa, on the Echo, by far is way better. I have to admit, Amazon did there homework and has established themselves as a top contender in the home Automation Segment!
