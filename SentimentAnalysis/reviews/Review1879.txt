I loved it when I got it, but it has proven to be a big disappointment!  It's not the "physical" item, so much as it is obviously the individuals who are "programming" it.  The server is very undependable;  Alexa will start "talking" without the wake word;  music streaming is "iffy" at best;  and its ability to interact with smart plugs, skills, etc. is very sporadic.  I know Amazon is really pushing its capability to order merchandise using Alexa, but I strongly recommend against it -- it might never arrive, or you could end up with three of everything. It may work perfectly for the guy on TV who orders it to "turn on the sprinklers" but that, like so many other TV commercials, is pure fantasy!  Definitely not something you can depend on.
