Another serious problem, and one preventing my from purchasing other Amazon Alexa products, is the inability to use my various Echos to control my Fire TV Stick. I appreciate that the new versions come with an Alexa enabled remote, but i don't want to sit on my sofa in the same room as my Echo and have to use another device to access my Fire TV Stick. That to me seems like a serious design flaw. Why have 2 Alexa devices in the same room when, if they all access the same cloud, can't i just tell my Echo to play an Amazon Prime movie on my TV Stick?
