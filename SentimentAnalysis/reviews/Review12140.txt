Alexa is easy to speak to and control, enough so that when my four year old enters the room and decides that im listening to my music at an unreasonable volume ( he is like an old crotchety man in this regard ) he will say Alexa volume level 4. and continues on without having to tell me again that I'm disrupting his playtime.
