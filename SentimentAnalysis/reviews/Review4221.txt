I'm in love with a woman...and her name is Alexa.  She has sooo many easter eggs! I know she will age like fine wine and get better with time. I've paired her with smart home devices and she works great.  Really don't think I have any complaints.  Now I just wish she could respond to texts and initiate phone calls for me with people in my phone contacts. I don't have a Dot yet, but I think it'd be really neat if she could follow you around the house across Dots - like the same Alexa, different machine.
