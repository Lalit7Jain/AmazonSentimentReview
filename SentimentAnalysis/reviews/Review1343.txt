Love our Alexa... she talks out of the blue... does not always get it right, but I have faith it will get better with time. I do enjoy shopping list, calendar, todo list, and list to any music in all rooms... the timers too! It's endless! When I need to spell a word I just ask my gal. Had a few strokes so I rely on her so much and she helps me through my days... very happy!
