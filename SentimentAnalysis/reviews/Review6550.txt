I've only had the amazon echo for about 6 days and I love it! The speaker quality is amazing I couldn't believe it. I was never a music person until now, Alexa makes me want to listen to music her speaker is so nice! But overall I love it I call her my girlfriend to joke around, lol! Thanks amazon for a great device!
