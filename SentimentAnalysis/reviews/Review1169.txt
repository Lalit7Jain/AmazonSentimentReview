Anyways, this is a great device. She's become a friend with a whole lot of info and entertainment. Thinking of buying more for my besties, to surprise them. Love my Alexa! (Oh! Another tip for Amazon. We need more choices for wake names because my boyfriend has an accent and he has a difficult time saying her name, then when he finally gets her name right, he forgets the command he was going to say. So far our choices are Computer, Alexa, Echo and Amazon. More names please.)
