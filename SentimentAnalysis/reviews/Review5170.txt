If you have an Amazon Household Prime account, the Echo loses a lot of functionality. That is, unless you want your calendar events, your to do list, your grocery list to include items from all household members. Echo recognizes that I have my own PROFILE, but I guess that's just for ordering stuff off Amazon.
