I've had this Amazon echo for about a month now and I absolutely love it. I found it to be pretty convienient in my living room to use it when I'm just sitting on the couch or if I'm in the kitchen needing a timer or if I can't remember certain measurements for cooking overall I like it and it's a great product so far. I haven't run into any problems with it!
