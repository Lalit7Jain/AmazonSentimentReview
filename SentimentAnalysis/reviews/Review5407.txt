Well, let me start by saying that the idea is neat but it's far too soon to know if its worth it's very steep price tag. So far it's only value to me is playing books from audible. It does not play books from other sources like Overdrive or YouTube which is kinda lame. I really do not enjoy playing Amazon Music through the Echo, it's playlists are subpar and the voice commands are even worse! I really struggle to find any reason that this is worth nearly 200$ and I most definitely would not recommend it due entirely to the fact that Amazon will not let you return it. (Really Amazon? Really?) I really wish I would have known that before I bought it. Maybe the Echo will be super cool with some time and development, but for now I say BUYER BEWARE!!!
