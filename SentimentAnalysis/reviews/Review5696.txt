its a gimmick. don't fall for it unless of course you want to pay almost $80 for 3 light bulbs so that you can talk to " Alexa" to turn them on and off. You can get lights that turn on and off with claps for a much more reasonable price. Recently there was a story on ABC news about a 4 years old girl who talked to Alexa about her wish to get a doll house and a bunch of cookies. These items were promptly delivered by Amazon! Cute but don't you think it should be a parent to decide whether they can afford their daughter's wish. If this is not a gimmick or even a scam, what is?
