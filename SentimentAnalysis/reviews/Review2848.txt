Alexa is a new member of the family and knows all! We are happy with having this around. The voice timers and daily alarms are something that seamlessly makes life easier. When we are cooking, just getting to tell Alexa to set timers instead of stopping and setting them is very efficient. She plays music very well and the speaker is very nice but I just enjoy music and am not a audiophile. I like the feature where you can ask her what the song playing is. We listen to our Amazon Prime music on Alexa and looked up Prime Playlists and keep track of which ones we like on our phones.
