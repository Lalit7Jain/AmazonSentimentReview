I have a $180 Brick.  No support from Amazon.  I also have one of their smaller units called an Echo dote which has the "blue ring of death."  The problem around this device is that there is basically no support or service.  I have three that work well and I have three that will not work at all regardless of what I do.  My suggestion is to avoid this at all costs until Amazon provides support for these devices, which they do not.
