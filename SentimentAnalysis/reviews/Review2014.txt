Bought this for my husband for Christmas. We use it mostly for music, setting timers, and keeping a shared online shopping list. The kids love playing their favorite songs with a voice command. Has a great speaker that we use for our primary music listening in the open family spaces.  You can play generic radio stations, or link it to your paid services.  But if you request something licensed - like Moana songs - you will only get samples.
