I had echo for 4 months, mainly have been putting up with it. It doesn't understand me well, I may have an accent but I teach at a large university without a problem. So I have been mainly use the app to connect to Spotify, but whenever I return to Alexia, it will disconnect from wifi and I have to restart the app. I don't understand where are all the positive feedback from, highly overrated product by Amazon!
