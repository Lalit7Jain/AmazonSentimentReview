As for the product, now that it is working. I think the sound quality of the speaker is pretty good (I have used it primarily for playing music in the first few days). I am sure that I will find additional uses for it, and I do like that you can ask for a news briefing and get NPR updates periodically. There's really no chance I will use it for things like getting rides from Uber or ordering crappy pizza from a fast-food pizza chain, but I will definitely get use out of the device for playing music, getting news, timers, alarms and smart home voice commands. It has been hit and miss with Alexa understanding my requests, but so far I have had enough success that I like the device. For example: "Play Blue by Eiffel 65" was understood perfectly, and the song came right on (from Amazon Prime Music). But, I was not able to identify the album from which Loreena Mckennitt's song "snow" was played. In short, it looks like the orders to play songs are well understood, but questions about the availability of music are not so productive. It is somewhat irritating that the Echo will play a sample of a song that is not available and then ask if you want to buy it, rather than just saying that it is not available.
