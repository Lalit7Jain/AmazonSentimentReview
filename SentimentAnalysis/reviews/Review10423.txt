I can't say enough about Alexa.  This is the greatest gift I've ever gotten.  Extremely useful in everyday activities and controlling lights, appliances, and other technology.  I have bought 2 more for my daughters.  They work great and voice recognition has been spot on for us.  I love adding things to my shopping list as I think of them and then just looking on my phone and never forgetting items any longer.  I have prime and love just asking for whatever music I want at any given moment.  We currently use smart plugs and hues lights with it and have had zero issues with them working.  It's so easy to have Alexa do whatever and whenever you need it.  Just buy it!!!
