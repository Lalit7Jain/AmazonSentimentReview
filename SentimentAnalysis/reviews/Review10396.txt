Just started to use it yesterday.  Love it!  Absolutely love it.  Wonderful clear and crisp sound with decent fabricated bass.  A must have.  Just in the one afternoon of use, of course any music I wanted was there, I asked about weather as well and jokes.  The capability is so much bigger than what I'm using right now.
