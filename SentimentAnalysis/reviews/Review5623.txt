By far my Favorite thing ever....  I love alexa... I was making dinner last night and had to set a timer and asked Alexa to do it for me...  no more stumbling for your phone to try and set a timer for food in the kitchen..  I set an alarm from bed..  I have the dots in every room now as well as the Wemo plugs .... we are planning to go out this week and get the nest... :)
