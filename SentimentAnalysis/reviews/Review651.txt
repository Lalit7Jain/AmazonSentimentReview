I have a 2014 Echo that has recently gradually been losing voice command ability.  Intermittent and getting worse. Varies from no response to random responses to a command.  Today, while it was playing, it would not respond at all - I even put my face up to it and yelled "Alexa" several times - no response.  I had to use a button to stop it.  While on the phone with tech support - I said "Alexa", it turned on and right back off, I could not give it a command.  I won't go on.
