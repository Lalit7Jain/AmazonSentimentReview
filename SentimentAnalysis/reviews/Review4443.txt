Meets expectations. Very impressed with effort put into the audio (audio aficionados will want more but it's a good little tube). The AI is on par with Siri; not perfect but useful. I've enjoyed it (it was a gift) and I had low expectations. Kudos to Amazon. It's an impressive product and I hope it evolves into much more.
