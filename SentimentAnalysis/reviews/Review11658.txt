I love Alexa. I sometimes just talk to her just to hold a conversation. Because of Alexa I also purchased wink automated home system as well as smart led lights. Alexa pairs effortlessly with wink allowing me to have full voice control of every light in my house. I also plan to fully automate everything else starting with the thermostat. NFL and NBA are back! And Alexa gives me full updates and scores. With the addition of Amazon music, Alexa can play songs effortlessly. I can say a song and she plays it just like that, I probably use this function the most since Prime Music started. Her speakers are amazing, like a full stereo speaker.
