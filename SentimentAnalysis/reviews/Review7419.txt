My fiancées father is paralyzed from the neck down. He has a computer with voice activated software that enables him to live on his own, but every week or so his computer crashes. When his computer crashes, he used to have no ability to even let anyone know his computer was off. Sometimes it would be hours before anyone figured it out.
