I read a comparison between Amazon’s IP-connected, AI-assisted Echo speaker and Google’s whatever copycat thing they call it. The review said that the luminescence ring on the top of Echo was off-putting to some people when the multi-directional microphones hear the wake word “Alexa”, and the ring lights up and snaps to attention focused towards the direction of your voice. I find that delightful as it reminds me of my beloved childhood dog  Jodie snapping to attention when I uttered our “wake word”; “Wanna go for a walk ?”
