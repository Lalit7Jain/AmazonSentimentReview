Before you buy, click on the words "Jump to:  Key Features." I didn't do this. My bad (I was caught up in the hype of advertisements as well as friends loving Echo). When you get to this key features page, skip the pictures -- they get in the way and take up too much room -- and read what Echo can do, including clicking on yet another link called Discover and Enable Skills. I was unaware of "skills."  What are they?  They are the what a user has to teach Echo because Echo doesn't know much on its own.
