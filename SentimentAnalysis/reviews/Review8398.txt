Downfalls: You're most likely buying the Echo online so do yourself a favor by shopping for smart home products online too. Every single brand seen in store requires a hub (~$99) which irritates me because the average consumer believes decent quality if large retailers promoting. TP-LINK is the only product used with my Echo and has been functioning flawlessly without a hub. Set-up was a breeze. Secondly because I'm female it has difficulty hearing my voice. Especially when music played above volume 6 it may interfere with your jam sessions. My boyfriend could whisper at all times and it will recognize him. Lastly, the price was ~20.00 cheaper than Amazon because QVC had a deal. With tax and shipping/handling it equaled out to be the same cost.  Now I'm finding them for 139.99 on Amazon Prime Shop around because I probably could have saved even more but didn't think I was going to pay off the remaining EZ pay balance so quickly either. Happy shopping!
