Who doesn't love Alexa.  There is so many things you can do with Alexa.  We are a big Alexa family.  This one I picked up for my son. With Alexa you can listen to music,play games, get the news, weather, sports updates.  Alexa would even entertain you with some jokes, okay her jokes are no that good but she's learning. Now Alexa can even turn your lights on and off with special light bulbs. I think every house needs an Alexa.  She has a stylish white body.  The music plays nice and clear.  You can control the volume level.  You can't go wrong with Alexa.
