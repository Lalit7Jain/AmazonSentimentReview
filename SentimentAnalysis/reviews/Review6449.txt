Great looking ! Easy to operate after simple connection to IPad app. . Sound quality rated at 8 out of ten being  highest . My biggest negative was with answered streaming current info as to local weather in my town and then other weather in other states . Shocked at reports of zero degree weather at my home when it was actually 21 degrees and forecasts were also way off . This made me think only of legal actions that could arise from such false reports . Love Jeff B . and Amazon so be ware . New British study compared this unit with Googles new unit and on 10 questions asked Google unit beat out my unit 8.5 to 6 answered correct out of 10 random questions . I love the music use of it and know Jeff B. et al will fix this question streaming problem very soon .
