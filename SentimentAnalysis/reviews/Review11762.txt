This isn't a fully tested product yet, however amazon does not feel any obligation to discount it any way or offer any money back even though they know it has issues. Known Issue #1, when you have multiple echoes or echo dots and send a command, they all respond with the same information within a second of each other as if the other echo product in the home doesn't exist. This is happening yet Amazon is selling these echo dots in 6-packs implying you could put them all over your home.  Amazon's answer is to use one of 3 wake up words. Well what if you have a 6 bedroom house and have an echo dot in each location? Now you have to remember what each is called in each room in order to get it to work? Super clunky.  Known Issue #2 is Voice training. Voice training is used to better recognize where the person is in relation to the echo or echo dot so you don't have to change the wake up word. That's all great an all, except if doesn't work. Amazon tech support says they are aware of both but (a) are not offering any compensation for selling a product with flaws or (b) have a date for resolution of either issue. Feeling duped for sure.
