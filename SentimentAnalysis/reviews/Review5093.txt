We are having fun getting to know Alexa and all the things she can do. I love being able to ask her to play a song or a mix of music. My kids love playing the guess the animal game, and playing jeopardy. Still learning all she can do. She gives the temperature in Celsius and I can figure out how to change it to Fahrenheit.
