I love my new Amazon Echo, is the best thing ever, i mean its so amazing how you can be in the kitchen and have the echo in the other side of the room, and just by saying "Alexa, Play Music" or anything that i need her to do like "Turn on the Kitchen Light" Or "Turn on the Living Room Tv" It just makes it happen, its so amazing having it around the house, and being able to talk to it, and even playing games with her by installing some of its Skills. Its the best thing ever, i just love it, and i hope i can buy at some point later the Portable Batter to use it on a Trip by connecting it to my Personal Hotspot, and using it on the road, it will be just totally amazing. Thanks Amazon for this Amazing Invention!
