Downloaded the Alexa app on  my tablet but after many, many hours of trying to connect to the internet. It just does not work. I will probably make a planter out of it. I am tech savvy, running windows 7 plus windows 10 on another platform. I downloaded the Alexa app about 6 weeks ago but cannot get it to connect to the internet after many hours of trying. This is just money thrown out. I will never recommend
