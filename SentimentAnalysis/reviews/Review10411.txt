This leads me to the only criticism I really have: the speaker on the Amazon Echo seems like it is lacking a good bit and not worth $179. That's why I offer up the fact that I also own the Echo Dot, which I have hooked up to my stereo system in my living room. This is where I do the majority of music listening, so having this connected to Spotify and my Bose speakers is awesome. But, when I listen to the Amazon Echo system by itself in my bedroom, you can tell there's a definite difference. (I know I'm comparing this to a Bose system, but I'm just saying - if you want good quality music, you're going to need better speakers.)
