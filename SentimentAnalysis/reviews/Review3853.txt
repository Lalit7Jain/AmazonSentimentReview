I bought to play with.  I really wasn't expecting much, but the Echo was on sale at the time, and I was curious to see what it could do.  And I am really glad I bought it.  It arrives nicely packaged.  Setup was extremely easy.  You do have to download the Alexa app, though, to do so because the app is what enables you to configure the Echo and make use of some of its features.  So you will need to have a smart phone or tablet.  Once set up, though, the Echo works great.
