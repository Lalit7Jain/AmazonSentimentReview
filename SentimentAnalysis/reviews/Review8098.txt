All in all, individually each product has its benefits so my rating is a low 3.  There is just no reason, other than needing a device in a location outside of the primary product's voice range, to purchase more than one device.  My thought is that the Echo-Dot is the most versatile of all 3 products; however, the Echo has better sound quality.  I have noticed the improved sound quality on the Echo; but, the improvement really doesn't make up for the price difference.  If I could do it all again, I'd invest in the Echo Dot for home and an inexpensive Bluetooth speaker for work that I can connect to the iTunes or Pandora applications on my phone.  That way, I will still be able to stream Amazon Prime music through the Dot at home for the stressed pet while playing comforting music in my office.
