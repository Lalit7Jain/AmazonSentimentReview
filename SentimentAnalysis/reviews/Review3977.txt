I have it setup in the living room. Have been using the Echo to turn on the lamp in my living room, play and create stations on Pandora, answer periodic questions on different topics, and it makes rain and thunderstorm sounds when I want to relax. I would eventually like Alexa to be smarter. It cannot answer complex questions like you would find doing a Google search.
