Alexa is solid in its design and coding...to the point that she hears things better than my own Wife.  ;o) In actuality, the Wife really loves it, too.  From weather and traffic reports to playing a particular song list and answering "what does ***** mean" type questions. The far-filed voice recognition is thoroughly impressive and the responsiveness is amazing.
