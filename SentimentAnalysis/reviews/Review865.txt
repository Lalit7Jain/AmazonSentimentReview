Far from as intelligent as advertised, much less so than Siri! I may return it! This is a glorified toy right now! Maybe in the future it will be updated enough to be worthwhile, but I do not recommend it! The big problem is, this will update for a year of two, but it is going to be the second or third generation device that will start to actually be smart, and that will require buying a new unit, as this one will not update beyond a certain point! I suggest waiting!
