Alexa is great to have around the house. I bought this and Google Home (GH) and returned GH. The Bluetooth audio connection is something that Google Home doesn't have and lets me listen to Apple Music. The audio is decent but no Bose. The microphone range is pretty good. I can call Alexa from across the room with the music playing and I don't have to yell.
