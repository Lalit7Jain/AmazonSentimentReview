This device, for me, seems to only be good for calling out songs I want to hear and giving me directions to one specific place. I bought the echo thinking I could bypass my phone for multiple tasks. Except for music Alexa seems pointless. She did convince me to sign up for unlimited amazon music though.... waste of money for me....
