We have a WeMo controlled light, and that was fun to turn on by voice, but not convenient enough to get the Echo for. Granted if we have more, it might have been more valuable. We were debating to get more WeMo/Philips Hue but decided it was more of a gimmick and often confusing to those who just wanted to turn lights on by the switch.
