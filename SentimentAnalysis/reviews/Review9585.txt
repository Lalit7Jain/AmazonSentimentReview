Love this thing. I needed some music in my home, and it sounds great. I also use the timers and shopping list on a regular basis. It is nice to be thinking of an item I need to get and quickly tell Alexa before I forget to write it down, now I just tell Alexa and she logs it for me. She easily recognizes what I am asking and saying when I speak to her. I am sure I will use more and more features as I become more aware of them and it is ever changing and improving.
