I am ultra picky and a perfectionist. also a retired computer professional. I love mainframes, loathe pc's. I actually got my echo from qvc's todays special value. and lest you think i'm old and out of it, I was a church organist, played, still can but not professionally, piano, pipe organ, harpsichord, dulcimer, soprano and alto recorders, electronic organs, electronic keyboards, a cute little thumb piano and the bowed psaltry along with singing folk songs with my brother at performances in college. I do know music. frankly, amazon blew it off this planet with the echo. it is a fantastic device. and unlike most pc's, it does what I ask it to instead of what some programmer erroneously thought what I would want it to do. it plays all sorts of music. tell alexa she's cool. have some more fun and ask her where the cat is (I don't own a cat), ask her to sing a song, tell her goodnight, and then go country or classical or opera asking her to play those kinds of music with a speaker that will blow your mind. I absolutely find the echo the brightest new star in the electronic, computer world. love it!!
