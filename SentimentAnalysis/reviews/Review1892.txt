Bought this from Home Depot approx. 1.5 years ago. Pleasantly surprised by how well this thing works. It isn't perfect, but works very well playing my music, doing searches, giving local weather/traffic info,  playing various games, etc. Awesome sound quality when playing music. Also integrated very well with my Samsung Smartthings home automation system. Looking to buy a few of the smaller "Dot" devices for other rooms at some point.
