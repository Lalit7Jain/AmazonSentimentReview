I am really impressed with the capability of the Amazon Echo.  Originally I thought the device would only respond to my voice; via training it somehow, but it will answer virtually anyone.  My grand kids enjoy "playing" with Alexa.  I opted to pay a monthly fee to access all of Amazon Music's collection of songs.  It has never missed a song yet.  Besides playing music, it really is great when I want to know the weather report or current news events.  It can even do math problems. Try asking it the numerical value of Pi.  It carries it out for more decimal places than I could count.
