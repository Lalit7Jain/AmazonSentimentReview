I also received a Phillips Hue Starter Pack, and already hooked it up through the Echo. There was a bit of a learning curve (advice: light bulb names are important). But after a little effort they all work great. I haven't gotten as far as changing colors through the Echo, but that will be one of my next projects, and I will write about it here.
