Work with a 91year old woman  who is blind - use Jaws - found program provides more than the average home bound blind senior needs - fortunately she is computer literate. Using puff markers on her keyboard for navigation unfortunately in order for her to access her phone numbers I have had to disconnect her Wi-Fi. She prefers her system on all the time and Microsoft often places info i.e. updates, etc in front of her parked open address book and often she  is frustrated as to how to remove them. She also wants to have a calendar for access to days events.
