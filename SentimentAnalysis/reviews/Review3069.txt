Love talking to her.  She has a great speaker system and the quality of the sound that comes out of this thing could be compared to that of speaker-bars with a sub-woofer.  It can fill an entire room (House is my case) with just extraordinary sound.  Love this thing, when she doesn't talk back too me.  She can wake me up or remind me of appointments, turn on/off my TV, set my Airconditioning/Heater temperature etc.  She does everything they say, and a lot more.  She is a programmable piece of good looking furniture.
