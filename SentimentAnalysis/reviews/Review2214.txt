The device itself if fine. However, if you're considering other AMAZON SERVICES via your Echo (i.e. Unlimited music). DON'T! I'm not sure what dictionary amazon is using to define unlimited. But, when amazon has the full catalog of an artist and you can only hear 2 songs on the UNLIMITED MUSIC offering, this is a PROBLEM. Also, if you don't have a premium Spotify account, you can't use Spotify either. However, Pandora and iheartradio work fine. I cancelled the music service because after being BOUNCED AROUND between approximately 8 reps, I never got any RESOLUTION.
