I am so disappointed to have spent a lot of money for a Christmas gift, to discover that it will not work at all on my new computers, Iphones, Kindle Fire, etc!!  Instead of giving a gift that would be fun, exciting, and create a Christmas spirit, I got the Amazon Echo that is frustrating, disappointing, confusing, and simply does not work.  I spent hours on the phone with Amazon, my internet provider, I can not get help from my Netgear router because they offer no tech support at all and are based in Taiwan and Netgear is a ripoff.  It was a huge mistake to purchase the Amazon Echo!  It seems to work fine for millions of others, but is useless on my HP windows 10 computer, Kindle Fire, I phone, tablet, etc.  What a disappointment!!
