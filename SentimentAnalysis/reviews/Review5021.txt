I'm in love with this! I am the most forgetful person ever, I even forget to write something down so I won't forget. So Alexa is my new sanity saver. Shopping list and to do list. I love that I can say " Alexa play me some music" and she'll play what she thinks I may like, and she's usually good at it! Her jokes are so corny they make me laugh. I say "good morning Alexa and she'll tell me the trivia tidbit of the day"
