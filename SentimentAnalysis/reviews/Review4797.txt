Bought this and a Dot. This one is in the family room and the Dot is in the Master Bedroom. Really nice to have around. I have not even scratched the surface of what it can do, but it has been handy to have around. I play lots of music with it and ask it tons of questions. I like the weather reports and news briefings also. The only drawback is that you cannot talk about Alexa without her thinking you are summoning her. If you say something to a human in the room like, "Maybe I should tell Alexa to set an alarm for me so I don't forget to walk the dog" she might hear her name and try to figure out what you are asking for. It's not a huge annoyance and you kind of learn to avoid this after a while, but it can happen. Overall, the performance is very good. Voice recognition is generally accurate, even if I speak a little less than crisply. The Dot makes a great high-tech alarm clock and the speaker in it is fine for nighttime "go to sleep" music. The speaker in the larger Echo is terrific and will fill a pretty large room.
