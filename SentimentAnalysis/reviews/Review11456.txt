On the other hand, most of the time it does what we want it to. I don't order Uber rides or pizza from it. We've bought the occasional song, but mainly use it to stream music and look up traffic and the weather. It still cannot link to Bluetooth speakers to manage our sound system, so we mostly listen out of its speaker. We are deep into the Amazon Prime ecosystem, so it makes sense to stick with the echo, but using it sometimes makes me want to try the Google Home.
