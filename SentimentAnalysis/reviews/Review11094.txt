Alexa, where have you been all my life? So far I've only had my Echo for a week, but I've picked up the bug and I'm already using it regularly every day. After the first couple of days, I went back online and order another Echo and a Dot, and plan to buy a few more dots soon.  Now I'm adding other smart products like Wemo Switches, Phillips Hue bulbs, etc., because once you discover the joy of Alexa, there's no going back to flicking the light switch by hand.  The only reason I didn't give it a full five stars is that I wish I didn't have to purchase an additional device (like Harmony hub) in order to control my TV and streaming channels using my voice.  It would be great to be able to just do it directly with the Echo, the way it controls music. I also wish I could tell Alexa to add multiple items to my shopping list and have them each listed separately without having to say Alexa before each item.  Those are the only two things I would like to see added, but it doesn't stop me LOVING this thing. When I first told my daughter I was getting one, before it arrived I asked if she was excited about it, but in typical teen fashion she said "Ew...no." However, once I set it up in my room and started playing my music, asking Alexa questions, setting my alarms, etc., she changed her tune quickly. I couldn't get a word in, because she took over giving Alexa instructions. Now she's calling dibs on the Dot that's on the way!
