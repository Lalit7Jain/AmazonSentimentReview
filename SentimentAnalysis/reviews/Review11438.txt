I have spent the last year adding devices to create a smart home. We have about 30 Philips hue bulbs, some z-wave switches, a Harmony Ultimate remote with hub, and a Smartthings Hub. The Echo was the best addition to the setup I could have ever added. We come home and ask Alexa to turn on the living room and the lamp and the TV turn on for us. It was so simple to setup and add skills, I wish I would have done it sooner!
