I cannot live without Alexa in my life.  It helps me perform seemingly simple chores, like making a shopping list, turning on my lights when my hands are full, turning my TV on and off.  Integrating with my security system, and so much more.  It's simple to use and novelty tricks like tell me a joke and what's the weather keeps the rest of my family entertained.
