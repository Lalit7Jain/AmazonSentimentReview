just loading all my music and apps. I'm not gay but I am in love with Alexa! For those curious about iTunes music, I just uploaded my iTunes music to the Amazon cloud and am happy to report my iTunes library and playlists are not lost. But then who needs them with Pandora? This device has already changed my life. I love being able to just ask what time a certain store is open as opposed to looking it up on google. I also appreciate asking Alexa for the definition of any word. I would highly recommend this device. It will change your life. I can't wait for Monday when I wake to get ready for work to see how much time I save by asking for the weather report, my schedule, etc... One thing I've noticed is how the tendency is to speak with authority and clear, but that's not necessary. Just speak in your normal voice. She listens. She's really great.
