I have one Echo and two Dots.  One dot is in the kitchen for timers, lists and music while I cook and clean.  The other dot is in my bedroom for wakeup alarms (say "Alexa, Snooze" and you'll get another 9 minutes or so!) and to play soothing music before I sleep, and then I ask for current news ("Alexa, Flash Briefing") and weather before I get out of bed in the morning), and the Echo is in my study for music, questions, games, plans, audio books, etc.
