I was very pleased with it and even bought smart home products, but since this thing can't even last a year, now I have to run several apps on my phone just to shut everything down at night instead of just telling Alexa to do it.  Super Annoyed.  Super waste of my time and money.  $180 down the drain.  Guess I'll check out Google Home instead.
