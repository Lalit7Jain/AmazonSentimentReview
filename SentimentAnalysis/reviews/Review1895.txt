An absolute gem! My wife has Alzheimer's, but still has MUSIC in her soul, and thanks to Alexa, I don't have to dig through my extensive CD collection to get her to sing and dance! Only problem is turning up the volume too loud, and Alexa can't hear my next song request...but we're getting some exercise and entertainment over here! Highly recommended, lots of fun!
