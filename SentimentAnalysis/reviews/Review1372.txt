After  having this in our home for a short period of time, we felt it was way too "weird".  The information obtained through media sources that these devices are "ON" at all times is creepy to say the least.  Not that we are talking about anything others cannot hear - the mere fact that these devices allow eavesdropping by government or outside intruders of any kind is unacceptable by "FREE" citizens.  If we all continue to accept these devices into our everyday lives we are setting ourselves up for a future similar to "The Hunger Games", Divergent, etc.  "1984" is definitely not part of my future agenda for life in the United States .... all these technical wonders have not been perfected enough for safety within our homes.  I do not even subscribe to Facebook because I do not like the intrusion on my personal life - I choose to share my personal life with people I trust....and that does not include Government and whomever wishes to harm me.
