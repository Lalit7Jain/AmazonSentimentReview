I am still learning all Alexa/Echo can do. I have not bought any of the products that will work with Echo to turn on lights & other functions. I can get the weather, listen to all kinds of music either from my Amazon Music library, Pandora, i Heart Radio or Tune in. As I am typing, I am listening to the news from NPR. The quality of the sound it excellent & I can hear it from any room in my house,.
