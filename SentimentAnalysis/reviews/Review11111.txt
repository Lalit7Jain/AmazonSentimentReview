I am very disappointed to have to say this, but while I love the Echo--a very well designed piece of hardware which is very handy and plays radio and music very well--I am afraid that Alexa is really, really stupid. I keep having to pull out my laptop and ask OK Google even simple questions like movie times at theaters, or who my state representative is. My hope is that Amazon will make an effort to make Alexa more useful. Good for shopping and to-do lists and to play radio programs and music, but otherwise really pretty useless.
