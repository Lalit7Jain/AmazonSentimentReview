Alexa is okay, but she needs some serious upgrades to keep information current. She also needs to be reprogrammed so it is not so painful to ask a question using the exact correct phrasing. The programmers need to stay on top of the apps already listed in the Skills section instead of adding more and more skills that are not well thought out.  Do your homework Amazon: stay on top of things or we will be forced to switch to GOOGLE!!!
