Difficult to set-up and I am still working on it. This was a Christmas gift and seems to be a waste of money for so little that is working. There needs to actual instructions step by step on how to set up the applications. My Alexa doesn't answer questions and I am unsure why. VERY Dissatisfied and it is collecting dust.
