My family uses this primarily for playing music and to keep a shopping list, which I can pull up on my Alexa app when in the store.  Even though we have a whole-house sound system, the sound quality from this Echo is so good that we hardly miss the expensive system.  This morning I heard my daughter say "Alexa, add hair clips to the shopping list" and my son say "Alexa, play Toby Mac."  Voice recognition is freakishly good.
