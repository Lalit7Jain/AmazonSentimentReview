Ok a week later I figured it out. I google everything when I have a question but you have to ask Alexa to Wikipedia everything because it Won't connect to Google....I find that is Sucks as i don't like being directed to any specific web site. If I can type it on my phone or iPad I shoul be able to direct it by voice. Would I buy this again.....I'm still on the fence but I am removing a star
