I have owned my Echo now for about 9-10 months and have now added 3 additional Amazon 2nd generation DOTS around my house.  I've been in the process of setting my house up as a smart house, within reason, by turning on and off lights and appliance.  I also have my Vivint home security system/smart house set up through the Amazon system which gives me control of my door locks, thermostat and arming and disarming my security system itself.  Recently I added a Harmony Elite remote control with hub control to my home theater and now have the echo and dots controlling my home theater also.  All this is great and I don't know what I would do now without my Amazon Echo and DOTS. I only have one major complaint about the Amazon Echo/DOTS.  I've looked all over your web site for a simple email address where I could make a recommendation concerning them but to no avail.  I'm not about to call and talk to a low level telephone person about a recommendation because it would never get to the people who could do something about it, namely the software engineers who program the system.  Since this seems to be the only route available here goes:  I'm 72 years old and my hearing is not very good anymore, especially in the middle and high ranges of the audio spectrum.  In other words, human voices, especially female voices, so I have a lot of trouble understanding Alexa when she tries to give me information I need or want. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE program a simple software change that will allow us to switch to a male voice for Alexa if needed.  You can even add a male name such as Alex.  I can understand a deeper male voice much better than a female voice and I wouldn't be struggling every day to try to understand the information I've asked Alexa for.  I hope these reviews are actually read by people at Amazon who can do something about this.  Otherwise, I've wasted my time and yours.
