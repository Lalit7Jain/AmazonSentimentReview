a. Connectivity - if you are not using the device for a while, as little as a week, it (mine) needs to be reconnected manually to the wifi every time, and after several times of this, now, it does not even connect at all and refers me to the alexa app help section which makes me re try the connection manually again, which seems like it works, only to disconnect in 2 minutes and the same cycle repeats itself over and over again. Truly frustrating.
