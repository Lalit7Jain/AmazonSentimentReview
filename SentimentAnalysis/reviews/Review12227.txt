Also ECHO would be a great addition to the Senior Citizen community of those living alone  and some what infirmed still  wanting to stay in their homes - as a choice - with only TV as their on call companion. Granted Meals on Wheels pops in Monday  to Friday and perhaps a local care giver but to have a gracious gentle voice speaking to you as Alexa answer your requests would be terrific - (there is a time in elder life when your children and care givers decide they know best.)
