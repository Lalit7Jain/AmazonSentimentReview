Next reason why I like Echo...Music.  I am a Amazon Prime member and I enjoy listening to music as does my husband.  I now get to come home and tell "Alexa" to play my music.  I don't have to fiddle with my phone, there's no cords, no cd's, no anything....it just simply works.  Before I would come home and "set up my music" and then get to cleaning - now there's nothing to set up I just start cleaning and when I want to change I simply command her to change.
