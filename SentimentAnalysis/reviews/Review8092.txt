If you need or want to know the local weather or get  flash news updates on command, the Echo or Echo Dot are your devices.  I, on the other hand, use them for music streaming.  I find that the "sleep function" has flaws, voice recognition/comprehension needs great improvement and everyone should know that it is really unnecessary to buy more of these devices unless you have multiple amazon music accounts such that you can stream on those separate accounts from different locations/rooms.  Otherwise, users should know that the devices cannot be linked together for simultaneous streaming.  They also cannot be used by different parties to stream different music from each different device.  Apparently, Amazon Prime Music only allows streaming to one device at a time.
