"Alexa" is great! We are getting used to each other and how to ask her questions. It makes us laugh because of how she responds sometimes. She has a lot of different apps that you can enable. The one we use the most so far is the Flash Briefing. We have yet to explore everything she is able to do, but we are very happy with our purchase.
