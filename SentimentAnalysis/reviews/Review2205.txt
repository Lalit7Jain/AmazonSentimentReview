2.  "Honeywell Total Connect Comfort".  I first  purchased a Honeywell Wi-Fi Smart Thermostat that was "Amazon Certified to work with Alexa".  I purchased Model RTH9580.  It was around $160.  After reading the reviews,  I made sure that I had a Heating and Cooling professional install it--otherwise, I gather that the manufacturer will not honor the warranty.  I registered myself on the Honeywell website as required, loaded the app on my phone, and enabled Alexa.  Now I can control my home thermostat by phone app, or by voice with Alexa.  Alexa will (again, only with proper wording), tell me what the thermostat is set to, or what the temperature currently is,  and will lower or raise said temperature on command.
