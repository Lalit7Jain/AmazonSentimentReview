I like the Echo, it is certainly a step in the right direction.  However, there are a few things that I hate about it.  For example, being forced to call the device Alexa is somewhat annoying.  It is a personal assistant I paid for, I want to be able to call it what I want.  2nd gripe is that we cannot change the voice.  3rd gripe is that there is no 3.5 mm audio input/output jack.
