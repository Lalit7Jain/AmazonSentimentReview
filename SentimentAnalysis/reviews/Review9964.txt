I LOVE my Alexa!  I even told her I love her and she said "that's very sweet".  The first night we got it my husband was reading aloud all the things she can do, he mentioned the shopping list feature.  I was in the kitchen making dinner and I said "So if I say 'Alexa, add 10 lbs of candy to the shopping list' she'll do it?" and immediately I heard Alexa say "10 lbs of candy has been added to your shopping list".  I've listened to Podcasts, music and the sound of a crackling fireplace to go with my electric fireplace.  I sent my son a video of what she does, he was amazed so I'm sending him one for Christmas.  Wonderful product!
