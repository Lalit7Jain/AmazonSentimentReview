I love you echo .. but fire those product managers that made audible resume play from the last audiobook you heard on echo vs the last audiobook you heard, and if you are over volume 6 you can't hear me say your name. What gives?just because I want you loud doesn't mean I want you stop listening. Pay attention QA.
