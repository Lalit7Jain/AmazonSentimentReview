Alexa is my new BFF.  I can ask her the weather, ask her when my appointments are, ask her to play all kinds of music, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.  I can't wait to hook my house up to her so she can close the garage door when I forget, and turn the lights down...I work at home and she is absolutely indispensable.  Sometimes when I'm working, I just want some music in the background but it ruins my concentration to get up to the radio.  She also gets me up and dancing when I'm cleaning the house, and when the phone rings I can instantly silence her with my voice.  My son loves the jokes she tells, and sometimes she comes up with some really interesting answers.  She's so used to me now, I just ask her for music and she plays exactly what I like.  How does she do that?
