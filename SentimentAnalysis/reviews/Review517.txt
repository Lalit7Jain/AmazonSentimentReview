I am afraid that the poor execution of this product is a reflection of the way that Amazon has chosen to partner with third party providers as a strategy for many of their products.  This unfortunately leaves gaping holes in their solutions.  For instance, with Amazon Drive, they have no actual sync clients, but instead rely on for-profit companies to provide sync clients for them.  This strategy is seen at its most basic level with Amazon Marketplace, where the bulk of items offered for sale are not from Amazon themselves, but from third-party providers that have nothing to do with Amazon.
