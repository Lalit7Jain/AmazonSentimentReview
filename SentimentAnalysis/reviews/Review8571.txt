Also, it seems Amazon and Apple seem to be in the middle of a hissyfit, and currently failing to support each other's products. None of the Apple applications work with Alexa directly. So, if you live in the apple universe this product may not before you, perhaps wait until Apple inevitably releases a similar project. As an aside, this is a mistake by Amazon. Alexa is great and I want it to work with my other products, but if doesn't I will eventually move to something else (rant over).
