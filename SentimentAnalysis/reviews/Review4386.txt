I'm new to the Echo world and only have had it for a few hours but i have to say I love Alexa :) I just ordered a Dot for my mother, whom is going to be 79 on the 31st :) My son will help her set it up. I will update as I play with Alexa (sound's so wrong) lol.  I did my research with friend's on Facebook and not one stated anything negative about this product, quite the opposite. One few of them have ordered dot's for different rooms in there home. Alexa is even familiar with Iron Maiden :)
