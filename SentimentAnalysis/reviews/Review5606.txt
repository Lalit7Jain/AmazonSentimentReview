We are loving Alexa. The software is still improving, so probably a 4 star is more appropriate- except are you kidding me?? It can tell me the weather, do math, provide proper spelling of words, convert measurements, set a timer, make a grocery list, and plays lots of amazing music. It will continue to get better and that will be amazing, too. But seriously- this is super cool! also, the sound quality is really impressive for such a small devise. Bravo.
