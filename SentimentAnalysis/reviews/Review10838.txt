Cons: The promise of integration is very good, however it only got 4 out 5 stars because of certain partnerships not in place yet. I use slacker radio and would like to see that integration. I would also like to see more news outlets available for selection, especially the NPR content. More skills content does get added all the time, but having a better way for customers to request features and track them would be nice.
