 However, within the last two weeks my Echo all of a sudden will not connect to my WiFi at all.  I have tried everything.  I get through all the setup and it immediately drops connect.  I own two devices and my other device does not have this problem.  So I know there is a defect in the unit.  I have taken my issue up with Amazon's Echo support team.  With my device still under warranty they are beating around the bush to send me a replacement.  They want to troubleshoot over the phone, have their techs look into the issue, and then a week later want to troubleshoot some more over the phone.  This is the most irritating thing.  It has been three weeks now, my Echo still doesn't work and now Amazon wants to troubleshoot some more instead of replacing the unit.  I'm tired of troubleshooting, I have done everything on Amazon's troubleshooting guide, I have done their phone troubleshooting, and I have followed guides on YouTube and the internet.  Nothing fixes it, it's defective.  They cannot blame my ISP, WiFi, placement of the unit, or anything else because my other unit works just fine.  This threw them off their game when they tried to tell me to check all these things and I pointed out that my other Echo works just fine.  Now they just want to troubleshoot with me some more.  Hopefully I can get the issue resolved and have a new or refurbished unit sent to me, because I really do like having a separate unit for my basement.  I'm really just loosing faith in Amazon's customer support and their inability to stand behind their product.
