"Alexa" can be viewed as useful, since she can set a timer for your baking, give you the time and/or weather conditions, etc. She can be entertaining, especially if you have an Amazon Prime  account with music and audio book connections. She's also very tolerant during the "learning" process, and very astute in picking up the uniqueness of ones request patterns. A very satisfying addition to our household. Plus, she can serve as the centerpiece of holiday decorations, if you like.
