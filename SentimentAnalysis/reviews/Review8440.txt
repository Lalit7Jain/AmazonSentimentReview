I was once a big fan of this device, but the Alexa app is getting almost unusable. When I ask for "Johann Sebastian Bach," for some reason, it gives me George Winston and J.S. Back. This continues with almost all my music requests, regardless of whether they're in my library or not. If I'd wanted George Winston, I'd have at least BOUGHT some of his elevator music. It seems incapable of playing one artist from my library without pushing an irrelevant "suggestion."
