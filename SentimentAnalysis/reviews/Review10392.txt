My wife bought me an Amazon Echo for my birthday this past September.  I really like the device and have had great listening music through iHeartRadio, HOWEVER, with the holiday season upon us we cannot get iHeartRadio to play the iHeart Christmas station.  I can play the station through the app on my smartphone but Alexa DOES NOT recognize the station.  I've been in contact with Amazon about this and they tell me several people have reported this issue and it's unknown when and if it will be addressed and they have recommended that I utilize another 3rd party music provider.  All other iHeartRadio stations work with the exception of the Christmas station.  As a Christian, I find this to be suspect.  If this matter is resolved in a timely fashion I'd consider a higher review but I'm not going to hold my breath.
