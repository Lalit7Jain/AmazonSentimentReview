I love the sound on this speaker. My music sounds really clear and crisp. You could have a party in your home with this speaker, yes it gets just that loud with no distortion. Alexa is great, I can tell her to play my Playlist, or my favorite station, the news, the weather, tell jokes, order from Amazon, or turn my lights on, and control the heat in my house. My wish for future for Echo is to Bluetooth to other Echos or Dots, so I can play the same music all over the house.
