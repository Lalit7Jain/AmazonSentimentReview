After reading a lot of reviews I pulled the trigger and got one. I was very pleased to find out the sound is very good, some felt it didn't have good enough speakers, but for our kitchen it sounds great. Alexa answers every question and does so with impressive speed, i was amazed.  We use the shopping list which is very easy and convenient to use. News, weather, music, everything you need, highly recommend just for these features, have yet to explore the many other options such as controlling lights, etc.  Don't just sit there reading reviews, buy it!
