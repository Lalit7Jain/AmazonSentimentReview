Love it! I have enjoyed my Amazon Echo however I was lucky in that I already had Amazon prime and it worked great. My friend bought one and did not have Prime and she was going to have to download all the songs she wanted to a play list on it.  I love my echo but was not planning on keeping Prime. Now of course I will. That was unexpected expense.
