I bought Alexa for Christmas, based on the reviews and capability; I mostly use it for music and as alarm and I enjoy this great companion in my household. Weather forecast, sports results and scores, latest news are another perks I do enjoy. Light switches, sprinklers, etc is my future plan, but need to do more research.
