- I should be able to create a to-do list for my husband.  This is a major flaw.  If my husband is on my Amazon family profile, I need to be able to create items for him.  As in, "Alexa, put fix faucet on my husband's to-do list." Seriously, this is supposed to be be a family gadget, so why can I only create one to-do list?  Very primitive.
