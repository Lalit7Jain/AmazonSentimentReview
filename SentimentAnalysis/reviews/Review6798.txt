I would have given it a five but. I have several times where it didnot do anything. Have talked to Tech support and they tried to help. It is one of those things where it is sporatic and of coarse with anything it has to be consistent. Maybe be something with my internet service as they are less the desirable.  I bought this for my husband for christmas. He likes being able to call the old music up that is no longer playing. I don't know why anyone would want to pay for the music  as there is so much music out there. I love the quality coming out of the speakers sounds like a big system. But other then the problem I stated above.Loved Loved Loved it. Little suggestion for techs at Amazon would like to be able to send the grocery list to my wireless printer but I have talked to several people and there doesn't seem to be any way right now.
