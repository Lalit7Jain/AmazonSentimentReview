Very easy to setup and configure.  The sound quality of the speaker is very good, the voice recognition is also effective across the room from a good range.  The skills are varied, it would be nice to continue to see additions here.  I want to try the lights and switches when I order them.  The app for my iPhone is a little slow although that may be because of so many people trying to set up today.  I am going to order at least one Dot for another floor of my home, I am excited to see the future of this product.
