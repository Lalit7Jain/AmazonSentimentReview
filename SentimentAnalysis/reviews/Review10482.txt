Very satisfied with my purchase of the refurbished Echo. Works perfectly and actually the refurbished model exceeds my expectations. Love all the features and ease of use especially when used with the Android phone app. With the phone app you can turn on or off lights anywhere you have cell service. Picked up a couple of the TP-Link Smart Wi-Fi plugs. Now I just say "Alexa, turn on the Christmas Tree". No more climbing around the tree looking for the plug. Also, have Echo turn on and off the living room lights. That's nice if you're in bed and hear a strange noise in the house. You can turn on the lights without even getting up. Have plans to add a Wi-Fi wall switch to turn on the bedroom ceiling fan. Ever get in bed and forget to turn on the fan - No problem with Alexa's help. Be sure to check out all the Skills for Echo now available and more to be added.
