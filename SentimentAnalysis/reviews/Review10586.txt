Echo is GREAT for adding items to my shopping or to-do lists!  Sometimes the app is laggy or won't open at all when I'm in the grocery store and really need my shopping list.  Instead I've been taking a screenshot of the shopping list so I can pull it up quickly.  I"m still amazed they haven't created a widget for using the shopping/to-do lists to make them easier to access.  ..... but I believe things like this are in the works.
