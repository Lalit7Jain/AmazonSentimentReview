When I ask for a specific song, I might get it to play because it’s actually in Prime (I’ve been a Prime shipping member since the beginning). But more often, I will get a pitch for the “Unlimited” music at $8 per month, and a short sample of the song I wanted to hear to try to upsell me to an expensive service I don’t want.
