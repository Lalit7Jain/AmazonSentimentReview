I got this item for my wife because she fell in love with our friends Echo Alexa. it was suppose to be a Christmas present but she opened as soon as it was delivered to put it to work.  She is not to technical as a person but she was able to set everything up herself and connect the book readings, shopping list, and endless music streams to her Samsung Phone via app.  Maybe Alexa will find her a new husband.  lol
