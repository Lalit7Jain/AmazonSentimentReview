This is a great device.  I am amazed at the quality of the speakers. It is one of the few genuinely helpful electronic devices in my home.  A quick check of the time and weather and I'm out the door!  Setting timers is super helpful .  My husband loves the news flash briefings from NPR.  I love the music.  Looking forward to exploring all the things that Alex's can do!!
