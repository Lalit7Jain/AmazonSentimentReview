What can I say that hasn't been said about the Amazon Echo. It is an awesome product, I use it in everyday life from playing music to controlling my smart home devices in my home. I even won over my wife and she loves it. The seven microphones can pick up my voice across my entire home. Its tied directly into my home automation system and combine with IFTTT the possibilities are endless.
