Have only had this for a week and we are still learning how to speak to it (her), but we are having a blast learning...daily weather, news briefs, election coverage, the occasional bad joke and the ability to keep up with our weekly grocery list...these are all within Alexa's scope of work...not to mention she can order an charge to my CC when i order on Domino's ..cool
