Almost 99% of skills I've used have been useless. I find myself using the basic things that Amazon has included within it. For music, it's great! It's a great speaker that has intelligence built in...so it's a perfect music player. I've integrated it with Spotify. It's able to read all my playlists. It works great and always manages to understand what track/artist I'm looking for. It doesn't do well with music that's not Western music...so, just beware that you can't have it look for tracks or artists that don't have western names. It may work sometimes, I guess. The speaker is actually really good. It's no Bose, but it is very good. It's not tinny, it's got some decent bass, which works well with music or talk.
