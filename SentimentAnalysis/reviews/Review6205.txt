Can I just say: WOW. I've been curious about this device for a long time now, and I finally got one for Christmas. The Echo is just amazing. Capable of playing Amazon Music AND Spotify (on some pretty excellent speakers, I might add), giving you daily weather and news updates, adding items to your shopping or to-do list, and of course answering nearly any fact-based question, this device provides HOURS of entertainment. The "skills" library is also pretty neat; you can enable your Echo to do very specific tasks or play games with you. Lots of possibilities there. Beyond all the bells and whistles, the sensitivity and functionality of the Echo is unbelievable. It can hear me say the wake word from literally ANY room in my house, no matter the distance, and it can differentiate between me saying, "Alexa" trying get its attention and just saying "Alexa" in the middle of a sentence, which is to say that it can read your tone so well that it doesn't activate when saying the wake word simply in passing. I am usually so frustrated with these voice command devices, because they never seem to hear what I'm saying correctly. NOT so with the Echo; Alexa hears me accurately nearly every time, no matter how complex my command or question is. The way this thing picks up sound is just incredible. Never seen anything like it. After just a few days, this product has become such a fixture in our living room that we have started talking about Alexa like she's a person! I'm definitely going to try out the Echo Dot for my bedroom, just so I can have the mini version separately. Really excellent; I simply can't rate this product highly enough.
