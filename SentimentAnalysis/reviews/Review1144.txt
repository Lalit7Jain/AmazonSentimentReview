I've had this product since Sept. 2016 and I'm very disappointed in it.  I've been on the phone 3 different times with customer service for the product trying to reset it.  Each time this took close to an hr.  It keeps returning to the red circle which means its off line.  While I enjoyed the selection of music it gave me and the quality of sound,  I'm to frustrated to get on the phone again and reset it.  Now I find out I can't return it even for credit.  This product is a not ready for market in my opinion.
