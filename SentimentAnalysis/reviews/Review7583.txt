Alsa we just didn't connect...its not me...it's you...I have three other successful connections on ATT Uverse WiFi. But you kept telling me we aren't connected. Just to make sure, I went to my other network (don't pretend you didn't know about that!) my ATT personal Hot Spot. After trying over and over, doing the same thing, expecting different results, (INSANITY, Right??!?!?!?) you are so clearly the problem. As compatible as it seemed we would become, it's just not meant to be. It's over. Don't try to talk me out of it, the shipping label is already printed. I hope you find a happy connection with some other starry eyed optimist. I've given you the best 4 hours of my life and it's over.
