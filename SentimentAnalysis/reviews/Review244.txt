We love ECHO. I understand now though that certain questions which Alexa is unable to answer, require certain apps which seem simple enough to obtain. I also now understand that there are other products which can likewise be added to so that Alexa can handle issues like hearing your voice from greater distances. Lastly, if you're playing music at volumes as high as 10, you need to physically be upon ECHO and speak loudly  in order for Alexa to respond to any other requests. Overall, it's an amazing purchase and we're considering gifting family members with one in the future.
