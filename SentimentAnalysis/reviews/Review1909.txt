I don't think we get the most out of it our echo.  The echo basically sits there and gets little use other than when anything on T.V. says Alexa.  Some of the things I would like it to do require another piece which is really expensive.  The lights, thermostat, and locking devices are all priced too high.  So, its a speaker that answers questions but my Receiver works better for music and we have tablets...  So, it sits and waits for me to tell it to sing to me.
