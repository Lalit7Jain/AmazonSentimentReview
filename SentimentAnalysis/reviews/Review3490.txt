This has been AMAZING for my husband, who is disabled. I still work full-time and he is alone for most of the day. He typically watches a lot of tv, but since I bought the Echo (Alexa!), he has begun to enjoy playing songs from when we were young. I purchased Amazon Music Unlimited, since some of the artists and songs he likes are not available on the free version of Spotify (and the paid version of Spotify is more expensive than Amazon Music). Even better for his mental acuity, he's now hooked on playing sports trivia and especially baseball trivia. There are MANY baseball trivia apps (and football trivia, hockey trivia, etc)  and I think I've enabled all of them. I made him a list of phrases that Alexa will respond to, in order to open the different apps. He also likes to play the animal game occasionally and 20 Questions.
