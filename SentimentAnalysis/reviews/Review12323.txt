The Echo is a mainstay in my living room. Additional features are okay, but they need to release BIGGER features that everybody would use instead of providing to niche users every week. Great for home automation, but really lacks on pondering questions. Alexa does not attempt to look up relevant information and will instead just tell you that she does not understand.
