I got this for task management and only task management. But it reverses the proper order from Todoist and I'm sending it back. It always gives me the most recent tasks, giving no preference to what is due. I want to do my oldest first, and I will never get to old tasks if I am only doing my latest tasks. Whoever configured this does not use a task list, I'm sure.
