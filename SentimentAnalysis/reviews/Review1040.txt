Long time Echo owner and I still feel strongly enough about Alexa to write a positive review and it's been at least a year and a half.  She's become a fixture in my home and I use her everyday for music, timers, weather, news, and other random stuff.  She feels like a real person and has so many capabilities that each owner can use her to their liking.  I can see Amazon's commitment to upgrading the Echo and staying on the cutting edge of connectivity and artificial intelligence over the time I've owned it.  I fully recommend the Echo (Alexa) to anyone and everyone.  Amazon did a great job with this one.
