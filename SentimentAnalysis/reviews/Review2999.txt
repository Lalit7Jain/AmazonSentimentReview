2. the additional things that Echo can do are limited by the implementation of the interface.  For each of the 'skills' you'd like to use, you have to go into the app and turn them on.  This seems like a pretty simple task, but with literally hundreds of skills available and having to remember how to activate them (using the correct phrase), it becomes to cumbersome to find and use these.  When comparing to Home, 'skills' just work and it's only a question of whether they have been implemented.
