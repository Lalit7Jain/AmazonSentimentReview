Just a tip if you use the Hue lights, do not name your light bulbs and your rooms similar.  While it seems logical and it works fine in Hue, Alexa will have problems with this.  For example I had a bulbs called Kitchen 1, and Kitchen 2, and a room called Kitchen.  Alexa would get confused with this when I'd say something like "Alexa Kitchen on 100%"  It thought I was trying to control Kitchen 1.
