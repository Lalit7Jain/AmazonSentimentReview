No one can say anything more accurate (and damning) about the Echo/Alexa experience than what Amazon itself said. It It reads news/weather, answers random useless trivia questions (e.g. "How far away is Pluto?") and plays music. That's it. If you find asking it what the population of Peru is, or how many rods there are in a mile, then buy it. This is simply not compelling to me.
