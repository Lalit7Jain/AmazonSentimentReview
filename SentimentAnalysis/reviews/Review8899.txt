Great concept, so so delivery.  Entertaining for jokes, nice to play music but do you really need a Domino's pizza? (Disclaimer: Don't like Domino's pizza).  "Always getting smarter" doesn't seem real when I have been asking Alexa for going on two years "What is the current wind chill factor?"" Alexa will give you the full weather forecast but has yet to master a basic request even though I, and sure many others, have asked the crack team of Amazon developers to add it.  "Alexa, order me an Uber" and then hope you don't get frostbite waiting for it. Rather disappointing Amazon won't put a feature in unless they can readily monetize it.
