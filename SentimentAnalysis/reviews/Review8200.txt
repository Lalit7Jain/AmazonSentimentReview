I'm currently looking into prosthetics so she has the ability to walk.  Doctors can be so heartless and cruel! They'll say thinks like "IT WONT EVER WALK", or "GET OUT OF MY OFFICE" or they start asking questions about me, "ARE YOU INTOXICATED SIR?" and  "ARE YOU MENTALLY STABLE?", but what do they know!  I'm going to design and modify a roller skate, to function like a human babys walker.  We've talked about putting her on the Roomba, but the maternal instinct in me, fears she'd fall and get hurt.
