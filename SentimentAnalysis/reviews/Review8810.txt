I bought the Echo for my father who is in a nursing home. Mentally he is all there but physically he needs assistance. I thought this would be a perfect companion but it took me awhile to learn commands and skills so we kept it at home while we learned. Our next issue was it could easily come up missing or be knocked off the table (as lamps have). When I read about Echo Dot, I thought it'd be perfect for Christmas (I bought 6) but I couldn't wait that long. My father, 79, has been enjoying "Alexa" for a few months and I'm so glad I didn't wait for Christmas. We are keeping a Dot for our bedroom.....and since I love them so much I bought more to give away! Perfect Christmas present for all on my list, from ages 6 to 80. My only complaint is my husband likes to take over and has a difficult time sharing! :)
