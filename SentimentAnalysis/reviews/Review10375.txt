OK, so I've had my Echo for a few months now and it is terrific.  Love using the skills.  The speakers are awesome and can output very clear music.  Only downside is it's inability to do some simple searches.  (i.e. When is XYZ television show aired?) Hoping as it "learns" it's searching ability is more consistent.
