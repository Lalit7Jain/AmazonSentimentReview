We recieved one as a gift. Initially we had fun seeing what it could do. Unfortunately the only useful function it really has is playing music. And recently that function has been buggy, with problems finding music and controlling volume. As a software developer I even tried to write a "skill" for the device but Amazon demands that developers PAY AMAZON to write free skills for either own platform. Needless to say I quit trying to help them.
