Not impressed but it is an interesting novelty, albeit a bit expensive. Got this because my wife wanted it. My wife (bless her heart) cannot figure out how to ask the right questions so is constantly getting responses saying Alexa doesn't understand the question. She then insults Alexa which prompts me to apologize to Alexa, however silly that is. I use her to play music and tell me the weather but that's about it. Would not purchase again, doesn't fit my life at all.
