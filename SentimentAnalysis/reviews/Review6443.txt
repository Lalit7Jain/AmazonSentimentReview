Love my Echo for playing music on Spotify and controlling the lights in my home. Sometimes it has issues picking up when I say "Alexa" when the music is a bit loud. This is understandable, but can also be a bit frustrating when needing to turn the volume down quickly. Overall, I am very happy with my Amazon Echo.
