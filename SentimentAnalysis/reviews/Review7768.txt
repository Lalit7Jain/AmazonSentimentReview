Great sound, accurate voice recogition, sturdy build, and good sound. This thing is the whole package. Plus all the new features with every update are great. I only have one minor complaint about not getting my free 3 months of amazon music even though it said I did :/. Lame. Other than that This thing is literally the begining of smart homes. I finally have a reason to buy "smart" appliances! Thank you Amazon for being amazing.
