With a 2-year head start on Google Home and integration with Amazon Prime Music for the millions of Prime subscribers, Amazon Echo is the king of smart homes right now.  Add in the fact that you can add on Amazon Dots all over the house for $50 each.  I also just bought the Google Home and unfortunately, in its current state, the Google Home is just a gimmick for me as it does not integrate with the Harmony hub.  I don't have any other smart devices like lights, switches, etc. in the house.
