But on the plus side, this may be the most fun life-interface you'll ever have.  I like waking up and asking Alexa about the temp outside and then asking her to shuffle a playlist for me while I'm getting ready for work.  She can hear me from any room in my condo.  If you've never said: "Alexa, wikipedia Ionizing Radiation" or asked her if she's self-aware, you're just not using your imagination.
