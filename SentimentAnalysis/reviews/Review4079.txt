Bought mine in January 2915 and never works for more than 5 minutes at a time.  Randomly out of the blue through the  day says "Having trouble understanding right now.  Please try again a little later."  It just sits there because I would have to go through the whole set up process each time to use it.  It may be my Internet but it has been a disappointment.
