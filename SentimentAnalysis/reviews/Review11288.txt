The Echo/Alexa speaker is great.  I like it because I don't want to raise my voice to ask Alexa a question or command.  I speak at a low voice or even a slight whisper and it picks it up and does what I ask.  I like the ability to add more "Skills" to the device and give it more ability to respond.
