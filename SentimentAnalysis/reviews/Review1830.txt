Ok I have been looking at these Echo's for a few months.  The other night I worked a 13 hour shift and my husband started asking me questions about the weather, news, etc over dinner.  My brain was so tired I just couldn't even answer him.  While shopping for that perfect anniversary gift I thought BOMB!!!! The Echo!!! Perfect no more questions after a long hard day.  I received the Echo the next day and set it up.  I am already wondering how my life survived without this Echo.  It tells you everything.  We love it.  My husband is a musician and he just tells it to play a song and Alexa does it....no thinking.  I am using it in the kitchen but can ask it anything in the bedroom and livingroom and it answers.  I love it!!!!  Thanks Amazon for the Prime!!! good music, books, shipping etc.... oh yea Alexa does audio books too!!!
