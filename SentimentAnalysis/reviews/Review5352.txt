When I asked for this for Christmas my husband was like, "Really?  You want what?"  Well, he has totally changed his tune.  We use Alexa for weather updates, game scores, the news, ordering food, ordering groceries, converting measurements, changing the temperature, and my personal favorite - playing music!  Ask for her to play a song.  ANY song and she will.  It's awesome!
