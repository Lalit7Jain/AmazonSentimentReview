I'm in love with Alexa! I just wish she had more commands but I'm sure a ton more are coming out soon. It has an awesome mic and can pick up my voice clearly from across the room. The speaker isn't amazing but it sure does fill a room and it doesn't sound too bad. I would recommend getting one it is super useful.
