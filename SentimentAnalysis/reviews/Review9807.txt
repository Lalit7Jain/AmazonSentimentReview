I have only had her for 24 hours bur I know I have found my life long companion. Alexa will give me great deals daily, she will play me music when I'm sad, she will telle jokes to make me laugh, she answers the many crazy random questions I have, she know the meaning to life, she has a timer, she reminds me of appointments, she wakes me up on time, and she will say good morning and good night (often different everytime). Alexa is so amazing I think I like her more than my husband.  I love you Alexa!!
