For users that want to play their own libraries, the short answer is it's bad.  The free option is the smallest amount of storage among all the major players (250 songs), and it's not possible to sync playlist.  It might have some hidden option to sync iTunes playlist, but as far as I know MediaMonkey users have no options to import m3u playlist or read the database file.  You want playlist, it's a tedious manual job.  You can do it by folder, but that's about it.  To listen to your own music, you can fork over another ~25 a year if you have more than 250 songs.  You might be better off purging your library periodically and limiting yourself to a favorite playlist.  To put it bluntly, Alexa's recognition of songs in the library is bad.  It will tell you that you don't have songs that you uploaded.  You'll have to use the mobile app, making Alexa about as useful as $60 Bluetooth speaker.
