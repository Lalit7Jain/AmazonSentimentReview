I took one star off for a couple of things. One, some of the commands are overly complex when they could be simplified. For example, I have a Mom Jokes add on, I have to say "Alexa tell Mom Jokes to tell me a Mom Joke". When these should be more integrated where I just say "Alexa tell me a Mom Joke". Half the time I forget what to say to take advantage of the add ons...
