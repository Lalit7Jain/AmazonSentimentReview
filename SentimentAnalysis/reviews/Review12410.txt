I initially didn't jump onto the Echo ship when it came out because I was more attached to Microsoft Cortana assistant, I also wasn't ready to jump into the Amazon Echo system. I finally caved in and got tired of waiting for Microsoft to release their own smart speaker and I wanted to tie all my smart home elements together. I have been amazed by how quickly and accurate Alexa responds, everything is so simple and magic. The speaker portion fills my room and gives the high quality sound I was completely not expecting so it kinda blew me away. Amazon got it right and after seeing what Google home had to offer the choice was clear for me and I have zero regrets and I feel like im becoming drawn into the Amazon eco-system
