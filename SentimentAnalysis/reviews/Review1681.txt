I decided to get myself an Echo as my main Christmas present. It sounded intriguing, if not quite perfected (which isn't at all a problem - with electronic breakthrough devices, it really should always be about incremental changes and improvements - meaning I liked the concept). We don't have connected devices (lights, thermostat, etc), we don't need to use Uber, we like to cook so don't order take out.
