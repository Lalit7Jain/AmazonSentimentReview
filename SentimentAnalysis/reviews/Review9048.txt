2. Home Automation - I rarely use light switches anymore. If you want to feel like you are in the future, get some smart lights and integrate them to Alexa. Being able turn lights on/off, and dim them is awesome. In addition to what Alexa can do, the lights flash if we get texts or calls, so we can silence our phones and still be aware of incoming messages or calls if our phones are not on us.
