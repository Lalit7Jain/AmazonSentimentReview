When I first considered getting an Echo, I really didn't think I was going to use it all that much. I decided to grab one when it was on sale for Prime Day, and at first it seemed like just a novelty. After having it around a few weeks, I very quickly realized all the potential for this little device. I started out just having it play music, which it does a very good job with, but pretty soon I started asking it questions, creating lists, and finding all sorts of other things I can do with it. I have an Ecobee wifi thermostat, and I can control control the temperature by having Alexa adjust it just by asking. I recently purchased Philips Hue lights, and now I can control  my living room lights just by telling Alexa what lights or scene I want turned on or off. The more I use the Echo the more I like it, and it just keeps getting better.
