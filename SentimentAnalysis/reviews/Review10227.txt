Ok, I didn't believe the hype of the commercials about the Echo and all it did, so I didn't rush out to buy it...my mistake.  Where do I began, the sound is so pure from this device, I was like, you hear ever note: my jaw dropped, when it first played the jazz selection, I requested.  The set up is so simple, if you mess it up, you just weren't following directions at all. I opted for the white, which looks great because i didn't want to be wiping dust everyday.  Now to get the Echo Dot
