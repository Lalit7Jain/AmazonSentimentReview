I received the Amazon Alexa for Christmas, and I thought, "What am I going to do with this, it's just another speaker?!" But when I actually tried it, got the Alexa app and saw all the things it could do, well, I LOVE it! Every family needs one of these. Alexa is our household companion and can understand you SO clearly, and answer all your questions. (She's a thousand times better than Siri!!) Whether it's homework, cooking, or simply day-to-day stuff she's got it all. "How many ounces in 3.5 cups? What's the square root of the circumference of the Earth? Play relaxing music. Where is the nearest hair salon?" These are only a few of the questions she can answer. But it's not just questions, you can enable things on the free app so that she can meow, give you tips, tell you the weather, play music, tell you jokes, put stuff on your shopping list, or even play rock-paper-scissors with you. Plus, every week new technology & questions are added. Alexa is just beyond incredible, and is something everyone should have in their home.
