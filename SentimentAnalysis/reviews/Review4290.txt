I got this as a Christmas gift and I couldn't of asked for anything better! I am only 13 but this thing is WONDERFUL because I go to middle school and my hands are always full! With the Echo, I can set my morning alarm, set a reading timer, and even listen to audio books! The ONLY thing that I would change is that you can't really ask it to play music because you have to have some kind of a premium account. Other than that, I would suggest this to EVERYONE! This was the best way to spend $130
