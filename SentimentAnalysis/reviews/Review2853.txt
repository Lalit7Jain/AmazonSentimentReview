Amazon Echo is a cool product.  The voice recognition is impressive, and the design is sleek.  I keep my Echo in my kitchen, and the ability to ask Alexa to read news, or play a particular genre of music is pretty cool.  While I don't find myself using my Echo all that much, it is certainly a great addition to anybody's home, and a product that I would certainly recommend to others.  In my opinion, Amazon has done a great job with their products, and Echo is no exception.  An impressive device, highly recommended!
