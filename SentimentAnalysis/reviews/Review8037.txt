I have a problem with all of the, you have to remember which app to ask to answer the question you have. It would be better if everything was not so compartmentalize. I wish that her software could be updated so once you have enabled a new information source you would then be able to just ask Alexa "how do I get chocolate out of cotton" and she would search for the answer rather than an app. Like a web search, you just type in you question in the search engine and get the answer without have to go to a specific site.
