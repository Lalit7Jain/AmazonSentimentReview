I love the Echo. The quality of the music playback is awesome. The only reason I did not give all stars was I find Alexa often can't answer my questions. But maybe she is still getting used to me. Sometimes you have to rephrase a question and then she gets it. I love her clear voice and her sense of humor. I'm sure I have not seen half of what it can do. Always new things to explore.
