I absolutely love Alexa. I use the "Alexa  play whitenoise" and "Alexa play sounds from nature" commands a lot. It puts the kids to sleep quicker than ever. When they are up, we dance to songs by Kids Bop, Katie Perry and other kid friendly artists. We get news from MPR, and a new buzz word each day for the kids to learn. Buzz words is awesome. It tells the kids a new word, defines it, uses it in a sentence and then quizzes them on it. Alexa even tells my kids bedtime stories about them, using their names! There is also a complimenting skill you can add (for free, all skills are free) where she will give you compliments to your hearts content. The volume is great. I think the best part about it is that skills are still being developed for Alexa and all you have to do is ask "Alexa, what's new?" and she will tell you about her new features.
