Now I dont have to grab my cellphone while cooking or baking, to convert temperatures or set timers, or see what time it is, or convert measurements or even put some music. It is well known that cellphones carry lots and lots of bacteria and is one of the most contaminating sources in a kitchen. All I do is ask Alexa to do all that, while my hands are in the dough or while I am focused on doing something else in my kitchen. I LOVE THIS!
