The Echo is a fun and interesting little gadget. Paired with other items like the Philips Hue system it becomes a cool little command center for your home. But, the products inability to pair with a bluetooth speaker is shocking. So what if it already has a speaker in it? Set it up so when it is paired with a different speaker you can choose which one to use. With all the things the Echo can do it blows my mind that it cannot connect to my Bose speaker. If I had known this was going to be the case I would have paid half as much for a Dot and saved myself the disappointment. Will likely return for a Dot after having waited more than a month to receive the this product as a gift for Christmas.
