This review is difficult to write because, on the whole, I enjoy having the Amazon Echo in our home; however, the fact that the Alexa app (that controls the Echo) is so poor dampens the whole experience.  The Echo itself is amazing!  My favorite features are being able to listen to music by command and the ability to keep a running shopping list the moment I think of something that I need to purchase.  HOWEVER, every time I go the store, the Alexa app won't allow me to pull up the shopping list!  How frustrating! If the Alexa app actually worked, and if the Echo had a few more skills, it would definitely be a five star rating for me!
