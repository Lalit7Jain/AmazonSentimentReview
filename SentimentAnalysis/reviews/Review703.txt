When I bought this device it stopped working within the first couple months. After getting a replacement (refurbished I'm sure) I had even more problems, it would constantly cut out and stop responding. I would have to unplug and re-plug in the echo every 30 minutes and reset it to get it to work. I called back in and they refused to replace the device again. They offered to send me a replacement again at full price. I'm glad so many others were able to enjoy this, but I have never been able to the entire time I've owned it. Switiching to Google home as of today, would not spend another penny on this. All amazon had to do to keep me as a echo customer was to try swapping it out again, too bad.
