The visual design is nice but it just doesn't do 130 dollars' worth of useful stuff.  And I don't really want Susan Rice listening to my dinner-time conversations and unmasking me to MSNBC either.  I wanted to return it but I missed the closing of the return window.  It's not a bad-looking paperweight though.
