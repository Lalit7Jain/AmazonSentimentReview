Obsessed! My entire family loves this device. I am not really a big fan of radio, mostly because I find myself switching stations more than listening to music. With Alexa, I only ask for the music that I want to hear and can skip, repeat, lower or raise volume, etc. and the best part is it's ad free. The fact that I can do that hands free is so helpful, especially in the kitchen. I also have found that I'm not constantly grabbing my phone, to "Google" things. Alexa knows the answers! Looking forward to teaching her new "skills". We've already played "20 Questions" and "The Magic Door" with the kids.
