I really like my White Amazon Echo, it sounds great, it looks great, and it seems to have a really nice solid high quality build with really nice buttons and the top turns with a satisfying amount of resistance. I took down 1 Star because a lot of the questions I ask, it doesn't know the answer to, but I think that will be fixed over time as more and mor epeople use the service. I would definitely would recommend this to a family member or a friend. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!
