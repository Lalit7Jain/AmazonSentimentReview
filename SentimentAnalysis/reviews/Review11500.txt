It's not what I was expecting, I couldn't connect it to my phone and either my tablet, it took my 1 hour by phone with customer service to get it connect and only works on my laptop, it doesn't answer my phone like I read on some reviews, it doesn't response to my commands all the time and when it does I have to be close to it because the volume is really low and I can't hear what it is saying  and if I turn the volume up it will not hear me even if I stand next to it
