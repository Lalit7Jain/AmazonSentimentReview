Great great product. Good sound, and I am particular about the sound. I roll over in bed in the morning and tell Alexa to connect me to my Public Radio station. Nice playing music from Amazon Prime which costs extra. Alexa's jokes are so bad they are good. We use it to control lights in several locations in the house.
