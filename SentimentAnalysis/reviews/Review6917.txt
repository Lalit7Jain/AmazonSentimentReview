Very Disappointed.  First and foremost, It does not control my Fire TV--It should.  It also is very limited in answering questions and getting information.  This device is very rudimentary.  It answers very little questions and lacks capability tom look up all but basic information.  It is very good at playing music.  They need to develop more skills and apps to interface with it.
