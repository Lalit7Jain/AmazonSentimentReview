I also have two Dot's for the bedroom and my office. My only gripes are that the searching feature doesn't seem to be quite as robust as the Google Home, and also that multiple Echo's don't seem to be able to work together yet (such as a Sonos device.) For instance, I'd love to be able to start my flash briefing (which usually runs about 15 minutes) in the bedroom, then transfer it to the kitchen. Or start some music in the office, an then transfer that playlist to the bedroom or something.
