Bought the refurbished version and haven't had any issues. So far, we like the fun skills it has. I use it most frequently for my shopping lists and streaming Spotify. I probably should have purchased the  Dot to hook up to my existing sound system because the Echo speaker is alright for casual listening, but it's not amazing. Overall, it's a useful tool in my house even though we don't use it nearly to its maximum capabilities
