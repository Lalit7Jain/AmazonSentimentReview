Alexa is great....she plays music for me in the kitchen....can pick out Pandora play lists, Amazon play lists, provides weather updates, and other such things that are handy to have at the fingertips.  I really like the shopping & to do list functions that mesh with smart phone app.  Highly recommended for home or office...very stylish and elegant looking.
