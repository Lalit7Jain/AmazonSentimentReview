On a serious note Alexa does understand both my husband and son while they pause mid sentence, where her friend Siri does not. Alexa just keeps listening like a good friend, while they pause for dramatic effect. My husband has a lisp, that is not present unless tired, thanks to years of speech therapy as a kid. Alexa does understand him even when he lisps. She also understand when he ends a sentence with a preposition. So she gets five stars for language.
