At first just an expensive toy but now I'm finding the Echo to be an alternative to going to the internet on phone to search everything. Super easy to set up and use. I paired it with my iPhone and can stream music easily. Sound is great! Wish you could pick your own name as Garth Brooks commercial always turns it on!!!
