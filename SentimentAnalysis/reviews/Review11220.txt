We absolutely LOVE our Alexa! Alexa has made such a difference in our home...she keeps tract of my calendar, helps the kids with homework,keeps up with my shopping list, adjusts our AC thermostat, plays music, and so, so much more. The app is great too! I can turn Alexa on remotely with the app and when I'm at the grocery store I can pull up the app to see what's on my list.
