A couple minor issues have been noted by us so far.  First, if it is playing music at max volume, it was not able to here us screaming Alexa at it.  We had to get up and manually turn the volume down.  Second, it was not able to recognize our Lutron Caseta hub until I moved it closer to the hub location.  Finally, I really wish it had the ability to transmit our via Bluetooth.  This would allow you to stream music to a Bluetooth enabled speaker or receiver for greater flexibility and sound quality.
