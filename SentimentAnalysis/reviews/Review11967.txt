Working from home, this has become an indispensable part of my life and I am only scratching the surface of all that ECHO can do.  The sound of the music is excellent and being able to access the Amazon library for music leaves me unlimited choices.  I also like to play the NPR news along with weather.  As time goes on, I am sure that I will find many other uses for this device.  It is hard to believe that this sounds as good as my old 1970s stereo used to.  Love it.
