Maybe I'm not using Alexa correctly, but I hope it gets better in the future. Otherwise it's just a really expensive mediocre attempt at voice-controlled tech that I'm not super impressed with. If Amazon and Google work together to improve the voice recognition or the search features I'm sure this product would be awesome. I'll keep her for now.
