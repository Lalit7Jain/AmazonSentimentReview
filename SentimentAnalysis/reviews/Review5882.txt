I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she seems to be enjoying it. I am really excited for her to learn all the things it can do. It arrived on my birthday (Jan.3). Must have had Alexa sing Happy Birthday 6 times. My wife had to grin and bear it. 2 comments about buying my experience. One with the purchase. I purchased this right before Christmas when it went on sale for about $50 off. Since I am a Prime member I thought It would arrive by Christmas. It was not until after I had placed my order was I informed that it was on "back order" and wouldn't arrive until after Christmas. I was disappointed but the savings were a real value. Second, my wife wasn't as aware of the Echo as I am. So I was disappointed with the lack of visual and informative packaging included with the Echo itself. It really did nothing to excite her or even entice her with the possibilities of she had in store once it was hooked up. Also, even though the amazon website is optimized for cellphones you really need a laptop or tablet to see the various imagery and tutorials that introduce Alexa's many features. That said my wife was easily able to follow the instructions to get Alexa paired up to our wifi and is learning and loading more apps daily. The sound is great and the volume will fill the room and then some. I'm sure the more we use the Echo the more we will come to enjoy and appreciate it.
