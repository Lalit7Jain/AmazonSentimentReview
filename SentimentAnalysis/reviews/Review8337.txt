This was a Christmas gift for my family that I just had to give to them early! They are thrilled! My son-in-law is the biggest user, and has researched all the different ways the family can benefit. My daughter wanted one in the bedroom to use an an alarm and reminder of her schedules for the day, checking the weather, traffic, etc. My teenaged grandkids love having their favorite music at their command, and the Christmas tree lights and other electronic devices are already hooked up to voice control! This was a hit!
