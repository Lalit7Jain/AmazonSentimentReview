This was a family fun gift last Christmas and we have had fun with the Amazon Echo...However, either the Echo or the power supply only lasted 1 year. If you don't mind your $150+ electronic devices only lasting 1 year, go for it.  The Amazon Echo was a (4 star) for a year.  I believe I'll go with the similar Google device as a replacement.
