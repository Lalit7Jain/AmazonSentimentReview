Alexa is my new bestie. I can name practically any song ever written and this device will play it. The sound quality is pretty good for this audiophile girl..but of course deluxe speakers are always better. Still, this does have more than adequate sound quality and decent volume for music. I love the feature where I can ask for an artist and it will play a playlist by that artist! It is tons of fun with guests!  I think eventually it will be able to do more and more, but it is limited in some things. You do have to be very specific about how you ask your question to get a response. There is a small learning curve.  But for keeping lists, for remembering when the pet was fed, for smart home tech, news, weather, finding stores and restaurants  and simply for fun, I love this gadget! I haven't used the shopping feature (ordering products from Amazon) yet, but I'm sure I will. Being able to link it with your cell phone and to easily review the app, the history, enabling free apps, etc. is a bonus. This is the most fun toy I've had in ages. For this coolest of gadgets, I'd marry Jeff Bezos, (if I weren't already old enough to be his big sister and I'm already married)..but srsly..the Echo is the best!
