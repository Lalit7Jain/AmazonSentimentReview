After getting the Dot (Gen 2) I decided to get this to use in my kitchen, and so far its has been one of the best gadgets for our home, Alexa takes some time to learn what to say but the Skills are really making this gadget better all the time, I have a Harmony Hub, Insteon devices, Isy994i, and Blue Iris connected to the Echo and my Dot. I see great potential here and our kid really likes talking to it, We have an African Grey Parrot so were interested to see what happens. The Insteon with the ISY Portal works good and makes it easy to control equipment since you are not limited to buttons on a remote, Blue Iris worked good and I was able to connect it after several tries
