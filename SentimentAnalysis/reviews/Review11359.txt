We bought this as a gift to ourselves. It is the coolest device we own and it's transformed our daily lives. We have small children and I always wanted them to grow up with an appreciation of different types of music. The Echo makes it possible for us to play anything we want at any given moment. When the baby is growing impatient while we're cleaning up after dinner, we throw on some Beach Boys. When our five-year-old wants to be silly, we play Monster Mash. When we need to calm down and enjoy dinner, we switch to the Jazz channel. We now have two children (a one-year-old and a five-year-old), who are surrounded by music and have turned into dancing fools...and we love it. Granted, it would be nice if Alexa had the ability to deny my daughter's request to play the same song eight times in a row, but we'll survive.
