Good product, but is lacking tons of information. If you don know the exact way to ask a question you will get no response and the 'skills' section is lacking....but the bright side is that I'm sure the skills will continue to be added and grow, so over all its a cool "toy" for now, but hopefully wil turn into a great "tool". I would also suggest keeping it ON MUTE since it collects all of your spoken words in Amazons database. To me privacy is becoming more and more of an issue in the products we buy (not even sure if keeping it on mute will prevent it from storing sounds at all) buy the remote and keep it on mute and only tell it what you want it to hear.
