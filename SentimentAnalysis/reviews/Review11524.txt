I know this product can do so much more than what I use it for. Nevertheless, I love it. I have a few problems with connections a few times and it took a few tries to get it working again, but overall Amazon has done a great job with this device. I primarily use my Echo for listen to radio and music.  The music sound is amazing for such a cylindrical device!  I have tried a few things Amazon recommends and I am having fun with it!
