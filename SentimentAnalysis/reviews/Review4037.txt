I have for two days to connect to my wireless router with no luck. It says you can set up with browse but the problem is after days trying to the echo no luck because I never get the Alexa app. I connect to Echo and it say finish set the app on your laptop. I don't have a lap top. I can connect to the wireless with my computer and other devices, But because of no Alexa app I cannot enter a pass word which my wireless router requires. I called Amazon and was first told it only worked on laptops. I knew that should be wrong and asked for a manager. Who told me I had to have internet connection through wireless. I disconnect the cable to my router and disabled adapter. Nothing changed still no Alexa app.Once I connect to the Echo network it times out because I cannot enter the router pass word
