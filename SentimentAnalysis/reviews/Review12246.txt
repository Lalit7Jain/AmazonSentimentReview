I purchased the Echo for my main level  and a dot for lower level. I like both very much especially combined with Phillips Hue bulbs.  I call Echo by the name "Echo" and the dot responds to "Alexa".  Sometimes Echo responds when her name is not stated.  A few days ago I was telling my husband about the television ad in which the parrot says "Alexa, order crackers, and Alexa says "O.K."  I happened to check my Amazon account  to find out when an item I had ordered previously was to arrive, and to my great surprise, Dot Alexa had order me crackers! Allow me to remind you, my Dot is in my lower level and I was one floor above it's location!  I was able to cancel the crackers order and turned off ordering from my Echo and Dot.
