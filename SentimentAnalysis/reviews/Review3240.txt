To be fair, Alexa isn't perfect.  There is a learning curve on how to phrase things to get the answer you want.  For example, if you ask "What time does the University of Michigan play basketball today?" she'll tell you she doesn't know.  But if you say "What time is the Michigan Wolverines basketball game?" she'll say "The Michigan Wolverines play Ohio State University at 7pm".  I've found phrasing to be important with many questions I ask, but especially with sports questions.  Sometimes it takes a few tries but you can usually get the answer you want.
