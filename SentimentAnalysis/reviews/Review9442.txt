Well, that was easy... My niece loves her Echo, so when it went on sale I grabbed it. So glad I did. Even my husband, who is techno-averse, loves it. The only problem is that when he asks me if I "think Alexa can do xxx", Alexa thinks he's asking her a question and keeps apologizing. Not a bad problem to have, actually. Aside from feeling like we should rename her "Hal", no regrets.
