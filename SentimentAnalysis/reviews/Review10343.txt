Like many things that are being sold as finished products these days, she is a work in progress. You spend half the time arguing with her and calling her names while you find a more traditional solution to your issues. I still use her, to turn off and on lights, I still use her for timers (although half the time I just use the microwave as you cannot tell if a timer is set or how much time is left without asking her, and some simple conversions and math shes okay with. I also use the shopping list app. Although, it MUST have a internet connection so if you are in a store with a bad connection (which is almost every store in my case), no shopping list for you!  Its near impossible to navigate Pandora stations or anything like that with her. Just know what you want before you ask her because you cant browse obviously. Like I said above, the apps fail half the time and the ones that do work are appsolutely rubbish.
