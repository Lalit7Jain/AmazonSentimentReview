We received the Amazon Echo from my children as a Christmas present. We had our celebration early. I have spent the last three days trying to sync my Apple calendar to the Google calendar so that I can use my calendar with Echo. The concept is a great idea. I was really looking forward to it. It has been a nightmare to say the least!!! I first had to set up a gmail account. I didn't have one. Then I watched numerous Youtube programs to see just how to do it. Then I began to sync my first category. It went over as a url. I haven't figured out how to rename the url. I now have duplicates from google on my i calendar that I am having trouble getting rid of.  I understand Apple is coming out with their own gadget like the Echo. I think Amazon needs to tell Echo purchasers that it is not easily compatible with the Apple calendar. I still do not have the calendars synced. It is a mess. I am extremely disappointed.
