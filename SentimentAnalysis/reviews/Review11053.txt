Expected more.  Purchased Alexa primarily for music, and didn't realize that you would have to pay for a relatively expensive monthly service through Amazon to stream music, or a different Amazon service to upload CD's I've already purchased through iTunes.  Alexa doesn't understand many of my requests, even for music I own and have uploaded to one of these services.  At this point, it's used only to shuffle music I own, or entertainment for our young kids who like to ask it questions, as anything more demanding is too much for its capabilities.
