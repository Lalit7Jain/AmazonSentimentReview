My husband gave me an Amazon Echo for Christmas nine days ago. It will not connect to our wifi. I'm a very computer-savvy person, but every trouble-shooting step suggested by Amazon has failed. Once or twice "Alexa" has actually announced that she's connected, but then disconnects or says she cannot understand me and to try later. I called Echo support, and spoke to someone whose English was barely intelligible (I'm also a language teacher and am very experienced and patient with non-native English speakers.) The Alexa app on my iPad freezes on the Intro Video page. Everything about my Echo experience has been a nightmare; I'm ready to ship it back.
