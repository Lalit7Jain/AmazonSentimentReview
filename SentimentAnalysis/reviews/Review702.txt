The Echo doesn't need my voice added the chorus, but here it is anyway! It's a great product that can be used in so many ways. I primarily use it for the grocery list and music, and even those two features alone make it worth the money. Having recently moved, I'll be syncing it to some other smart features in my new home, like my thermostat and my window a/c - I'm excited to really unlock the full potential.
