I should have purchased this when I received my invitation, oh well I still got in on sale. Most of you already know what an Alexa or Echo is so I'll try to spare some of the redundancy. The Echo is a great companion to anyone who wants information, news, sports scores, music, smart home capabilities (that's gonna cost you), and even pizza delivered by the sound of your voice.
