I bought this a year ago. I cannot believe how much I use it. It is great for listening to music and getting weather and news updates. I keep it near the kitchen area and the timer feature is my favorite. My son loves the random fact and joke features. We use it to play music daily. We have recommended it to all of our friends, who now have one too. My only complaint is that none of the features work without an internet connection, which is understandable. If the alarm and timer features would be enabled offline, I would definitely give it five stars rather than four.
