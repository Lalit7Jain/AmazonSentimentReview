At first, I thought this was a frivolous purchase. But it is so much more than that. I take a ton of pills each day. I get involved with other things and I forget to take them. Not since I set an alarm on the Echo! Haven't missed one pill since Alexa moved in. I think it is especially well suited for seniors. It's comforting to be able to chat with Alexa, to play games, stay in touch with the outside world. And the speakers are excellent. I find myself playing music much more frequently than pre-Alexa. The Echo went quickly from frivolous to essential.
