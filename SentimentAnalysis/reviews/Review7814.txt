I don't care about the talking feature for jokes, weather, or other internet info.. because I have 3 other devices that do that.  So that leaves it being a wireless speaker capable of doing some voice commands. and in those terms the sound from it is exactly what you would expect from a small bluetooth portable speaker.  Meh.
