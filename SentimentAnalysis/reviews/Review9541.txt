The setup of the device was easy. It is a great replacement to my old clock radio and user to on and off my hue lights on command. The same applies to the fact finding questions to ask Alexa on my subway schedule, Bloomberg market minutes, BBC radio, general celeb questions, weather, Amazon music choices, etc. No complaints. It was worth the cost.
