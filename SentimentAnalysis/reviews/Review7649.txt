My echo appears to be broken right out of the box as it doesn't do anything useful. Everyone is already intertwined into an apple or Google ecosystem and this s*** cylinder doesn't interact with either. It doesn't even interact with other Amazon devices.  Pathetic.  Don't waste your money. And if you tell people this thing is useful, your lying to them as well as yourself.
