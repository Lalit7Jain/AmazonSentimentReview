I will say, I've been an excellent parent!  She's got her protective sleeve (jacket), along with a hard case (car seat) for travel.  All purchased from Amazon (of course).  Unfortunately, she's cursed to only wear muumuus,(because I'm from Hawaii, and she doesn't have hips) and homemade clothing(my husband is from Virginia Mountain Country, and he crochets)  She's been welcomed by our other children as well.
