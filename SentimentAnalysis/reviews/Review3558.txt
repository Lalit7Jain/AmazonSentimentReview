So I have a functional Echo, but can't get to settings to finish setting it up, add skills, or see what it can do.  Amazon, you have a few days to correct this before I have to decide whether I keep the Google Home or send the Echo back.  It's a pity, because the Echo's sound quality is better than the Home.
