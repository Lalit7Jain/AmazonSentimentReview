So as it stands, I want to give this product more time, but if more apps and functionality aren't added, I would have to say avoid.  If you're an Apple/iPhone user, I'm not sure.  If Siri really is as bad as those horror stories, give it a whirl.  If nothing else, you'll have an awesome radio/personal assistant.  If you're locked into the PC/Android world like I am, you pretty much have everything this product does.  A $10 microphone will get about 90% of the functionality of this device.  Your phone also will have most of functionality of this device. However, the thing is light and somewhat mobile (wish it had a battery), unlike a PC.  My review would instantly bump to 4 stars if I received a $100 gift card and the priced dropped to $90, but at $189 it's just too expensive.
