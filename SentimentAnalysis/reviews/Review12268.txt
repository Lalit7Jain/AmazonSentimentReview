I purchased my Echo primary as a bluetooth-enabled speaker and I am very satisfied with the sound quality demonstrated by this product.  The voice control feature is great for playing music.  Honestly, I was not expecting to utilize the additional features of the Echo as much as I do but with new skills being released every day, the utility and entertainment of this product has truly exceeded my expectations.  I love this product and I use it daily.  I have not had any connectivity issues or any problems with my device so far.  Great job Amazon!
