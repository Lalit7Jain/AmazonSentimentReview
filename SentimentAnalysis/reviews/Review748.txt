I was an early adopter, and purchased my Echo when they first became available to Prime members in early 2015. Unfortunately, my Echo intermittently stopped producing any sound about a year after I bought it. The only way to get it working again was to unplug it for a while, then plug it back in. I went through a few rounds of troubleshooting with Amazon's Echo tech support, to no avail. Since it was out of warranty, their only "solution" was to offer to sell me a new Echo for $20 more than I paid for the original one. Hardly a satisfactory solution in my opinion.
