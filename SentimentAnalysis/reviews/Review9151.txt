I am always listening to music so I use this all the time. My kids love to ask Alexa to tell them jokes. I also use the timer feature quite often. I have not had much problems with it understanding me, but it is fairly new. There are a lot of apps that you can add that increase its functionality. I do think that the shopping list could be improved, I wish you could add quantity and more items at a time. If there is a way to do that, I have not figured it out yet. I also like to be able to ask random questions, this helps with homework time. All in all, I love it!
