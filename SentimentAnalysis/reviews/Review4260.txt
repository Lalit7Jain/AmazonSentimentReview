I bought this shortly before Christmas and it's taking me some time to get used to using it. It's not natural to talk to the Echo but once you get the hang of it, it's fun and it's so very useful. I now have this *and* a dot and am considering a second dot for the kitchen. I use the echo to update my grocery list (Alexa, add milk to my shopping list) -- this is by far, my most used skill. I also use the dot in the bedroom to wake me in the morning (Alexa, set alarm for 4:45am) and with a subtle pulsing light and light music, it wakes me every morning. It provides me with the morning 'flash' a run-down of curated headlines from my local news, NPR, fox sports and the WSJ. We enjoy playing jeopardy with the Echo and Alexa has a sense of humor. After hearing me say "Alexa, add this to the shopping list, Alexa add that to the shopping list" my husband asked "Alexa kiss my butt" and guess what...she responded :) If you are a Prime member, it will play tons of music too. I've been having a blast with this and am looking forward to adding an Echo enabled outlet to control lamps while I am away.
