This is perfect if you are using it a lot for music.  But if you are primarily using it for anything else or need lots of volume, seriously look at the Echo Dot.  I have a really nice bluetooth speaker that I connect to the dot when I need additional volume.  If you are routinely using for music, using an external speaker and constantly pairing it to power it up would not be practical, so this is the unit you would want.  I would recommend this to any of my music loving friends who would use it as their primary sound source.
