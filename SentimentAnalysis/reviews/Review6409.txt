We've tossed ours in a box and threw it in the attic. The black device we call alexa cant understand the simplest of commands. Its frustrating to have to say things in such unnatural ways to get an action from here. Seriously, who in the heck wants to say "Alexa, set the Nest thermostat to 70 degree"? No, its natural to say set the temp to 70 and be done! Complete waste of money!
