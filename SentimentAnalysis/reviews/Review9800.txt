Updated. After a highly critical review of the Alexa, I went to "my Account" to find the Dot that I'd recently purchased so that I could blast that as well.  While there I stumbled upon the solution. My issue was the Shopping List function -- probably the most 'productive' function apparent inability to quickly and easily clear the shopping list. Neither the Alexa App (iOS) and PC browser (alexa.amazon.com) are to display a Select All in order to then delete all.  Without this, clearing a shopping list (of say 50 items) required nearly 60 clicks or taps.  I spoke with Amazon Customer Service and they 'confirmed' that the instructions were wrong and that the function was missing.  It *is* missing from the App and the Alexa.amazon.com web site, but logging onto your amazon account, the Drop-down (Accounts & Lists) offers a Shopping List with the missing Select All.
