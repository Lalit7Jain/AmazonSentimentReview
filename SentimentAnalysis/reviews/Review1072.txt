I had a friend show me his Echo, and I decided to purchase one. I bought a Certified Refurbished one, and have had to reset it a couple of times.  I hope this is not a recurring problem.  When it works, it's pretty cool. I like the broad music selection. The speakers sound pretty good, for such a small enclosure. I'm sure I've barely scraped the tip of the iceberg, as far as the Echo's capabilities, and I look forward to continuing to use it more and more.
