Unlike the Echo Dot, the echo won't pair with speakers or receiver.  Everyone says the sound from the Echo is so good it's not necessary, but those with hearing disabilities and minimal hearing in the high range it sounds way too base.  It would be nice to be able to send the sound through a receiver and adjust the equalizer, but not possible with this device.  Son-in-law had the Echo Dot and hooked it up through receiver and i was amazed.  He bought me this one for Christmas and I was very disappointed that it would not work through receiver.
