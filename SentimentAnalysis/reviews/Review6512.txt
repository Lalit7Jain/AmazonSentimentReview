Great product overall, but I have yet to find a setting that allows me to block explicit content.  I'm just looking for the standard radio version of songs.  When my kids ask Alexa to play music that they have been used to hearing on the Disney Channel like All About That Bass, they get the version with the lines "you know this sh*t ain't real" and "skinny b*tches".  Really?  I can't block this.  Listeners should be given a choice.  Big problem.  For now, I'm just making them listen to KidzBop.
