Nice gadget. Plays a bunch of music. Live sounding woman's voice.  Has some research capability. However needs available additional apps in order to incorporate features. Would be nice a incentive to purchase this item if Amazon included a years worth of Prime music service with the purchase of echo. Also, maybe a selection of voices too.
