Things that I found useful and work quite well, ordering things I buy on a regular on Amazon works great. I keep it in my kitchen and order coffee when it runs out. For the most part I have found after the initial novelty of it wore off, I only use it for a few things, ordering things, listening to music, and listening to audible books. Good for shopping list too, if you use an app that works with it.
