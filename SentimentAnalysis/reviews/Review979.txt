I love my Amazon echo. We got ours this past Christmas and then added a couple dots. It's sort of like potato chips, you can't have just one. Actually one would've been just fine but I like having the extra coverage. I use it every day for all sorts of things including playing trivia games to music, to turning my space heater on at night so I don't have to get up out of bed, ( this does require an additional purchase of a special plug),  to spell a word or give a definition of a word, to get the news and the weather to add things to a shopping list. That one is really convenient. Anytime you happen to think of something you can just call out please add this to the shopping list and you don't have to write it down. I also use it for alarms and timers. And then there are the fun things like when you say good morning she gives you an interesting fact about the day or something. Don't forget jokes, she tells jokes. So I definitely got my moneys worth. I will say that my spouse tends to use it only for music and timers and doesn't do as much with it as I do, but she wouldn't trade it for anything either.
