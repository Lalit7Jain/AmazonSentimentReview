If I had the time and money I'm sure this would be a great product. As it is this thing doesn't do anything useful for me. Control my TV? Nope just turn it on and off. Play music? Only if you have the right service and the options are limited. Control my lights? Yea if I go spend 100 dollars replacing all my light switches with the few options that work with Alexa.
