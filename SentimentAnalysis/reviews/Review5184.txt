I haven't hooked this up to any smart devices in my home yet, but I like that I have the ability to do so. My daughter has also enjoyed asking Alexa to tell her jokes (and thankfully hasn't discovered the ability to order anything from it yet!). I'm able to quickly find out the weather forecast, listen to music, get recipes, etc. I received it as a Christmas gift and would definitely recommend it.
