I use Echo daily to check weather, traffic, my daily schedule, shopping and to do list.  Being 72 and living alone, my daughter has encouraged me to get one of those alert devices.  I was able to set up emergency alerts to family members, should the need arise, at no additional cost!  I love that I can ask for music, a joke or to play a game.  With Christmas coming,  this would be a wonderful family gift!
