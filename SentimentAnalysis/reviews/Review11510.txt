Oh Alexa, how we love you. We bought you a pretty red skin from DecalGirl.com and added some googly eyes from the craft store. We were early adopters, on the first flight out of Dodge. We argued with you and you told us jokes. We asked for restaurant recommendations and you sent us to dives. But we loved you. Then, on a rainy October evening, I asked you to play "Poke Salit Annie" and, to my surprise, you replied "Echo cannot connect to your internet..."...WHAT?!?!
