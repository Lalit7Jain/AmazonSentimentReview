Using a brand-spanking new iPhone 7 (with latest sw upgrades), downloaded the Amazon Echo app from the Apple App store, and attempted an install. After prompt for Amazon username, and password, and a prompt to allow Echo to send prompts, I simply get a spinning wheel (and the Amazon Echo logo). Tried every workaround Amazon's posted (reset phone, kill app, delete and reinstall app, etc. to no avail. Next step is to try to reach Amazon tech support for assistance. This is a huge bummer, as it was a present for my wife. She's less than amused, and we're very close to a return. No wonder the app only has "2" stars on the site. We haven't even gotten to the "slowness of the app" part, as it won't install.
