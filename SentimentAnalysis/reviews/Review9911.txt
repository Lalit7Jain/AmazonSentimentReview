If you want to listen to the radio, their scheduling is all mixed up.  My program is broadcast on numerous stations across the country.  If you are lucky and it finds the program in progress, it often drops it half-way through and begins a different program.  Most of the time I have to put my radio on to get the program I desire, as it says it has found the program, but it broadcasts an entirely different program.  Extremely frustrating...especially if you are right in the middle of listening to an interview and it starts playing a music station!  You can repeatedly request that it play the program, and it continues to bring up a channel that is playing music.
