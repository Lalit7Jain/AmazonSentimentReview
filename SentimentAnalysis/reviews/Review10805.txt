First, I don't understand the people who write reviews and leave a few stars off for features that knew were not available when they bought it. Read the reviews, descriptions and questions before you buy. I love my Echo, which I purchased on Alexa's second birthday. I had been on the fence, but after seeing everything my Echo can do, I'm sold for life. If you live alone, Alexa is a wonderful companion. The sound is awesome, and I've been spoiled by Bose sound systems, so if you are a music lover, I think you will be pleased with the sound and the variety available from Amazon Music for 3.99 per device, or 7.99 unlimited.  I play Jeopardy, trivia, set alarms, timers, listen to the news and weather and a lot more on my Echo. I'm so thrilled with the Echo, I'm contemplating buying another one or an Amazon Tap to take with me. I also ordered the Phillips Hue package as an AlexaDeal, so be sure to ask her what her deals are, you can get some nice discounts.
