In general, I like the Echo. I like the features it already has, and the additional skills you can download. But being highly technical, I can see that realistically, this device is still only a small step toward a truly intelligent interactive household management system. There are far more areas that need improvement than those I've listed here. Thankfully, the greatest feature of the Echo is the fact that it can be updated with new features as time progresses. Knowing this gives all of us hope that the current shortcomings will disappear over time.
