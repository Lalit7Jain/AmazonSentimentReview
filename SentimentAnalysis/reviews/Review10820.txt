While that is a possibility, the Echo still has many things to be desired, and is still a long way from a necessity.  I think I would have trouble convincing my parents and other less tech savvy people that the Echo is for them and it's hard for a regular person to get excited about it's potential usefulness, but for the money, you at least get a really nice speaker you can play music on.
