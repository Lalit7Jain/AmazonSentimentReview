I have been in the home Automation Industry for 30 years and get to play with ultra cool things all day long so it takes a lot to get me excited about most products as so many disappoint. I have to say I was a little skeptical about this unit when I purchased it as I have dealt with Siri for years and absolutely hate her as she rarely works so my expectation levels for anything with voice commands was going to be low. Well I tell you that is not the case with the Echo unit as it works unbelievably great as far as voice recognition goes and the abilities to do simple things like getting the weather and the news or turning on a internet radio station is a breeze. I would say that Alexa ( The devices name )  works to do the task you ask about 85-90 percent of the time whereas Siri does maybe 25 percent at best, in addition Alexa is just a better name as well:) . I operate a Home Automation company and I can see us putting these to great use in our clients homes to control all the devices in their homes by voice as well as remotes or iOS devices.
