The Amazon Echo was the must have gadget of the season, but is it really worth it? I got it and expected something far cooler than a large white cylinder that understands you 10% of the time. The device is really just a glorified Bluetooth speaker. I advise that you really look at what you want and find out if there are better products that do just that. If you want something to control your home, this is not it. If you want a novelty item that isn't worth its price tag, this is your device. Amazon has a way to go on this product, and its time is just not right now. Amazon may have a good idea, but its all hype but no substance.
