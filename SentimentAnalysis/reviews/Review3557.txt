Wow Amazon, I am so disappointed.  I bought an Echo to compare to a recently-purchased Google Home.  The Home's setup took literally less than 2 minutes and went flawlessly.  The Echo wouldn't set up, the app kept going back to the connection screen.  After far too much time exploring answers on Google I got it connected before opening the app.  So the Echo responded to Alexa and worked as expected, but the iOS app on my iPhone and iPad keeps going back to the "Begin Setup" screens and loops through that over and over.  I finally called Amazon and was told that their Alexa app doesn't work with the new version of iOS released a week and half ago.  I tried to go to alexa.amazon.com on both Safari and Chrome and get the same screen as the app.
