I LOVE my Amazon Echo. I bought one for our house, then bought them as gifts for two family members. In addition, I purchased a first generation Echo Dot for my bedroom. When I saw the new Echo Dot, I ordered one of those to replace the one in my bedroom. I was very excited because I was going to bring my first generation Dot to use in my classroom. Today, I tried to set up the Dot at school and was saddened to discover that I cannot set it up on our network because it does not support WPA2 Enterprise. I did some searching online and found that many people are not able to use their Echos at their work locations for the same reason. I love this product so much and would think that Amazon would encourage customers to purchase these for work and home locations. It would be GREAT to use in the classroom. Please fix this, Amazon!
