Since setting it up last night, the Echo has had an array of problems. The initial setup froze halfway through, and it took a few attempts to actually get it hooked up through wifi (what a clunky approach, piggybacking the phone connection). After that, it seemed to work decently. Alexa still has major problems understanding some basic words, and I have frequent trouble having the Echo locate albums that are already in my music library. For a catalog that supposedly has "tens of millions" of songs, I sure can't seem to find basic stuff. Say "Alexa, play music by Bach" and you get... wait for it... one song by George Winston and J.S. Bach. Ask for a Bach playlist and there's nothing. Look something up manually on Amazon Music to verify it's there and then ask Alexa for it, let's say "Bach: Unaccompanied Cello Suites," and she plays just the first track. Where's the rest of the album? What good is having a voice interface in the first place, if you have to look everything up on the website and then practice asking for it in various, precisely detailed ways until the Echo gets it right? There's got to be a better way to organize the music collection to fetch by voice. This is currently a major limitation.
