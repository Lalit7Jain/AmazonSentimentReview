Fun, easy to set-up and use.  Some problems with voice recognition even after completing the voice set-up drills.  Skills info and tricks of the trade for using the basic apps are not included with the instructions (how much info can they fit on a 3x3 inch card?, but lots of info is available at the Amazon site, and from email updates received direct from Amazon.  We purchased two separate, highly-rated paperback books to help familiarize ourselves with skills and commands.  The variety of home automation products for use with the Echo are many...most appear to have sensitive set-up issues or infant mortality concerns (with poor support comments from users).  Wish Amazon would market its' own line of endorsed home automation accessories for the Echo that support simple plug and play end-user installation.  We also purchased the Amazon Echo remote separately...makes the Echo must more versatile.  Just wish we could select a different/custom wake-up name other than the limited three..."H.A.L." would be cool!  Weatherbug
