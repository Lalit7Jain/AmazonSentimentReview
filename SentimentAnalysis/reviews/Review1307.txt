We spent over three hours trying to get our Echo to connect to our wi-fi network and register it with Amazon.  Apparently some people get lucky, but we finally gave up.  The instructions are not adequate and you should not have to search the internet for clues like a Pokemon Go player when setting up a device like this.  If it doesn't connect right away you are screwed.  We threw ours in the trash since we didn't think it should go in any of the recycling bins.
