I just got Echo/Alexa and other than playing music and being mildly entertaining, she's a stupid sack o' electronics. I downloaded the Samsung app to no avail..... I have all Samsung (newer) Smart TVs, all are wifi enabled, all have the option of being a hub, and Alexa can't find any of them, nor can I find much info online.  The 3 page book that comes with her is not at all helpful.  Samsung, we have the TVs, that SEEM to have the technology, get on the bandwagon and add the app in!!!  I have to say the speaker sounds good, I saw complaints about that and I'm pleased with it, and she can be funny, but the lack of connecting ANYTHING at this point makes her pretty useless.....
