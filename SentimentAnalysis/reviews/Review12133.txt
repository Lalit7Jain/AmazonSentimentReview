We Just built a new home and I had grand plans of an entire home wired and integrated with mind blowing sound and interconnected in every room. Real state of the art stuff.  Then I remembered I had 2 young kids a wife and a budget that is limited by reality unlike my inner childlike self with an addiction to everything tech.
