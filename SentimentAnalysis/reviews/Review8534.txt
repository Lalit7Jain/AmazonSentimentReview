I love my Echo! I do wish I could listen to classical composers by name, though. When I ask her for music by JS Bach she plays souped-up Bach, for instance by George Winston, nice, but not what I was hoping for. I know I can upload my ITunes classical playlist and she will play from that, but I am allowed only a certain amount of "space" in the Amazon Music Cloud. My classical playlist is huge!
