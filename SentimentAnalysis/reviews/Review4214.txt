We like our Echo, but I don't think we're using "her" to full advantage. I definitely ask her the weather every morning and use her "timer" feature for cooking and doing the laundry. My husband has asked her how to spell things and we tried asking her to play music, but that's where it got confusing, The only way I can get her to play "my" music is by going on my phone to the Alexa App, and choosing music there, and then the music on the Echo will start to play. But if I asked the Echo "Alexa - play some Christmas music", she answered "I'm sorry, I can't seem to find any Christmas music", even though I had added Christmas music to my Amazon Prime music list. So I'm not clear on how the music feature is supposed to work.  I still haven't taken the time to have her play games with me. My husband has asked her for game scores, though. And we don't have any "smart" appliances, so we can't taken advantage of that feature. So right now, she's kind of an expensive weather report & timer.
