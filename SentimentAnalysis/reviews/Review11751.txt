It only turns on your music right? What else is good for? Please tell me! I do research on large purchase items but this thing just was ok - meh. I can see using it as some users do that are disabled, etc. but I don't need that kind of assistance (hopefully never will) but please tell what else Alexa can do besides play music and answer questions that Google can. I returned mine.
