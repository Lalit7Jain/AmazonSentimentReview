This item for music or a bluetooth for youtube great.  I was only able to hook up  one smart device, my thermostat.  Tried other items that stated they worked with echo no luck.  I contacted amazon they seemed to want to help but told me nicely,  they the person I talk to,  could not help me now I have a $30.00 light bulb.  I've had it for 8 months even bought one for my mother.  We barely use it when I do It's  like pulling teeth.  I have tried several times to do more with by followed the instruction on the app and form amazon. It could be my device is faulty.  If you do get it try as much as  you can to  find out if it will fit your needs.
