The box was damaged. Looked like an old box was used. This is supposed to be a birthday gift for my son, embarrasing to say the least. I hope the echo isn't damaged also. I will get back with update on whether or not the device works. Right now i am not happy. Giving 3 stars because i am not sure if the device works.
