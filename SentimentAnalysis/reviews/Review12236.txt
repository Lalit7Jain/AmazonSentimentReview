I like it a lot, but it needs to improve and it would be rather easy to do. The Timers come with some sounds and a few Celebrity voice that say a few things like Wake Up Sunshine, and other Words.  It would be GREAT if Amazon could add another Category, of common reminders, or allow users to record they own words.
