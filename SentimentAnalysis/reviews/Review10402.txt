It's nice being able to control things with just a voice command, but many times I'm wishing for a screen to see things on, which is where the Alexa App comes in, but I find the app to be lacking, it's not as sleek and user friendly or feature rich as I want.  For instance you can't delete all history at once and it will save every command you ask it.  So if you asked it something you didn't want anyone else to know you asked, you have to go in and find the certain request and manually delete it.
