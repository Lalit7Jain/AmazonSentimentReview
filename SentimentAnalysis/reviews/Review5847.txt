I can't begin to tell you what a difference the echo has made to my disabled veteran husband. After his stroke, his mobility and speech were effected. giving him a whisper of a voice. He can now ask Alexa to play any song of his choosing without having to get up . And she recognizes his whisper of a voice. Can't wait to hook Alexa up to the household lights so my husband will have an easier time turning them on.
