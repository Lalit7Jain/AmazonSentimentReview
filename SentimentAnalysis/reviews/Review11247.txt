Not worth the money sound is OK at low volume but will not pickup Voice commands. Specific song requests will not be allowed unless you purchase additional amazon services. That being said it is a really good Alarm clock as long as you have an Internet connection. If not then it will not work at all..... and tends to loose Internet connection constantly
