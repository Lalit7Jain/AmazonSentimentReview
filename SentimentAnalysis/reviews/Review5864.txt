What the...? The Echo can set an alarm, the Echo can play music on demand, but it can't wake you up with music? Also when I command it to wake me up in a half hour or so to take a nap, that's the timer alarm which you can't change. So I try "set an alarm for a half hour from now." STILL the same annoying timer alarm. Seriously guys, I feel like I bought a cruise ticket for a massive entertainment ship but can't leave my room.  Who developed this thing? Tom Hanks from Castaway? I bought a $180 uncustomizable weather announcer, and I use free apps on my phone for everything else. Yay
