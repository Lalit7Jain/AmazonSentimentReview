If a device is capable of gathering data from multiple sources ( fitbit, lighting, time of day, previous encounters, etc.) it should also be able to anticipate and ASK if a pattern should be repeated. Example: if I regularly activate my security system during certain time periods, if I ( heaven forbid ), "forget" to, Alfred should ask if I would like to activate it. If I order pizza every Friday @ 5:30 then maybe Alfred would ask "are we having pizza tonight?"
