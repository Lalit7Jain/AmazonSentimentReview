Love Alexa. I feel like I have company when home alone. I love convenience of searching for sales, and purchasing directly through Amazon. I also love that Alexa can read my kindle ebooks , as well as the audible books ,when I'm not up to reading. I just wish it was compatible with the Library audio books.  It,s so nice to just talk to Alexa to play music without having to do anything.  I love the sound quality of the Echo compared to the dot. The biggest problem is remembering how to access fife rent info.  You can't just say " are eggs good for my dog to eat". You have to be very specific and say:Alexa,ask Doctor dog if eggs are good for my dog". I have to keep a cheat sheet of the skills and how to ask questions in order to get the results I want.
