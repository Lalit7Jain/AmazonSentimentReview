I don't think the speaker is all that amazing like the reviews say. It's good and does the job but I certainly wouldn't buy it just for its sound quality.  Quick and easy way to turn music on/off just to have some background noise while I'm getting ready or making dinner, but if I really want good sound quality for the pleasure of listening to music, I will turn on my home stereo. Otherwise doesn't do anything the Echo doesn't, but costs quite a bit more.
