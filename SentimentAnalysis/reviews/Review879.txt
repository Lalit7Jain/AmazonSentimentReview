The BEST addition to our family this year. My 3 year old and 1 year old love having music on and the Alexa makes it so easy to change our minds and please everyone by the time breakfast is done. It's fun, it's easy, what is not to love? It's a little challenging for poor Alexa to understand a 3 year old who can't correctly pronounce the letters L, R, V, U and TH but she sure has fun trying to deceiver his commands.
