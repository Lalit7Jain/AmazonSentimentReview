I own two of these. One in my bedroom and one in the living room. This is a very solid product. The sound is great considering the size of this unit. Listening to music is great on this and if you're a prime member then you would definitely be getting your money's worth. I use my echo as part of my home automation, it works great with my lutron light system and my trane thermostats. Once you get one and use it for a while it will be hard to remember what life was like before this. The echo is always improving with constant updates and new skills added daily.
