I like it when it works.  The volume ring went bad, now Amazon tells me that it'll be nearly two weeks before they can decide if they're going to fix it or replace it.  It's only 3 months old but they won't send a replacement until they assess the broken one.  Normally Amazon customer service is top notch but I have to say that this is the first time that they've not met my expectations.  I'm especially surprised that it happened while supporting their own device.  We will miss Alexa while she's gone.
