My two favorite features are really simple ones but they mean a lot: I cook.  I really like to cook.  I can ask Alexa to set a timer while my hands are full and she does it and confirms it has been set.  Oh my goodness…. Bake cookies and set the timer with the oven mitt on?  Pan/plate/pot in hand?  Love it.  The Dot in the kitchen is loud enough I can hear the timer in the living room over the dishwasher and the TV.  The other is the ability to add items to a shopping list whenever I think of the item.  In the kitchen, the living room, the bedroom – if I remember, I can ask Alexa to add the item and she does and confirms it has been added! No digging for a piece of paper that just gets left behind, or a pen, or opening an app on the phone… *sigh* I’m feeling rather spoiled.
