Outstanding sound with wide range of notes. Initial setup was difficult with WIFI and app and took several attempts. Returned the Echo because of  repeated resets and failures to vocally communicate. Disappointed with the results,however will considering purchasing another later but monitor feedback to see if others are having problems.
