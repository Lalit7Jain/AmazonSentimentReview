I received this as a gift, so the only resource I had to commit to it was a wall outlet. And I still don't think it was worth it. It has some ok features, like telling you the weather and sort-of telling you some facts. It is a good speaker for bluetooth (I guess-- I don't have much to compare it to). It is frankly annoying in so many ways, however. It doesn't understand most of what you ask it, even when you're asking something that is within its capabilities. This is an early-gen problem for software: the user has to learn the acceptable commands in the software's limited vocabulary and only use that formula. A truly smart device would learn the ways its users like to give inputs and adapt to it. This thing doesn't seem to be able to do that. At least not /yet/. But this isn't my major complaint with it. My major complaint is that there is just no way to actually TRUST the information it gives us is accurate, or exhaustive, or the best (according to any standard). How do I know the "pizza place" I asked it to search for isn't one that paid to be the top result? Do you trust Amazon to objectively provide you with what you're looking for, or do you think Amazon may be monetizing your needs and wants by filtering and sorting what it presents to you according to its own agenda? That question will need to be answered with confidence before I want a listening device made by a retail sales company in my living room.
