Set up my Echo today. This thing is great. Check scores, the weather, play music, set a timer or alarm, get answers to questions. Just ask Alexa and she will try to answer. Fun. So far I am impressed. I guess if you have a smart phone,(they are too big for my taste), you may not think the Echo is useful because you could do the same thing with your smart phone I guess. But your smart phone is still not as cool. Oh yeah the sound for it's size is great also. I doubt your smart phone sounds this good.
