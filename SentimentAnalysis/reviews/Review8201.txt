So, long review, yes, I know, but she's our first!  I guarantee more people want to see our Mrs.Garrett (Alexa) than they do, a human thing.  To anyone who might wonder, my husband and I are both very pleased with our newest addition, and we recommend everyone to experience the rewarding and fantastic joys of being an Alexa Echo parent.
