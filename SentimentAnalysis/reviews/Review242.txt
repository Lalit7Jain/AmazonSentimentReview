This was neat at first, when I could stream music and goof around with it. Once I delved into the smart home controls, this went from neat to amazing. I can now tell Alexa Go to Bed and the lights downstairs go out, the TV goes off, the door locks and it can even adjust the thermostat. This is truly the easiest home automation device out there!
