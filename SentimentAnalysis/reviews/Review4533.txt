We LOVE this thing.  I ordered it on an impulse and wasn't sure what we would use it for.  My son likes to play games with Alexa.  What I find we are using it for the most is playing music from Pandora.  I'm not crazy about the shopping lists/to do lists.  They work great to record but the various associated apps to use the lists remotely (Alexa, Any.do, Todoist) are not great.  I would love to see them link up with Wunderlist.  That app is great and much more user friendly.  Since it doesn't work great with the apps, I probably won't use that feature much.  I'm bummed about that. That is why I took off a star.
