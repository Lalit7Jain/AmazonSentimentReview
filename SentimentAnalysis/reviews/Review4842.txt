this thing is just too cool... But, I spent a lot of time and money trying to get a bluetooth speaker to bind with her to no avail. After much searching there was a technical note buried in the stuff that said the unit  will not bind by bluetooth to any device. I took back my third speaker, guranteed to  work with Alexa. A thirty dollar one, no, a sixty dollar one, no, a 100 dollar one..and again, no. Don't waste your time. I was trying to get Alexa to be like a hi-fi stereo so I could enjoy the music throughout the room. Not to be so don't try that trick. Other than that, this is a cool piece of equipment.
