I love my Echo , waited a couple years to see what the general opinion  would be, when it seemed to be well like I ordered my Echo and love it. It helps my grandkids with homework ,it fun and my father is 95 and bedridden I have it in his room playing his favorite music. I am able to make groups of his favorite  music and I can control it in any room with my Kindle. Cant wait to set up my house lights, alarm system etc.. Great.
