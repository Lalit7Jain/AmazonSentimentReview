sound quality is actually not bad at all, easily fills a room with nice deep bass and crisp highs. though I do not yet have any smart home products having alexa around to assist with the daily scheduling and general questions as well as entertainment means is fantastic. the only reason I cant give it a full 5 stars is that if you are listening to it at more than 50% volume the microphones wont pick up your voice making the activation phrase useless. other than that its a truly wonderful product
