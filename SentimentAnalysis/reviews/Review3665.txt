The first Echo did not work because my s6 Samsung, one of the approved cell phones for use with the Echo, was not able to open the required Alexa App.  After 6 or 7 hours working with about 7 Amazon technicians they decided the solutikon was to replace my Echo.  They did and the new one had the same problem.  That problem is that the Alexa App does not work with the s6 Samsung phone.and Amazon knows it yet they keep jacking their customers around.  Very bad customer service.  I'm switching to the new Google equivalent.
