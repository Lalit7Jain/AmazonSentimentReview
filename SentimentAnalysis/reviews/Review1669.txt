I love this thing.  It take some getting use to with the commands but for the most part.  I love it.  I found out that you can connect a Bluetooth speaker that has a mic on it and it works just as well as if you were talking to the tower.  I do wish that making a phone call over this would work when I have my phone connected to it.  It auto disconnects and then jumps back on or you can give it the command to do so.
