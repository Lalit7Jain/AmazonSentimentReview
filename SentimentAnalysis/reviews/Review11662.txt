Excellent.  I already had an Amazon Tap.  I purchased a refurbished Echo -- though I would have thought it was brand new coming out of the box.  It was immediately setup (showed up in my Alexa app upon purchase). The quality of the sound is superior to the Tap, and it doesn't suffer from one problem my Tap seems to -- my Tap wouldn't connect to an extended Wifi network.  The voice recognition in the Echo also seems to work better.  I still like the Tap, but I will use it as a Bluetooth speaker in other places (e.g. outside).
