Alexa is the best and I can't wait until further/better updates come out! I have both the Echo and the Dot and the Echo definitely works better than the Dot. The speaker is great for filling up the main spaces of my apartment, the microphone does a decent job of picking up my voice, and it really makes me feel like I'm living in the future!
