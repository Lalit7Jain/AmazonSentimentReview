An amazing help around the house. That's the best way to describe it. Alexa has managed to help me organize lists both shopping and to-do lists so as to keep me on track which my main problem is always forgetting to do things. With each new skill she learns, the more she grows into my life. Need an order placed? Just ask Alexa. Pizza? Just ask Alexa. Have the lights dimmed or turned off? Ask Alexa. At first the idea of a smart home made me think that it would just make me lazy. Instead she made my life easier. I highly recommend also getting other smart home features like the NEST temperature controller, the Smart Lock system, the Smart Light bulbs. Connect your Smart TV and entertainment center directly to her and movies are now one simple request away. I have become a full believer in having a Smart Home now because of the Echo.
