This was a total waste of money.  Seems like every time I quere Alexa all I get is "I am not sure how to answer the question", or "I don't understand the question", the list goes on and on.  I don't like how everything is app driven.  I have so many apps that I can't remember them all and don't have the time to keep looking them up.
