 Whaaaaat?  I have to ask my phone's Google voice for everything alexa can't answer, which is more often than not.  RETURNING!!!!  I should not have to download a skill set & then try to remember how to ask alexa the 'proper way' or she does nothing... ....and don't even try to remember how to word the question cause it's even more ridiculous then the lack of basic AI skill sets that she does have.  Amazon needs to forget about the 'enable skills' & make her more capable of providing the answers that normal people seek daily...  Not ask the question, be told no you have to enable my skills, go to the app, find the skill, enable the skill, try to memorize the long way she requires you to ask the question, just to get the power ball numbers..  By the time you have gone through that, a whole other drawing has happened, gray hairs have started to  grow & I  have forgotten what I asked for in the 1st place....
