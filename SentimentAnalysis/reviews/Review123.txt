Left it unused for months, and just today decided to give it another go.  When I try to reconnect it to wifi it's turned out to be a huge PitA and simply will not connect anymore.  I tried using two desktop machines, but they just got stuck at the page telling me to connect to the set-up network; tried a Fire Phone, but that refused to stay connected to the set-up network long enough to continue; tried an iPhone but that got confused about what it was doing and brought up blank dialog boxes, got stuck in the wrong dialogue repeatedly, and eventually after several different approaches I got the phone connected to Echo but it just refused the wifi password over and over.
