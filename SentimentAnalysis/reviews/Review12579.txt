I am visually handicapped and this is the best product in it's price range to help in everyday activities.I like how it syncs the calendar and shopping and to do lists with my iPhone.  Finds your keys of phone when hooked up with TrackR app.  Does too much to list in this review.  Buying two more for holiday gifts for my busy daughters and their families.
