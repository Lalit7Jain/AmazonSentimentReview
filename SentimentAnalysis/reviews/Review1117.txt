We've been using Echo since Christmas and are generally pleased with it. I am not fond of some of the gimmicky skills and games you can play with the echo and generally use it for flash briefing and weather. Herein lies my problem with Alexa. You can't ask it a question that requires web surfing. In this day and age it would seem that this would be a primary design feature for something like this. I don't want it to shop for me. Answering a question or two now and then would be really nice.  The music connections and sound are awesome. Getting it to operate like Siri would be nice.
