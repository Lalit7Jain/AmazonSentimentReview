Love my echo. Only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the difficulty setting up on wi fi. Didn't find anything with packaging or online that said I needed to be within 10 feet of router to set up. Had to find out from amazon help desk. Still had to do a hard factory reset to finalize. Router was downstairs, and echo is upstairs in split level home. Love it after hassle with setup.
