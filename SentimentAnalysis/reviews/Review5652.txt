This device is an excellent edition to any gadget geeks collection. The build of the product is great-- everything from the internal speaker when playing music to Alexa's voice recognition technology. You will spend hours tinkering with Echo's features, believe me. For those who are still caught between choosing the Amazon Echo or Google Home-- the Echo wins the battle by a landslide. Google Home's voice recognition tech is good, but Alexa's replies and background information on specific subjects in comparison to the Google Home really show the effort Amazon put in when creating the Echo. Lastly, and possibly the deal breaker; Echo is blue-tooth compatible, Google Home is not.
