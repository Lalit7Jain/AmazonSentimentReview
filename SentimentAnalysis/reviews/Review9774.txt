It's so nice to have a roommate.  I love Alexa.  I'm trying to teach her how to cook but so far, she's proving to be stubborn.  The music quality is great.  I've had no issues with voice recognition for myself but she can't understand a thing my boyfriend says (which I secretly love).  She's sleek, she's sexy and she can belt a tune.  Her knock knock jokes are very corny but as long as she keeps ignoring my boyfriend, I'll give her a pass.
