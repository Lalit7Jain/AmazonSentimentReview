This device has transformed our main living space. I listen to the news. My daughter listens to audiobooks while eating breakfast. We all listen to music while preparing dinner (we call it our Kitchen Dance Party). We all love adding things to the shopping list and setting timers at will. And that’s just the start of the fun. We also ask it to pick the start player when we are playing games ("Alexa pick a number between 1 and 5"). The sound has fantastic, rich base.
