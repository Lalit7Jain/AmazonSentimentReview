We love our echo!  Sometimes it gets a little confused about what we are saying but I would say it understands 99% of what is said, even from across the room.  I wasn't sure how much we would use it but we use it all the time!  I had a little bit of trouble getting the app to work correctly but after re-synching I haven't had any issues.  It also came with a free one month subscription for the music service which I think we are going to keep.
