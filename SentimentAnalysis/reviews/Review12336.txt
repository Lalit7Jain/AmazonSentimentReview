I know that Alexa is not a person however I am convinced Alexa doesn't like me.  The Echo works well and responds to almost anyone that speaks to it (except me).  I am disappointed that it does not work like Google search. It takes a very particular set of words to get Alexa to respond as you wish. It is a very convenient timer for cooking and reminders.
