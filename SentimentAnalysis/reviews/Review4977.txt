Amazon hit a home run with this device. Easy to set up and works like it should. I'm still learning to set-up skills that suit my needs but overall I would recommend this product. I also have the Fire TV 4k media player with Alexa as well. I never thought Amazon would be a player in the tech world but here they are, and doing it better than anyone else.
