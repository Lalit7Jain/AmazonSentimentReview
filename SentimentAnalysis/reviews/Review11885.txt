I like it enough but still lacking. I would move over to the whole Amazon ecosystem if it had better phone/tablet options but it doesn't so Alexa should be more open to connecting to other systems. I use IFTTT to connect Alexa but it's a hassle to me. And if you want Alexa to do different things, you have to enable the skill and then remember each skill by its unique name. Too difficult to remember each app name when I should be able to say, "Alexa, do This." That makes it less intuitive. She's not able to take on traffic news either. She can only tell you traffic details for preprogrammed routes. The details are limited.
