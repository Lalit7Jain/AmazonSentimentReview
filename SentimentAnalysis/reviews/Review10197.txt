You know what would be great?  If the Echo was wireless.  You don't specifically mention this in the product description.  If a device can turn off my tv/lights, you'd definitely think it would be wireless too.  That seems like a huge missed opportunity Amazon.  I'm an Amazon employee too, but again, huge missed opportunity.
