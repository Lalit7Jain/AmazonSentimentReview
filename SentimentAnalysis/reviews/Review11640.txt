Let me start by saying that I'm not an audiophile. Until I got the Echo, I mostly listened to music in the car, and even then it's just the radio on a stock audio system. I've actually found the idea of listening to music at home a bit tedious. I didn't like the small speakers that came with iPhone docks (or the price of good ones), and managing playlists on my Mac was annoying. I really didn't want to go to my computer to play music, and even if I did, it only played from the speakers on my computer, which wasn't in an optimal location.
