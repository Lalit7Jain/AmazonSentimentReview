Update: originally gave it 1 star before and updated to 4 after finally getting it working. there are some known issues and after working with both amazon customer service and xfinity (they were both on the phone) it started working. i was impressed that amazon customer service was willing to work w xfinity. The xfinity gateway router needed to be reset back to factory settings and Alexa needed to be reset (paper clip in small reset hole on bottom). Alexa still would not connect after just the gateway reset but connected as soon as we did the physical reset. There are a descent number of skills that Alexa has, however the att text skill is kind of disappointing.
