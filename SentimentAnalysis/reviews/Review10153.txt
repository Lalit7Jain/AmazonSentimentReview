I've only had it one day and already love it! This morning I checked my calendar, weather, set an alarm, listened to jokes, made a to-do list, a shopping list, and listened to my favorite music all through simple voice commands! (and with out leaving my cozy bed LOL!!!!) Only complaint is that I had to order a battery pack separate or you need to have it plugged in 24/7. Also, I have not learned all the features yet, but once this connects to your phone (text, read emails, and make calls) everyone will want one!
