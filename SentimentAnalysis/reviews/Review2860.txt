Our first Echo had trouble connecting and we never did get it working correctly.  Second one connected no problem and we like it.  Alexa is really good at voice recognition and understands a lot of commands. We have mostly used it for music for now, but are looking into whole house automation and the possibilities there.  Amazon Music is kind of limited.  If you like a station, they tend to repeat the same artists, so I like to my phone and use Pandora, which has more variety.
