The Echo is a good thing.  I do not have all of the attachments to have it turn on lights, control the heat, etc.  Just ordinary things.  The one disappointment is the inability to make phone calls.  WiFi and Bluetooth do not help.  If you want to get whatever it is from Amazon, then it works fine.  Other places not so good.
