We really did love our Amazon Echo, right up until it quit working 15 months after purchasing, and after the warranty ran out. Amazon support said it might be the power adapter and they gave us a credit for $20.00 to purchase another one. But, that didn't fix the problem. So, now the best they will do is give us another small credit ($30.00) to apply towards another Echo. We have decided to wait and get the Google one.
