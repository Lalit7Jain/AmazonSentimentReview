I bought it for my husband for his B day. I love it, he thinks their is a woman inside, he keeps talking to the machine like he is talking to a human, he thinks it's funny. He says meek my wife happy and ply some .... the mechune doesn't get it, I keep telling him to say Alexa than say what you want .... he makes me laugh .he just doesn't get it
