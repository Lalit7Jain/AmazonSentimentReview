I've only had Echo for a few days, but am already learning to like it very much.  It still has a few shortcomings, but hopefully its data base will improve with time.  For example, today I asked Alexa if my wife's flight had departed on time for home and she couldn't understand the question, even though I repeated it for her.  (I fired up the computer and looked up the answer for myself.)  Perhaps one of the next things they can add to Alexa's data base is access to various airlines' sites and their schedules.  The same could probably also be said for Amtrak and Greyhound schedules, so those who travel by ground can keep updated as well.
