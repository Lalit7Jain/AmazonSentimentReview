This was a birthday gift to jump-start my home automation project but it does much more than my purpose for it. Alexa reads me the news, tells me how to cook, sings to me, tells me jokes AND can notify me of all the Amazon bargains for items in my wishlist on top of controlling my lights, thermostat, and irrigation system with just a simple spoken request. Amazing device!
