This is a great product. Easy set up. Easy to use. In one short week it has been a pleasure to have a house filled with music and entertainment. Very highly recommended. I have already order additional Echo Dots to expand the Echo environment throughout my home. My 4 year old daughter also enjoys the stories and kids music. She taught herself how to use this in the first 3 minutes have I had it connected.
