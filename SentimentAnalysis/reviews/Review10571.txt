All I can say is "why did I wait so long to get this".  I have been looking for over a year and all it took was a word from  our physician.  He was saying all the things it could do and was so excited about it, we had to order it.  Setup as easy.  I still need to learn all the app and how to use but I love  the music it plays, gives us the weather, tells us corny jokes, and so many other things.  I LOVE this toy/learning means and intend to use it daily.
