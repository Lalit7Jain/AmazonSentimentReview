Just received it.  I am already starting to love it.  It is probably my fault for not reading the description completely but imagine my surprise when I realized it did not have some kind of a battery to make it work unplugged.  What devices like this come without a battery anymore?  I really do not want to shell out another $50 for an after market product.  Mildly disappointed.
