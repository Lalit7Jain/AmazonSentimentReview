This thing is a piece of garbage. First the Alexa app would not download and I needed to call customer service. After finally deleting and reloading the app THREE times, I got the app to load properly. Then the app would not enable the device to connect to my internet. Again I called customer service and they had me re-boot my computer, that didn't work. Then customer service wanted me to take a pin, yes a pin!!! and reboot the Alexa. At this point I wanted this $179.00 piece of junk out of my house. I urge anyone reading this, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY on this garbage. I spent two hours of my life on this garbage that I will never get back.
