There's not much to say about the Echo that hasn't been said in previous reviews, so I'll keep it simple. Excellent sound quality, easy to set up, easier to use. Picks up your voice from anywhere in the room and you don't have to shout at it. Talking at a normal volume (and not even directly at it) is enough. Voice training feature is excellent, it really tailors the device to your own voice, inflection, accent, etc. So far it has rarely misheard/misunderstood me.
