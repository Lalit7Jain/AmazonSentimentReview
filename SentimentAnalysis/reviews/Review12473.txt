I had an Amazon Echo Dot first and loved it so much I ordered this for a better speaker.  My children have so much fun with it as does everyone in the family.  They like to ask jokes, check math problems, make grocery lists, listen to music,  check the weather and news.  We also use it all the time as a timer.  It is nice to use it for things you don't have to stop to write down or stop to look up, you can just tell it to Alexa or ask Alexa.  Beaware though that to play music through it you have to have a premium account through Spotify and we have had the trial premium accounts but not longer.  Without that, we don't find it quite as entertaining and useful.  But to purchase the Echo and then have to pay for an account at Spotify too, adds up.  Overall we are pleased but not do not like that we have to have a premium account at Spotify to use the music feature with Spotify.
