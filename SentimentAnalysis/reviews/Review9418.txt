I wanted an Echo as soon as I started seeing them advertised. My husband asked what I wanted for Chirstmas and I thought it was the perfect opportunity to get one. I instantly fell in love with it! I am a music freak and this was just what I needed to play my music list when I am doing housework. I talk to Alexa all the time and find more features as I go. Each morning, I ask her the weather forecase and she delivers. My husband loves asking her jokes, playing Jeopardy, and getting his "flash report". You have to check this out!
