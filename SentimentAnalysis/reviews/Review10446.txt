I've been an Echo user since the very beginning, pre-ordering my Echo back in January 2015.  What started out as experiment in AI has now become a very useful tool in our household.  I've since added a couple more Echo Dots around the house because I found myself wanting a reply to calling "Alexa" anywhere in the house I was. We started using it for music, time and weather.  Now we use it for news, directions, ordering, controlling our home thermostat, and most recently, as a personal assistant in my home office.  Way better than Cortana or Siri. Have since added Amazon Music's subscription for Echo for even more music capability.  I am probably most impressed by the commitment the Amazon team has to actively improving the platform, which is communicated to me through occasional email updates on the capabilities they have added to Echo.  The full-blown speaker version is good -- I had it in my kitchen for a long while as my primary music device.  I've since moved the full-sized Echo to the master bathroom and use it for all my updates in the morning.  I now use Echo dots connected to my computer and to my Sonos as the main kitchen and office Alexas.  Either way, you'll find a device format that works for you and once you commit to actually learning how best to use it, it really is a cool tool that you can use to make your day easier and more informative.
