I gave this as a family gift. We set it up the day after Christmas, very excited about the possibilities. Within a few hours, the unit started making a headache-inducing buzzing noise. I figured it was an aberration and plugged it back in the next day to hear the same thing. I called Amazon customer service and talked to two different people, who said they never heard of such a thing. The bottom line is neither apologized or seemed to care that this product that was a Christmas gift was unbelievably defective on DAY ONE. The bottom line was they wanted me to send it back so they could work on it. Oh, and I had to pay $1 to get a label because I don't have a printer. What I expected from Amazon was an apology and an offer to immediately replace was obviously a defective unit. Both customer service people listened to the sound. Since I was well within the return time, I couldn't believe they expected me to send it back and then settle for a refurbished unit. Seriously? Uh, pass. I'm a 20-year Amazon customer, with two Kindles, a fire TV stick that was a disaster, Amazon Prime member, et cetera. I expected better. What a disappointment.
