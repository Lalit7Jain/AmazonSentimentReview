First of all as a product its features are not as robust as Google Home currently.  I don't think they will ever be.  Consider this as a bonus item to tie in your amazon products and services.  I use google home for my home automation mostly, but I have an Alexa in my bedroom to take care of the home automation in my personal area.  Alexa easily accesses my kindle library to read my purchases to me directly next to my bed.  So this would be a small advantage the Echo system has over google.  As far as hardware goes, it's similar enough to the Google Home.  I think Google Home wins on the low end side compared to Alexa at full volume.  Alexa does sound a little more crisp in the high end.  Ultimately, personal preference really.  I own and use both Alexa and Google Home for different things.  They compliment each other so nicely.
