I love this thing.  I use it primarily for Spotify and random questions.  The rest of the time we just argue.  I ask her a question and she doesn't know, over and over again.  It's like living with a woman without living with a woman.  I'm just afraid that one day she will become self aware.  End up with a cross between SkyNet and The Borg.  She'll lock my doors and say we need to talk.  Imagine Kathy Bates in Misery.  She'll turn my appliances against me and all will be lost.  Judgements Day is upon is.  The only fate is what we make.
