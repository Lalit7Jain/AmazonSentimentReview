This SHOULD be a great product. It does sound and function terrifically, UNTIL it falls over because it is top-heavy, which is a design flaw, if it is indeed a flaw in design. We advance purchased this for my son who waited patiently for it for months. At first he loved it. He has taken great care of this device, but it was very slightly bumped over and fell onto his desktop which caused the top to pop off. He tried to make it work, which for awhile it did, but the top kept popping off and now it doesn't work, which is not great, especially since we paid so much for the unit. The unit was broken in May, but he tried to work around the problem. Now that popping the top on doesn't work, we can't send it back for repair, since it is now out of warranty (June 2016). We really love the idea here, but the design is flawed. Now we see cases on Amazon which help keep the Echo from falling over, which really shouldn't have been such an issue.
