Worst thing I have ever purchased from Amazon.  It has never worked longer than one hour continuously.  Usually stays on anywhere from 5 minutes to 10 minutes than goes off line and has to be rebooted.  It did not work properly when I first took it out of the box.  After three days with three different customer service and tech people, it stayed on for almost an hour.  I have moved it three times to get it ever closer to the wifi. I have rebooted and reinstalled it at least twelve times.  I was gone for three weeks and unplugged it in my absence in the hope that it might work when I returned and that was the final move, closest to the wifi.  It has been worse.  Today in frustration, I again called customer service and spent about 30 minutes with someone that kept telling me he would fix my problem.  I finally had to ask how he was going to do that when everyone else had failed.  Turned out he was just saying it to fill time while we waited for Alexa to YET AGAIN reboot.  I was asked to go get another power source and try that.  I had to share that I have not additional power sources for Alexa nor should I have to have one.  After the reboot and the half hour and a call back 15 minutes later, Alexa managed to stay on for 20 minutes.  This is the biggest waste of money and no one at Amazon seems to know how to fix the ones, like mine, that do not work.
