I want a refund but they will not give it to me. Just missed the date the only thing is is good for is turning lights on and off. End of story it is otherwise totally useless. I do so much business with Amazon I wish they would just let me return this item. Along with the echo. Absolutely useless. Would have rather gotten the Google version.
