Love it! Use it daily for a wide variety of simple tasks: weather, traffic, news, alarms, etc. It's basically like having a smart phone "AI", but you don't need to have your phone in hand. Alexa is very good at picking up what you're saying as well, so I don't really have problems where I have to repeat things. Lot of other stuff I know Alexa can do that I haven't tried yet, so I'm looking forward to utilizing her other features as well.
