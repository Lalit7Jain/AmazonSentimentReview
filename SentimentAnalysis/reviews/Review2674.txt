Not as many options as I imagined there would be. More "skills" require apps that I have to memorize the name of the app first, then ask the question. For example, I can't just ask "TV listings tonight for CBS". There's some skill I needed to load and then I have to say the name of it (something like "Ask TV") first, and then the question.
