Music: There are some great things to say here. And some WTF?!?! moments. Trying teach my kids various styles of music. Told it to play Nothing but a hound dog (meaning the original Elvis Presley). Alexa tries to play some weird thing by Sedgewick something or other- Couldn't get it to STOP fast enough. You have to be VERY specific. Alexa likes to play some third and forth rate versions of very popular and classic songs from unknown (and unwanted) "artists". This has been a constant annoyance with all genres of music. You ask for Adel and you get musik instrumentals. And when you tell her to NEVER play one of these versions again- she doesn't understand.
