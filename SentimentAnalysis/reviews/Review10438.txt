So dreadfully disappointed.  This is a limited use item.  Amazon limits your music imports to 250 songs at the base commitment monthly fee (8 bucks) and charges for your uploads monthly after that. The news management is awkward to adjust after your initial programming. All in all I rather wish I hadn't bothered to give amazon a try on this one.  Back to Sonos.
