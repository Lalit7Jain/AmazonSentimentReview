Echo is a game changer.  I like being able to add stuff to my grocery list, and have it link to the list on my phone. I can ask what the weather will be like, order Amazon items,just by asking. I can ask for a playlist, say, for dinner music, or studying, or sync it to my home stereo. The sound is decent, and I find that Echo does a good job of "hearing" me when I ask a question.  She understands my kids too, which can actually be a problem. Echo doesn't discern between enquirers. My kids have heard us order stuff, and the little parrots they are, have done the same. My grocery list also seems to be peppered with gummy bears and ice cream too...
