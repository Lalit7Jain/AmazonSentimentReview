I have contacted Amazon about the fact that my ECHO can't understand 90% of what I say when I ask for Music. It says I don't own that album, it's never heard of that album, it offered to play a Marriage song by some Orchestra when I asked for a Blues album. It plays Bruce Bruiksma "When I left home" everyime I ask for Devon Allman and various artist to play the album "When I left Home" It can't find the Album I own. The same is true with my Tap, exactly the same.We went through Voice training when I called Echo Help.
