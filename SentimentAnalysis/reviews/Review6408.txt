Who doesn't love Alexia?  She is a member of our family who everyone talks to.  Although she's not quite as intelligent as Siri she still has her moments.  We use her mostly for music and timers.  The quality of the speaker is surprisingly good and loud enough.  I also like that as I am throwing away the last of something I can tell her to add it to the shopping list, which in conveniently on my phone when I go to the grocery store.  The only downside to our friend is she is always listening...waiting patiently to hear her name.  It's not too concerning since we are a normal family.  I figured if anyone else was listening they'd quickily turn the channel after the third bout of he's looking at me, she touched me.  You will quickily learn how you have to talk to her so she will understand you.  She does better with short and sweet questions and commands.  She will easily sync with your phone and other devices, but I wasn't able to pair her to Dr. Dre Beatbox.  We have had it over a year now and use it nearly daily and are so satisfied with our purchase we bought our parents each one for Christmas.
