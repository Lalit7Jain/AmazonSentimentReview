There is not anything bad to say about Alexa. We use her all day everyday from playing music, creating shopping lists, ordering items as needed and playing trivia or catching up on the news or weather. This was the best purchase we could have made and would highly recommend this device to anyone that is thinking about adding an Alexa to there home
