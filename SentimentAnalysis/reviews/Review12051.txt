 - is she eavesdropping?  that's a question I've been asking myself more and more lately.  After all, it's a device that's always on just waiting to hear her name...sometimes in the middle of a conversation (and not with her), she says "Sorry, I don't know how to help you with that".  There is a button on top to turn off the microphone.  I've started using that more and more but does that really work?  I know she records commands to her...but does she record anything else?  Big brother or big sister?  I guess we give up privacy for convenience?
