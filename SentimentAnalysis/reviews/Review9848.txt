My wife bought Amazon Echo during the Cyber Monday deals and I was looking forward to testing the functionality of this device.  After opening the box it took just a few minutes to set up, power on and connect to the wifi.  Weather, music, news.....and more just by asking Alexa!  Sound quality is very good, as was witnessed when I asked Alexa to play Natty Dread by Bob Marley.
