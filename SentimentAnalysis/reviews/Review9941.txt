I bought this as one of the daily special values on QVC for $149 and it was well worth the money! I often host game nights and other gatherings and generally have my TV set to a music choice channel. I wanted something more centrally located, as well as something that could play specific songs with a simple voice request, and the Echo achieves these things and many more! What a fantastic product!
