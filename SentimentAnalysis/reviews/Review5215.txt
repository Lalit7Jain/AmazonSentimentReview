We love Alexa, Tap and Dot... yup we have them all and use them daily. We stream music, we make shopping lists and get the weather. I even place an Amazon order from time to time. We traveled South for a few months and they made the trip with us. We have friends using them and they love them. I am a baby boomer in love with the easy access this gives us to music of all kinds, Tap lets us bring that to out deck area, Bluetooth lets us crank it up to Bluetooth enabled speakers. And our grandson loves a good joke!! Alexa has so many uses she is much appreciated in our home. Thank you Amazon!
