this echo is a lot of fun.  the kids enjoy asking it for jokes.  We have only used it a couple days and are impressed. its fun to tell it to do things and it does, like play music from a certain artist, etc.  amazon did well with this one.  if you have kids, you might want to turn off the feature where people can buy stuff with their voice.  Our kids were quick to try to make amazon purchases with their voice!!.  you just go into the app on your phone/tablet etc and turn of purchases.  very easy.
