3. It can't Google: If you ask Alexa if she can Google things, she will tell you she can Bing things for you.  OK, so why can't she give me a meatloaf recipe, if she can connect to Bing?  I don't really care for that.  Amazon, please make your own search engine, or fine-tune Bing search capability.  If this device can provide all the answers to our questions via Google or Bing, it would be a worthy competitor to Google Home.
