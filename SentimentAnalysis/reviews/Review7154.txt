We have a child who would not turn the volume down on the computer. We could not easily find a Bluetooth speaker that also had a remote volume control that was cheap.  So despite the stupid echo tv ads we bought an echo and bought the remote. I recommend "Simon Says" with the remote - it's always fun to have Alexa give any bad news like "turn off that game and set the table." It is a quieter house.  It took about a week to figure out the other uses. Samsung, Hue, Nest, skills. We now have a echo & 2 dots and a smart house. I haven't touched a light switch in months.
