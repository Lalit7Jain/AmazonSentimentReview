I like my Echo but it looks like Google Home is creeping into the scene.  Echo needs to at least fix the music call....A few others have made this comment....When you request a song sometimes Alexa has her own mind and sometime it will find the correct song and sometimes it wont and this is NOT the speech. One example.....I bought the song "Forever Country"....Well Alexa frequently plays a SAMPLE or sometimes it will play the correct song that I BOUGHT on AMAZON in my Library.....Echo wins over Google Home....barely!
