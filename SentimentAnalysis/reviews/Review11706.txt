Alexa is awesome! We purchased her a couple of months ago after my wife had a leg injury that confined her to the house most of the time. Since then, she has provided endless entertainment. She plays music for us, helps us with our shopping list, gives us the weather, and more. The only downside is she tends to respond our requests in odd ways. For example, I have a window, so I know it is sunny out. I ass Alexa what the current temperature is, and she gives me the fully weather info for the day! Clearly she understood the question, but chose to not answer it. The shopping list is also a great feature, but needs work. Sometimes she misunderstands, and adds the wrong item. Once that happens there is no way to remove the item except by pulling out my phone and deleting it manually.  Alexa is awesome, but not perfect. These minor issues are why I rate her at 4 stars instead of 5.
