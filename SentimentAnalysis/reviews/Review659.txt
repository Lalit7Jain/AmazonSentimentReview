I was so excited to get it and have it play my music by just my voice.  It did pretty good with that but when I told it to play Roy Orbison it said there are no songs by him although I have 23 in Amazon music, purchased from Amazon,but  when I say the name of the song it will play it.  I don't want to always tell it the name of the song but just play Roy Orbison, for example.  Very disappointed.
