The skills are annoying because you have to remember all the key words for EACH one in order to use them. I think that once they have been enabled, they should just work. I shouldn't have to memorize a special way to get the info. I would think this is possible since I can get the weather by asking for it any number of ways and Alexa always understands. But if I ask for information from a skill, I won't get it unless I say the special words first.
