Item worked ok out of the box, but soon started to experience intermittent connection issues.  Every other wi-fi enabled device in my home had no issues, so it was not the network.  At first, a reset would remedy the issue.  Eventually, after a couple months, it would not connect to wi-fi at all, despite the app telling me it was connected.  Tried numerous troubleshooting methods, reinstalled app, setting up as if it were new, factory reset, etc.  Still just an orange ring and no activity.  So, put in for a refund/replacement and first e-mail gives me troubleshooting tips (that have all been previously attempted with no luck).  Second request for a replacement or refund gets me an e-mail that I have to call on the phone.  Unfortunately, working very long and odd hours I put the call in from work.  Despite telling the operator that I have tried every single thing that he suggests to me, he refuses to offer me a replacement or refund unless I am physically with the device and trying AGAIN the exact things I have tried before multiple times, but with him on the line.  I am tech savvy and not an idiot.  But Amazon seems to want to treat me like one if it gets them out of providing service.  I am a long time customer and have placed about 70 orders in the last 6 months as well as being a Prime subscriber.  But if this is how Amazon treats their loyal consumers, I think I will have to take my business elsewhere.  At this point, I may just throw the Echo against the nearest wall and wait for Google's device to arrive.  And really, even when the Echo worked, it really didn't offer much other than the weather and sports scores.  The light switch control can be done with a Wemo app without even needing it.  Sorely disappointed in this poorly constructed gimmick.  Even more disappointed that Amazon seems to want to spend more effort jerking me around than actually resolve my issue with their defective product.
