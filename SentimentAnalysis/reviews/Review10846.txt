a lot of good feature. It does a lot if you have amazon prime. I not sure it will work without.. I do not use iit a lot because it has a hard time hearing me in my house configuration. They have smaller ones you get for other rooms but I understand that the sound is .not as good so you need a blue tooth speaker with them. If your just looking for a music player I would rather use my android because I can take it with me. It is a toy to me but it is a tool for other people.
