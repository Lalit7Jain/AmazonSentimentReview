Soon after I received my Echo, I asked it "how many trees are there in the United States ?"  The blue light indicating that it was thinking kept spinning around and I actually unplugged it after awhile because I didn't think it was going to respond.  But several weeks later, when I asked the same question, Alexa immediately responded with "... 600 million ..."  So, I'm guessing that it eventually found my original answer and 'banked-it' for later.
