EVERYONE WANTS ONE. I got myself one and my grandson, son, and daughter want. I debated and went on Black Friday . I could not pass the deal. If on sale again. 2 more will be purchased. It understands all. The SOUND sold me. Progress is getting there to what it can answer. Google and Alexa. Future!! Music selection is enough for me. It's playing enough Christmas songs while putting up the tree-Charlie Brown. It give the weather time, sleep timer while it reads me to sleep. The volume adjustment.
