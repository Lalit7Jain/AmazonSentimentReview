My husband bought me an Echo for Christmas.  I have had my echo for almost a week, and I feel duped by Amazon.  I was expecting something more along the lines of Siri, or Google, but instead I have what amounts to as a glorified speaker.  You have to enable skills from the Alexa app, and if Alexa doesn't know the answer, she tells you to go check it out on her app!  WTF???  Really Amazon?  If I'd wanted to do that, I'd have gone to my tablet and asked Google in the first place.
