My Echo has become part of the family!  I use it to get quick updates of news and weather.  I listen to podcasts. There are new "skills" being added all of the time.  I recently just added my first smart light to the system and am enjoying it. I play my favorite music while getting ready to go out.  I'm loving all of the ways to use this device!  (Amazon...don't mess this up with your proposed touch echo!  It's wonderful the way it is! )
