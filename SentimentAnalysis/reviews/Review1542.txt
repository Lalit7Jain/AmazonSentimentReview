We have the Echo and two Echo Dots, some smart plugs and bulbs too.  I love being able to walk in and just give a command and have lights, tv, etc. on demand.  We bought one for my mother-in-law because at over 80 years of age it was not as easy for her to get to light switches in her apartment if she had to get up in the middle of the night or when going to bed.  She now has trained her Echo (as we have too) with so many features and smart home options that since her husband's death, she seems to be in better spirits.  She tells us all the time how much she loves the Echo, it tells her jokes, plays games with her, plays music, gives her sports updates, and she can turn on and off lights and appliances with her voice.  The Echo is sooo much fun, easy to set up and link to your Amazon account for so little cost and effort.  Hope you enjoy your's as much as we're enjoying ours! Now if we can just get our local news station to stop saying "Alexa" and call it the Echo or Echo Dot that would be great! I cannot tell you how many times they have activated my Echo and I've had to tell Alexa to stop with orders or playing songs, etc. thanks to irresponsible anchor people.
