We LOVE our "Alexa".  She has her place on our kitchen island with her pretty stand. She's become a part of our family as silly as that sounds.  I listen to weather, flash briefing.  We play music every day.  Loved her so much, we bought her a 'sister', Echo for our bedroom. We use the alarm and music for her. Two echos in our house was a must.
