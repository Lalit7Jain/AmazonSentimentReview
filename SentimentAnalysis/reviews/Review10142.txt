AMAZON CUSTOMER SERICE is HORRIBLE!  I have speaking to a customer service rep for over 30 minutes and he seems clueless as to how to help me with what should be a relatively easy inquiry.  I bought an AMAZON ECHO as a gift last week and noticed that it went on sale days after my purchase and I called to ask if they could provide a credit for the $40.00 difference.  I was told by the young man ( who had difficulty communicating ) that it would be best if I returned the one purchased and buy it again with the sale price.  REALLY it was a gift and I am not willing to ask the recipient of the gift to give it back.  What?  C'mon Amazon I am a Prime Member and this is the best solution you got?  By the way I am still on hold while he tries to find his supervisor.  It is now over 45 minutes...50 MINUTES AND COUNTING...NOW over an hour...UNACCEPTABLE
