lol, I won't be surprised if Alexa can actually write a review about herself!  Just amazing.  I love giving the commands and Alexa replies :)  Although I can't use all features yet, but the ones I can, are just amazing.  I like that Alexa can access the wikipedia library and read from it.  The amazon music library is another nice feature I can use.  But the location and placing orders via Alexa is not active yet in Bahrain, so i can't use them features yet.  Check with Amazon to see which countries are providing these services.  That is said and done, it is still a great device that I can enjoy and make use of without really missing on ordering my next Starbucks coffee through Alexa ;)
