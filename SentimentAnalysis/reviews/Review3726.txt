This is the biggest piece of GARBAGE (euphemism). It worked for like 6 months, then disconnected and stopped working and I have never been able to get it work again. The lights never turn off. I've tried resetting it literally about 50 times, I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app (which doesn't uninstall because when I reinstall I'm still "logged in" even if I've run a cleaner and/or reformatted my phone). I've tried resetting my router. I reset, unplugged it and left it off for a month. I've contacted tech support who were not helpful at all, basically telling me to redo all the things I've already tried. NOTHING is getting this thing back online, so it's just a big expensive brick. WASTE OF MONEY!
