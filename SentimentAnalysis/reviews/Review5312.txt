A must have.  I love how easy the set up was.  It connects to our Honeywell Wi-Fi thermostat and it's great being able to tell it to turn the thermostat up or down.  The sound quality is phenomenal.  We have ours in the main part of the house and then we have an echo.in our bedroom.  Next, we are going to purchase the outlets and light switches that work with Alexa.
