The item was bought as a present. We asked few times if it will work in Europe. The answer was - yes. Well, it doesn't!!! The guy who received the present contacted Amazon, was advised to download some app, but that app only available for Germany, and he lives in Holland. Please help to resolve the issue. As it's not only spoiled birthday mood, it's already getting frustrating.
