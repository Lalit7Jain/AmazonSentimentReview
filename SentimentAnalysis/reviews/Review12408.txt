I really love my Echo.  We listen to music with it all the time in the kitchen and have fun finding new playlists of kids music to get our toddler dancing like a maniac.  We mostly use it for music via Prime or Pandora, but I also use other things like alarms and conversions.  The sound is great for the size and I've since bought one for my dad for his birthday and he loves it as well.
