Love Alexa - she's my new best friend. I really didn't think I would use this and thought it would be a silly purchase and a waste of money but OMG - I love love it! I think in order to take full advantage, you really need to be a Prime member and an avid Amazon shopper (as clearly I am...) I have many playlists set up through Amazon Music, although you can listen to TuneIn, iHeartRadio, your iTunes (through Bluetooth) and a number of other music "stations" like Pandora. I am an Audible customer, so I can listen to my audiobooks and I LOVE the Flash briefing feature - with news and weather. I have also used her to order from my previous order history on Amazon. She is on every day in our house now and it's my new favorite thing. The speaker is great for music and central location in the kitchen/great room allows for easy communication with her and great sound for all.
