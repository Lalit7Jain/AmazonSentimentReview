I may just return this  it worked great the first week and a half. Nown I tell it to play music or find my phone and it tells me it's doing it but doesn't very do anything. It's turned into a regular Bluetooth speaker more than anything. I'm lso upset that I finally caved and bought the thing and 2 weeks later it's on sale for $40 cheaper, another reason to return it aND just buy a whole new one. I'm super disappointed.
