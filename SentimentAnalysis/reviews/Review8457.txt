Great device. Its easy to set up and works as described. The only difficulty I had was having it read my iPhone calendar. At this time it only sees Google calendar. Tech support told me that soon it will see the iPhone calendar. In the meantime I'm using Google calendar and it works. Otherwise my family loves it and we ordered one for our daughter's home.
