From what I've read, there are still a lot of things that Google can do that Alexa can't, but I don't have personal experience with GH to be able to compare the two. As far as the echo is concerned, I'm pretty satisfied with its performance. I really just wanted a Bluetooth speaker, so everything else is added bonus.
