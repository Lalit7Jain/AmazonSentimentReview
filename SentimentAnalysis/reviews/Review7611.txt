First, I'm not an Amazon prime member and can't do a few things because of it, but I love it. It's in my kitchen. I made 3 playlist of different music and the speaker has a great sound. I can't use Amazon music but I did enable Pandora for the music, radio stations and comedy You can enable it to do a lot of different things. I also got an Amazon dot for Christmas and have that one in my bedroom. I still have a lot to learn about it and will. I can get traffic directions but can't access it for construction or tie ups on the roads, you have to be a prime member to do that. Love it! Love it!
