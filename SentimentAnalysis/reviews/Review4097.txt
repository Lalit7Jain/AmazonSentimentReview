the bass is much better than the echo dot, obviously, since you are paying well over $100 for the speakers in this one.. the manual is skimpy.. very skimpy.. AND, i can see it all tilts very liberal.. ask foir rush limbaugh and is does not have anything for you.. now maybe if i get tuniin radio going it will find talk/conservative/rush limbaugh.. i have yet to get that far.. hope springs eternal, here..
