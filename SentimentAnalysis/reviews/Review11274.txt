I love my echo! I enjoy being able to listen to a variety of music, my regular radio stations etc.It has great sound quality that I can hear throughout my house. It is easy to use, easy to set up and fun! My son loves that Alexa has a "dinosaur" music playlist just for him. I use the alarm feature on the echo every singe day to remind me to do things, or just as a timer for baking. I like that the echo can keep me updated on the news as well. I use my echo everyday and enjoy using it. I'm still figuring out everything Alexa can do. I'd recommend the echo to anyone!
