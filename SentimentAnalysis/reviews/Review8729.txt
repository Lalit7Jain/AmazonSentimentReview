My Amazon echo is amazing.  She tells me a tidbit of factual information or historical facts every morning when I tell her good morning.  She gives detailed weather information.  She details my work commute traffic.  She sets alarms for me, adds to my grocery list and plays all the music I enjoy.  I am still learning new things every day about Alexa and Alexa is also adding new things every day which is making her even more useful.  My favorite thing is being able to have her turn on and off my Philips Hue lights in each room.  And my other favorite thing is she gives me all of the Chicago Bears scores and updates
