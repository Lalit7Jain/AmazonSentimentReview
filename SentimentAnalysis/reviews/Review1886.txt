I absolutely love this product. I have mine in the kitchen so I can listen to music while I cook. It also comes in handy to set a timer, measurement conversions or any other questions you might have while cooking. The speaker has a great sound at all volume settings. When I had it play Ride of Valkyries to test the sound at volume 10, it was too loud for Alexa to hear my voice to turn it down. I had to do it manually. I didn't think this small speaker could do it.
