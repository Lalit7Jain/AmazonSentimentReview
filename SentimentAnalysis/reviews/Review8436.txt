How can you not love Alexa  i bought one for myself and one for my 81 year old mother I was concerned she would have issues with learning how to use the echo. {she just got the internet 2 months ago so its all new to her} I set everything up and to my surprise she not only loves it she has found a great skill i had not thought of trying she asks Alexa to spell words she has trouble remembering how to spell .
