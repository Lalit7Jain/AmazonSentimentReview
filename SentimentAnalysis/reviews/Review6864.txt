The Echo on the otherhand, is now an ESSENTIAL part of our Kitchen/Living room. I have it play whatever music is stuck in my head when I'm eating dinner thanks to its inegration with Amazon Music Unlimited. I set kitchen timers, play games with the roommates while we're conversating in the common area, ask it the weather before work in the morning, or even random trivial things when we're curious like an actor's age. The Echo responds very quickly compared to other voice recognition softwares, and has a much more pleasing voice. The speak is loud and rich!
