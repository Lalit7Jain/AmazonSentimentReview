I was raving about this thing until I asked Alexa to Play Candle In the Wind by Ed Sheeran a song I hadn't heard until ALEXA PLAYED IT.  I was able to ask her to play the song a few times after she initially played it, so my friends could hear it successfully but a few nights ago she said she couldn't find the song.  What!? very annoying I'm considering returning it.  Never heard of the song before I bought this thing now I'm annoyed she won't play it.  Am I going to like other songs she plays then arbitrarily "can't find"? Took my excitement for this item away pretty much.  I only wanted it for music although the alarm, timer, news, weather, and asking her to tell me a joke was fun its something I personally could live without.  Jury is still out on this one and I'm still within the 30 day return window I think....
