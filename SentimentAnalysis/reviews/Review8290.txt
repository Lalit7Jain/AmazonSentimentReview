I have both the Echo and the Dot.  They both work great and are great fun to have around.  We use them to play games....ask questions or turn the lights off and on...(with optional plugs).  She is like having a extra hand around the house.  She can sing and tell funny jokes.  She also help us to convert centimeters to inches!  Pretty cool.
