So Far So Good. I really don't have any big negatives to say, I mean Alexa struggles to understand some easy questions but other than that she does exactly what she is supposed to. Excellent sound quality and runs (specific) smart home devices, Highly Recommend the Echo for anyone looking for a bluetooth speaker that does more than just playing music.
