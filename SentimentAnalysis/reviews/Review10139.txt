I got my Echo today, and it's safe to say that I'm in love. For starters, Alexa is a Monty Python fan, because when I asked her, "What's the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?" ... well, she knew the right answer. She plays my favorite music, even making suggestions that are dead on. She knows the time, the weather, celsius to fahrenheit conversions ... and she'll wake me up from a nap, take dictation (shopping list and to-do list), keep track of my calendar, adjust my Nest thermostat and my Phillips Hue lights, and order me a pizza. She'll also bark at my dog (on command) and play music from my iPhone via Bluetooth.
