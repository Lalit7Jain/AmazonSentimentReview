Wow! We are really impressed! Setup is easy and Alexa is easy to understand, and more important, she understands us. If you want to refer back to what Alexa reported, a handy review list appears in the Echo app on your smart phone. She doesn't take up much space and she's fun to have around to ask questions about weather or trivia questions or to search lyrics or artists. Very happy.
