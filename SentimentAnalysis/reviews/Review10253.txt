Bottom line: For what Alexa does out of the box, it does it well. Skills are complete duds. If MUSIC or some type of audible media (such as books etc) is not your main use for this device, then you may want to consider twice before buying. Meaning, don't buy this to turn lights on and off...get off your butt and turn the lights on/off :/
