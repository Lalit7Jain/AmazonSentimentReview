I guess it's pretty cool but I am pretty disappointed in the sound quality, which is 90%+ what I use it for. Not any better than listening to the radio in my car. No bass at all, super flat. I wasn't expecting Bose quality but for the size and weight, I expected so much better. Love that I can listen to songs on demand via Amazon Music and Spotify, but I'm drying to bump it!
