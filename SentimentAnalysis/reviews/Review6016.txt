Obscure uses like that make me believe there's a ton of potential in voice assistants that hasn't been tapped yet. And currently, Echo and Alexa are even the voice assistant duo of choice for people like me who haven't fallen in love with mobile voice assistants. Do I depend on Alexa in the same way that I do my smartphone? No, but I'm perfectly happy with Alexa at home. She assists me with simple household chores and adds to my day with things like the Flash Briefing and easy music controls—and she does it without making me pause to interact with my phone. Confining Alexa to the home gives her a clear purpose. Because of that, fellow naysayers who have been skeptical of Siri and Cortana may actually enjoy talking to her, too.
