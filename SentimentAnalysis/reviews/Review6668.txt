I bought this mainly to stream music since I work from home. Having to deal with constant commercials and dj's from traditional radio became annoying. Not only does the echo allow me to stream music from various services including the prime music I get but having Alexa has become addictive for other things such as getting news updates, weather and traffic. I honestly don't know how I have managed to live without this device.
