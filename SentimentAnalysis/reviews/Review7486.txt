Echo is a fun gadget. Our family has played silly games with it -- like asking about the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow, then chuckling at the Monty Python-inspired answer. We've also asked about the weather, or used it to play selections on Spotify. I don't think it does much that you can't already do with a phone and Bluetooth speaker, but it works as advertised.
