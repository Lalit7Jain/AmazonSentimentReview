 I was a bit disappointed that she requires the  enabling of  "Skills"  to operate most functions.  And these enabled "Skills" require that  exact wording be used in order to get them to function correctly.  Which sometimes is difficult to remember.  If you don't get the wording right,  Alexa gives you grief until you do get it right.
