I loved my original echo so much I had to get another for my office.  The refurbished version was great and works perfectly.  It did not come with the remote like the original but at work I don't really need that.  The sound is perfect for my office and it takes up very little space. I just added a device on the phone app and it automatically knows which I am using.
