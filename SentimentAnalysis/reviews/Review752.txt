I never thought I'd say this about an Amazon made product, but today my Echo died after a lil over two years of being a pre-order Echo early adopter. Like every day, I asked Alexa to give me the weather forecast for tomorrow and.....silence. I knew something was wrong because Echo is always my faithful servant.  Although Echo had been stationary for years I still checked the plug, cord, AC outlet, surge protector and all was operable. As a last ditch effort I grabbed the defibrillator and stuck it in the reset hole several times and nothing.....no lights, no sound....nothing.
