So far I've had this unit for about 2 months and love almost everything about it and what it can do, although I'm sure I've barely scratched the surface of options! The sound on this is amazing compared to the echo dot that I purchased first. After trying out the idea with the dot I decided to invest in the more expensive big sister for the speakers as I listen to this while cleaning the house now. I'm not disappointed in any way. I will say for disclosure sake that I'm not a major audio geek that would normally pay a lot more for the "best" sound. all in all for the extra $ it was worth it to me! I've added several wifi outlets to my house and have it integrated with my thermostat as well. Now I'm catching the "bug" to look at where else I can integrate this into my home automation!
