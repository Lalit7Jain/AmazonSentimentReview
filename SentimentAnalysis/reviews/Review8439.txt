Okay, the Echo and I got off to a very bad start with it not responding despite multiple resets. After 6 days of genuine frustration, I finally deduced that just because your wifi is 5 bars strong, and every other wifi enabled device in the house works perfectly, it doesn't mean it will work with Alexa. From reading comments in forums all over the net, it seems that my Echo is not unique in it's extremely finicky utilization of available wifi. Ive finally resolved the functionality issue by relocating my router to a location that Alexa's rather open location approves of. (The router is now about 12 inches higher than it used to be on a shelf about 40 feet from the Echo.)  Alexa is now happily functioning 100% as advertised. Wifi signal strength is NOT a valid indicator that your Echo will function. If it doesn't work, try moving either the Echo or your router. Eventually you'll find a sweet spot. Once she has a signal she likes, she's amazing.
