We have really enjoyed our Alexa, however I wish it could understand regular conversation a little bit better. I've found that you have to be REALLY specific about what you ask it or she doesn't understand - sometimes it's quicker and easier to Google something than to try and phrase it properly so that she understands the question. That's the biggest downfall in my opinion.
