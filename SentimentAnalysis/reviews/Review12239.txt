Alexa is my new best friend. Funny jokes, weather reports, music, traffic, she's great. The one thing I can't get her to do is give me scores or any info on tennis matches. She can give me a definition of tennis, but has no clue about tennis tournaments. I can find out who won previousWimbledon or the U.S. Open. I really wanted her to keep me current with tennis. Unfortunately all I get is Hmm I don't know the answer to that.
