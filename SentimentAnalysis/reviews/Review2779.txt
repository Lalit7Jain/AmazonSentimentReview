When working it seems to work well, although you have to ask the questions just right or it doesn't have an answer.  We use it for home automation with Wink for lights and Nest for thermostat.  Home automation is a really nice feature.  The Echo seems to have problems disconnecting from the network randomly a few times a day.  We have an Echo Dot and we don't have much of a problem with it.  This picks up your voice from much farther away than I would have expected.  I recommend turning off the ability to order items through it.
