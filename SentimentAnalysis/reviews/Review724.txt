  Alexa help them with their homework. They play multiplication with her. My boy never fail to say "Good morning Alexa!"  Then Alexa answes with history or fun fact of the day. My four year old asked Alexa to play her most favorite song .. she said "Alexa always put sunshine in my pocket and good soul in my feet" ha ha !  I love that Alexa can also play some Filipino songs. My parent enjoyed that so much! I have to say Amazon echo is a very good investment. I will forever remember how my kids enjoy this wonderful electronic. Amazing creation of The Prime (Amazon)
