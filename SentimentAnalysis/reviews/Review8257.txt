Those are just the major issues Echo has as a music player. There are plenty of other missing features which should have been obvious when Amazon was creating this device. For example, Echo will tell you that it is learning constantly in order to improve its utility. Yet, you can't teach Echo a single thing. Even Apple's Siri will let you give it information which helps it be more useful. For example, I told Siri my wife's name. Now, I can say, "tell my wife we're out of carrots" and Siri knows exactly who I'm talking about, pulling my wife's details out of my contacts. I tried the same thing with Echo and got the far too common response "I don't understand that request."
