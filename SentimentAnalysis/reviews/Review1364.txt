Extremely disappointed.  I have an Echo & a Dot.  I should have returned them before the return period expired.  We have been trying for months to find some use for it.  Sometimes it can understand a simple question about the weather.  I hear it's great for ordering Amazon stuff, but I prefer to verify/compare prices before reordering anything.  I almost always have to go back to my Android phone and say "ok google" to get questions answered.  I cannot recommend this product and would like to return it.
