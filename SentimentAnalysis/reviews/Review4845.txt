Also, I have a trial with Amazon Music Unlimited.  They have an extreme selection of songs, but say I want it to play something quiet for relaxing it struggles to arrive at a particular genre.  Pandora is a much better service if you want prepared genres.  Echo is not a horrible product, but it needs a lot of work!
