The Amazon Echo is more an exercise in frustration than anything else.  It "sometimes" seems to be able to tell you the weather in a specific area, but little if anything else.  We got this thing, hoping that it might help us to learn Spanish.  Like "Echo, what is the Spanish word for FIRE".  It responds with "I don't know how to answer that" or "I can't pronounce that, but I wrote the translation for you" - So, this device is apparently an ENGLISH speaking only device.  Also, it writes the translation down in the Alexis app???  I don't want to read the word, I want to hear how to pronounce the word.  If I wanted to look up the word on my phone, I'd use Google, which is a 1,000 times better and more accurate - and can even pronounce the word - What use is Echo when I have to use my phone to get the answer anyway?
