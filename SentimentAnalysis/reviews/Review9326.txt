I love the Echo but there are some downsides.  The inability to select a name of your own choosing is annoying especially when you leave the default name of Alexa on it and then a commercial comes on for the Echo.  I have had her start playing music based on what the commercial was asking for.  I have two homes and have an Echo at both homes.  They are both tied to the same Amazon account which is fine but there is no way to differentiate them in the Alexa app so you can have different settings based on what's in the home.  For example when I ask for my travel time at one house it tells me the travel to the airport as I have set up in the app.  However when I am at the other house and I ask her the same question she gives me travel time from that house which is over 1500 miles away to the same airport and not the local airport there.  I also have Phillip Hue lighting in both houses.  The list of my light bulbs and rooms are always on the app for both homes so I can't have office as a room in both houses.  I have to have office in one house and then make up a code word for the office in the other house.  I can only hope that as time moves forward that the programmers take a step back and enhance what is already there to make it better instead of constantly adding new content without addressing concerns over the current issues.
