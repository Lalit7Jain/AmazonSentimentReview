Hello everyone I would like to write a review about my experience with the Amazon Echo I am very tech savvy and keep up with everything that comes to the market and I have  say I was very skeptical of this product at first but that all changed when I received the product because the Amazon Echo is absolutely phenomenal and I strongly encourage anyone who is wondering if it is worth the price to purchase this product because you will not be disappointed I can guarantee it I have had the Amazon Echo for a while now and use it absolutely every single day you might be wondering what I like about the Amazon Echo the most and that is the voice recognition that it has normally if you would like to listen to Pandora or set an alarm you would have to do it from your phone and sometimes that can be a pain but with the Amazon Echo that is all over because all you have to say is Alexa play Pandora and she will go to the last Pandora station you listened to or you can say Alexa play smooth jazz on Pandora and she will go to your smooth jazz station on Pandora and setting an alarm is a breeze with the echo just say Alexa set an alarm for 6 a.m. and that's it no more having to go through your phone to set your alarm anymore. And that is my review of the Amazon Echo
