Awesome speakers, voice recognition.  Functionality is good but you got to remember exactly what to ask to really unlock the potential.  Kids use it to listen to music and to get it to say funny jokes or play silly games.  Handy to check day's weather in the morning...hourly forcast woukd be better.  Also controls my wifi thermostate but really need something like instion syatem to unlock full potential.
