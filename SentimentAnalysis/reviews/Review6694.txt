Was a gift, 1 each for each of my adult kids. They all seem to enjoy it and one of them wants 2 more for their home. We have the full blown echo and it's really well built. Couldn't pass on these for the price though. Ordered another dot for upstairs so I can have wemo make my coffee before I get out of bed.
