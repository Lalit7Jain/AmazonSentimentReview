I also wanted to love this to replace my Logitech Squeezebox which was primarily used for internet radio and Pandora. The TuneIn Radio app constantly drops out and I have to resort to streaming on my computer. The fact that it also won't play the music stored on my computer (which the Squeezebox does) is a minus. Pandora works just fine so it's not a wifi issue but I'm guessing the TuneIn Radio app. Not at all happy. Maybe I'll just buy a new cord for my Squeezebox (which failed) and use it instead. Plus it's portable with the battery which the Echo isn't.
