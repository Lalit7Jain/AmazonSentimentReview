Very nice . Works well.  My  only complaint is that  you need to use the app a lot(Ex. Alexa, read me  my shopping  list" - "you can find your list  in the app")  and it seems it doesn't answer questions in as much detail as well(Ex. "Alexa, what is  the temperature  outside now", and you hear the day's forecast instead). I will admit I haven't worked with it a lot yet.
