I like that she's wireless and I can yell at her from across the room to play my Spotify music, but she's super inflexible. I can give commands like "play my starred playlist on Spotify," but I can't say "skip to True Faith by New Order," though I can say "play True Faith by New Order." It will play the one song and then stop. I have to tell Alexa every time I want to skip a song and that frustrates me because I can spend several minutes doing this.
