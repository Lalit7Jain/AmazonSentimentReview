Alexa is some thing you just can't live without.  From alarms to wake you with no blaring trumpets in your ear, to traffic updates, to music on Pandora to Jeopardy and tons of other fun applications, Alexa is just fun and very helpful..  I love that I can get up to date weather and even delays in the subways of New York or trains in Chicago...it's my favorite gadget and I look forward to even more applications, which seem to occur weekly.
