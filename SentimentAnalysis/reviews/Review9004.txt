TIP: In order to hear the professional narration that comes with your Kindle Unlimited books with audio you must say, "Alexa read 'name of book' from Audible". If you just say, "Alexa read 'name of book'" she will read it to you through text recognition. While a book is playing you can say things like, "Alexa pause" or "Alexa resume" or "Alexa go back 30 seconds" or "Alexa set sleep timer for 30 minutes."
