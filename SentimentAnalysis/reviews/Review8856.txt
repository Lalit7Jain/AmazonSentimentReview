For awhile, I kept hearing and reading about the Amazon Echo and I thought it was dumb. Why would anyone want this? It is just a speaker that you can talk to. I was not about to drop $180 on a speaker tube that I can boss around.  Then, Black Friday happened and I saw that the price had dropped to $140. At this point I still was not convinced but started to read all the positive reviews, comments, etc. I was just plain curious and decided that if I wanted to try this, I should get it now at a cheaper price. I slapped myself still. I still thought I made a stupid purchase! I DON'T NEED IT, yet I gave into all the ads and reviews -_-. I figured I could return it, sell it, gift it, something if I still regretted my decision when I received it.
