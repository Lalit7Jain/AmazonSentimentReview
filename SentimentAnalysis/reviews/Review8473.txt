just out of warranty and stopped working.  wont even turn on.  i bought this as a christmas present for my adult daughter last year.  was a good chunk of money to throw away. Other reviews say its not repairable. Perhaps i'll take a screwdriver and hammer to it and see if Alexa screams when dissection begins...and see what she was made of.
