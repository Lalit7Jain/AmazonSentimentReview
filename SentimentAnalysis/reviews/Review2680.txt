Layout of our house would not allow reasonable voice contact with the echo.  Hoped to use this great machine for my wife's meds  alerts so we wouldn't miss important events.  Only would work if we put it in her bedroom, thus limiting using echo for anything else.  So we have ordered the "little guy" for this use.  If it works out we likely will get a second hockey puck for the rest of the house.
