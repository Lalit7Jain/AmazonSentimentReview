we love our alexa, she always knows the weather forecast and can send my wife and kids off to work/school laughing at the joke for the day. .My daughter loves to play games with her and shes evolving very quickly to our requests. She can control our thermostats on both floors of the house. she can unlock the front door if a friend arrives and i'm in the shower. She can turn on lights programed to turn on together or can just respond to turn on one by one.
