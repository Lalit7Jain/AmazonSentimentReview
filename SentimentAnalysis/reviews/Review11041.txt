I am unhappy with its voice recognition such as simple things like play certain music or find distance or answer to a general knowledge question. Its also gets disconnected from Wi-Fi lots of times and is uanble to answer - so you will have to reboot - ideally it should have done that automatically when it lost connection to Wi-Fi!!!! Gee should have bought possible two version later; after all the refinements.
