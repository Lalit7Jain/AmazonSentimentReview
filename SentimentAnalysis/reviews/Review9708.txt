Just a tad problem setting up,but finally got it connected to the home computer,but not to either of the Kindle units.it would not download the app needed to operate and got a virus from the site,for the app,but once it was working with the computer,it worked perfect. Great sound,easy to get answers to all questions. Love it and made a gift for our son with another one and bought two of the Dot units for the grandchildren.
