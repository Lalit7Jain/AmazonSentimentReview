  My children love it so much, that I am getting the Dots for their rooms. They don't need the loud speaker that the Echo provides for their rooms. With the Dot, they will be able to enjoy the other functions of their very own Alexa in their own rooms. Such a fun gift and learning tool for  children. They are 10 and 13 and have no shortage of questions. LOL
