I'm having a blast with my new Amazon Echo!  I have used it to speel, OPPS "spell" words; check the weather; play music, specific music.  It is surprisingly responsive even from across the room.  I was impressed at how well it was packaged.  I was a little over zealous and didn't initially read the instructions so delayed my set up but once read, it was pretty straight forward.  YOU DO NEED INTERNET to use any on the ALEXA products (Echo, Dot or Tap) so if you are purchasing this as a gift, make sure the recipient has it.
