Disappointed in the Echo's ability to handle simple information queries. I asked what the proper water temperature was for brewing coffee, rephrasing about a dozen different ways, unable to answer, the same with "what sound does a chickadee make?" She said that she doesn't have the answer but could tell me what a cat sounds like. Also asked what deciduous trees are and where maple syrup comes from and the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy meaning of life. She couldn't find any answers. Thinking of going with the Google home for information queries.
