Bought the Amazon Echo for my husband for Christmas.  I love the sleek design and how it looks great no matter where we put it.  We were familiar with all it can do because my daughters each have one.  We are excited to be able to add the items to bring our house up-to-date with technology.  I love going to my daughter's house and all I have to do is tell the Echo which lights I want on.  I plan to be able to also do that with our Echo soon!
