Bought this a little over a year ago and it just stopped working. It was great until Alexa suddenly coukd not understand us and the blue ring turned red. Now the blue ring spins continuously. Tried all troubleshooting options and nothing has worked. I even called Amazon for help and nothing could be done. I think for the price, it should have lasted much longer. It was great while ot lasted.  I really want to give it a one, since it just stopped working for no reason, but we really loved it while it worked.
