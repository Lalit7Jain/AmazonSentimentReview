Great fun. Can be used alone, but is also a good gateway into home automation.  Very versatile and works well with a number of products made by various home automation system manufacturers.  I am currently using mine to control lighting, a main door lock, and an ecobee3 thermostat. If you are new to the Echo, I would suggest Googling it.  There are tons of reviews and YouTube videos out there about it.
