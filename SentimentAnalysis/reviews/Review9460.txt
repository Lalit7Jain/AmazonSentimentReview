The overall Sound of the Echo is not bad for background music or for a small area but would not be something you would want to use for a big area. I would recommend that if you already have an existing audio system and are looking for a great way to add music options and voice control than the Echo Dot may be a better choice as it allows hookup to an existing system whereas the Echo is designed to be a standalone speaker.
