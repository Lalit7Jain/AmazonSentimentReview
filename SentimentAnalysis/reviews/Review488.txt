My entire family and I are truly disappointed with the Amazon Echo and the Echo Dots.  It is an okay entertainment system, but when it comes to real questions, about 90% of the time we get the standard answer "I don't understand the question that you are asking."  It's funny how you put that same question on the various popular search engines and there are a multitude of answers.
