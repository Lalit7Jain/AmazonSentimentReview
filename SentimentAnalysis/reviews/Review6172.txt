I got the Echo for Christmas, and had to return it.  Initial set-up was bumpy with a snag during the connection to wi-fi, but I got past that.  The Echo worked well for about 1 day.  The next day, it was non-responsive.  According to the Alexa app, it was off-line for some reason.  So, I followed Amazon online technical instructions to trouble-shoot, which ran the gamut from powering off Echo, resetting Echo, to resetting my home wi-fi.  I Googled this error and found that it was apparently quite common.  What a shame that a device that's supposed to be smart and make our lives better and easier should be this complicated to set up and stay functional!  Amazon should take a hard and critical look at this product and consider withholding sales of this product until the technology is perfected and the kinks are ironed on. Connecting to wi-fi should be a very simple and basic things.  All my other "un-smart" devices had no problems getting connected and staying connected.  I'm extremely disappointed.  After wasting a few hours on this, I decided that this wasn't worth it and returned the product.  One more thing to consider is that I make a living with business-intelligence software development and I'm generally very tech savvy.  If a software engineer can't make this device work, what chances have the non-technical masses?  Again, deep disappointment with a product that has great potential but was poorly engineered and tested.
