My wife asked "Echo where's a good place for breakfast?", and it responded with "Carnation Breakfast Essentials" and "Quaker Instant Oatmeal" and "should I place an order for these two items NOW with amazon prime now?"  In the App, I've disabled "voice purchasing", but apparently Echo doesn't care, which was just another nail in its coffin.
