I don't like the Alexia.  I ask it a question and its answer more likely than not is "I can't find the answer for your question."  Then I go to google and find the answer myself.  Why do I have Alexia.  Also, don't like the fact that you can't return it if you don't like it.  We have had it less than sixty days and are finding it is an expensive weather service.
