This thing worked great for year, does a few specific things extremely well. A few months ago it started dropping connection constantly and now barely gets through one song on Spotify.  Consistently cuts out mid-song, had to stop using it as an alarm because I was late to work one day. I really want to like the device but I didn't spend $180 for a device to work for just a year
