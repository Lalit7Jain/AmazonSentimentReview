You would never know this item was refurbished by the way it looks and performs. Save some bucks and get a great item too. The Echo is awesome! Alexa is smart and accurate. The sound is amazing! Something so small that can pump out that kind of volume, all I can say is WOW! Listen to music, use as an alarm, order things on Amazon, play games and more. The only issue I have is not with Alexa but with Amazon Prime. You pay a monthly subscription and you don't get all the music. Many times I'm only given a sample or a crappy live version of a song, yet when you look at prime music you can buy it. Apple has all the music available for their pay service so why can't Amazon.
