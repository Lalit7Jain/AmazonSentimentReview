My Dots just arrived over the weekend and are, alas, are no where near as good at hearing the "Alexa" wake word or responding correctly to commands. I'll write a review of the Second Generation Dot in a few weeks after Amazon has had a chance to correct these problems, but at this point I have to say I am disappointed and may well return the lot of them.
