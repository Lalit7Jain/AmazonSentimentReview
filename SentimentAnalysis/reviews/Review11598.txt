So easy to set up it is scary, LOL. We have had the Echo about 1/2 a day - Alexa is already a part of our family! Our son has had one for quite some time and convinced us to get one. WOW why did we wait so long! It is amazing. Our computer will see a lot less use....We are not techies - this thing is so easy to set up; so easy to use, and down right amazing! Five stars does not do it justice! Should be 10. As usual amazon shipping was perfect.
