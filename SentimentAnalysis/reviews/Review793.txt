 This redefines voice io to a whole new level. Alexa understands me almost all of the time. Where my smartphone can't even get names in my address book correct, Alexa seems to have ESP! I could on and on and on. Just one more example: shopping lists. We use Alexa to record needed items at home during the week and then the Alexa app for our smartphones to check the list at the grocery store. It just works. Our phones claimed to offer a "family share" arrangement of lists, but what a huge failure. Amazon is light years ahead in the voice recognition arena. Can't wait to develop several skills for her... like "Walk the dog.!" {grin}
