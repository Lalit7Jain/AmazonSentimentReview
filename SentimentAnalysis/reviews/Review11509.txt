We had this product for over a year - we were one of the first ones to buy it, and actually used it;  but recently it fell over and the top popped off.  We could not find ANY information on Amazon or elsewhere on how to get it repaired, and so today I called Amazon Customer Service.  What a nightmare.  I spoke with multiple representatives who could not understand what I was saying and kept telling me that I needed help setting up the device.  It turns out that if the Echo is out of warranty, it's impossible to get it repaired.  I highly recommend not spending over $100 to buy a product that Amazon cannot repair for you and that no-one else can either.  I've been a Prime member for several years, and this is one of the most disappointing experiences I've ever had.  There isn't even a video to help us try putting it back together on our own.  Why build a product that no-one can repair?  Why buy it?
