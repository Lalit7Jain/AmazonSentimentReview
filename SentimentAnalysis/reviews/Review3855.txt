It is fun to ask Alexa what time it is, what the weather forecast is, and what the current news updates are.  You can ask Alexa to sound an alarm at a specific time.  But what I especially like is the ability to ask Alexa to create shopping and to do lists for you which are then readily accessible via the Alexa app on your phone or tablet.  In the past I used to keep a written grocery shopping list that often would be forgotten when I went shopping.  Not any more.  Since my phone is always with me I have the shopping list with me, too.  You can check off items as you gather them in the store, and the app will automatically delete them from your list.  The only thing I don't like is Alexa orders the items in serial fashion as you add them.  There is no way to shuffle the list so items in the same category can be clustered together.  It's a minor annoyance that makes grocery shopping with a long list less efficient.
