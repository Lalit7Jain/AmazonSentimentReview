The power cord! It would be nice if the Echo held a brief charge so that you could move it from room to room (bedroom, to kitchen in the morning) without it shutting down and then restarting. The restart process takes 30 secs or so, but still. A docking system would be cool.. if I had a docking station for it in multiple rooms and didn't have to shut it down when I wanted to change location in the household, well... that would be pretty cool.
