not gona give it a 5 star. i really liked it a lot at first. but the voice recognition has steadily degraded to be almost unusable. used to pick up everything perfectly. now i have to yell for it to even recognize me and then it doesnt understand what i say. buy the tap , portable , smaller , rechargable and now has voice activation. too late to get my money back on this purchase.
