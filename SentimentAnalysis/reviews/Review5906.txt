I loved my new Echo for the one day that it worked!  Since the day after Christmas it kept needing to be re-setup everytime I used it, until today when it stopped working all together!  After spending over an hour on the phone with Amazon Echo customer service they decided that the microphone was faulty and had stopped working.  They are sending me a new one but not until Jan 30th!!!  That means I have to wait 25 days for the replacement.  I am amazed that Amazon did not stock some for replacements when there is bound to be some number of defective units.  I consider that to be a poor customer service decision.
