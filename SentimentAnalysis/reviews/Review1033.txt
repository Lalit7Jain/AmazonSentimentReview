We don't use this quite as much as I had thought we would, but I still like having it around. The most used features for my family are: playing music through Pandora; checking the time; checking the weather; using as a timer; checking our Google calendar for events; adding shopping list items to our 'Our Groceries' app. We do have to be careful though as our 4 and 6-year-old kids have figured out how to add items to our Amazon shopping cart (fortunately, I haven't enabled the instant buy feature).
