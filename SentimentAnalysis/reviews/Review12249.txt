OK...now I am NOT happy.....love the Echo...BUT, hate that I can not download the Alexa App on my Android phone. Had it on there and LOVED having access to the app. But, I deleted the app by mistake and now can NOT download it again. Keep getting the message the app is NOT compatible to my phone. WHAT...really...it was in March. :(
