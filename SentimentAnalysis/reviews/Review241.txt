This unit has great sound. I also the the echo dot which I prefer. This unit can't hear anything. I have it in the same place my dot was, and it still can't hear. My dot is accurate about 98% of the time. This unit maybe 20%  . I use them for home automation, but most of the time just do it manually so I don't have to keep repeating myself. In my opinion unless you need big sound, get the echo dot.
