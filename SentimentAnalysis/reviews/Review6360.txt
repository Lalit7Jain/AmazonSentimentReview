I expected more. My mind wanders and I have a lot of questions, I got this thinking I won't have to use my phone to google everything and just say things out loud to get my answer, nope. Echo doesn't know most anything! If it does, it's through apps which you have to enable. Example, if you ask Echo how to make deviled eggs, it won't know, to get specific questions, you have to enable apps like AllRecipies and remember to ask Echo specifically in the lines of, "alexa, search all Allrecipes.com for deviled eggs", It's just too confusing! If you ask for today's news, you have to enable apps that has news, like ESPN or BBC, but you can only enable one or the other because it'll tell you news of the top enable app on your lists, so if you ask Echo for today's news and you wanted sports news yet BBC news in enabled first on the list, it'll give you BBC news and no sports!!! If I ask a question that's too tough or too much for Echo to answer, it'll say, I pulled up a Bing search link on your Echo App. I DON'T WANT TO USE MY PHONE OR LOOK AT ANYTHING! This suppose to be HANDS FREE! ECHO doesn't know ANYTHING! You have to use very specific word in order for Echo to recognize the responds to enable the specific app, for instance; You tell "Alexa, tell me a mama joke", she doesn't understands, then you say "Alexa start Mama Jokes", then she'll tell you to enable Yo Mama Jokes app, (which is already enabled) but in order for Echo to tell you yo mama jokes, you have to specifically say what the app want you to say in order for Echo to start using the app by saying "Alexa, start MOM Jokes (not mama)" then and only then will Echo start telling you a mama joke! FRUSTRATING!!!!!!!!!! There must be 1000 apps, I do not remember every key phrase to start the questioning!!!!
