The speaker is good, but other than that, this device is horrible. I have two echo dots that hear me perfectly but this doesn't hear me even when I'm standing next to it. It can't hear me over it's own alarm and if the volume is cracked up to 6 it can't hear me over itself playing music. This is a terrible design flaw and useless as an alarm. I'm so pissed that I spent so much on this.
