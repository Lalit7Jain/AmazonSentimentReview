I had my doubts about getting something so modern...but I love it!  It's great being able to find out the weather and have it choose different playlist according to my moods.  I love saying "Alexa...play happy music" and she does...really great!  Highly recommend it! And the sound is awesome!  Hard to believe it can sound so good coming from such a small speaker.
