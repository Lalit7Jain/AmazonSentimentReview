I love Alexa... I have twin 8 year olds and they ask me some pretty crazy questions. Having Alexa to answer the questions I basically was BSing the entire time is heavenly. I would give her 5 stars if she just listened to me when I speak to her. Oh and I have a two story house I hate I have to unplug her and carry her down stairs... can you tell I am SOOOO lazy!
