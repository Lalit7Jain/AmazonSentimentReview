At first we loved this item. However, now you must pay for features that were free.  We loved the free music feature which is no longer available.  This was the main reason I purchased this item. I feel I was taken advantage of by Amazon.  We purchased this item in January by March we could not access the music feature unless we pay for it.  I feel we were taken advantage of by Amazon. Basically this  $200.00 item is a piece of junk to us I have no desire to pay to listen to music.  I'm an Amazon Prime member that purchases almost on a weekly basis.  I do not think this is any way to treat loyal customers.  My reviews of Amazon are no longer positive.
