It was fun at first.  I bought it last year.  Since then it seems to "get" dumber and dumber with each upgrade.  For example, it used to do animal sounds in response to my grandchildren's requests such as "what does a dog say."  Now it just responds, "Sorry I only speak English at the moment."  When asking basic questions most of the time I receive "I don't know the answer but please check the bing page."  If I wanted bing I would simply look it up on my laptop.  We've asked "ok google" the same questions and received the expected response.  Alexa is pretty much just a cutesy speaker for music.  If that's what you want, buy it.  If you want what Amazon promises, get Google.  This is coming directly from an Amazon fan.  I will remain a loyal Amazon customer, but felt it only fair to warn people not to expect much with Alexa.  It's a waste of money.
