Even though my husband talks to Alexa like he's mad at her, she still does what he says:-)  I love the interactiveness of it all.  Alexa has become a great resource in our home.  From managing our shopping list to playing music on demand we have found Alexa very useful.  Alexa will lock my doors at night if I forget before I lay down for bed.  Alexa turns on a light on demand or a group of lights when we ask.  I am hoping to pair Alexa up with my Wink to run a 4-zone distributed audio system in my home.  One can wish...  Still researching.
