My experience trying to find a good Bluetooth speaker for the Dot has made me realize that the speaker on the full-sized unit is actually very good for the price. I bought and returned several Bluetooth speakers that cost from $60 to $200. I settled on the UE Boom 2 for about $180. The mid-range is better than the Echo's, but overall I think the Echo's sound is better than any of the Bluetooth speakers I've bought.
