Update: Ok, now that I've used the echo for several months, it seems to be glitching on a weekly basis now. Every so often, the timer (used daily) won't stop, no matter what I say. I have to press a button on top of the unit in order for the sound to stop. This also happened last week when playing music. Maybe the unit just needs to be restarted periodically like any computer. I will try resetting once every other week and see what happens.
