I never thought I'd love this thing so much, or use it as often as I do, but I now depend on it daily. I do my shopping list on it (which then goes right to a list on my phone), and I can stream my favorite radio stations from around the country (or the world) and listen to great music for free. This is kind of like the classic Star Trek computer, but with a better voice. Fantastic.
