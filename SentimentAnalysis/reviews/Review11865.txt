I love this unit but I am forced to give it less than perfect scores.  It has an amazing ability to hear it's name and respond.  It interacts with Amazon to play music flawlessly.  The unit has what seams to be intellegence but ask it to do something else and you need the manual.  It can send text messages but it requires a "through" phrase to porperly initiate the process.  I keep copies of these phrases on my phone to reference back the exact format.  The echo is a wonderful advance in technology.  Sound quality is good and it is a silent listener in your house.  This may be good or bad depending on your security concerns.
