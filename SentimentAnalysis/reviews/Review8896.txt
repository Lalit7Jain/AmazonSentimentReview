So far this has not been working great. First I cancelled my Google Music account and purchase a Spotify account to listen to music, since the Prime Music Library is so anemic with the current offering of selections. It works okay when you request it play an artist. But when you request a particular song that it was playing from the same artist, it tells you that it's unable to find that song (i.e Wale - Bad [remix] ft. Rihanna). Another example is telling it to play a song and it finds the song yet tells you it's unavailable (i.e. "Alexa, play Wale, Focused" is answered with "I can't find Focused. ft. Kid Cudi by Wale"). So it knows the song was featuring Kid Cudi (without me specifying so in my request), but yet it tells me it's unable to find the song? It's unfortunate that this product was not properly QA'ed before it's release into the market.
