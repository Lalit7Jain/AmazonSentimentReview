Alexa is terrible at answering questions; Hey Siri and Hey Google are much much better.  I often ask Siri questions via my phone, rather than doing an internet search and thought it would be great to be able to do the same with Alexa.  So far, she is zero for zero, other than asking her the time.  My questions are not that difficult.  Very disappointed.
