It's ok...probably not worth the money. It doesn't do much and appears to be programmed to only respond to certain topics & therefore cannot answer most things I request. Being able to input information for only one driving route is silly. Who only wants to know the drive time to one location? Multiple locations should be available to cover all areas that are frequently visited. Hopefully, new and more useful updates will occur ASAP. Rather large also so it takes up valuable counter space and isn't especially visually appealing.
