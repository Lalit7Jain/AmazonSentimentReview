This was a Christmas gift for my husband. He's absolutely obsessed. He uses it for everything from a timer to an alarm clock to playing jeopardy j6 daily to ordering stuff on Amazon to having it read him audio books..... Trying to stump Alexa by naming a random song to play (which he hasn't succeeded in doing yet) You name it, this thing can do it. Best money I've spent on a gift in a while.
