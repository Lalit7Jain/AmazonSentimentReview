I really enjoy this product. I do sometimes get upset about it not understanding my questions but then again it works good for a large room. Comes in handy for cooking. Just tell it to set a timer and it keeps you working what time it does it for you. Also good for music for the kitchen cleanup after you finish cooking with the prime music. Its a most have for a modern kitchen.
