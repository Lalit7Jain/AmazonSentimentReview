It's pretty much worthless unless you enable it's "skills" through the app.  Even then, a week later it has forgotten the "skill" and it needs to be re-enabled (which may or may not work). It remembers nothing, so if the power goes out - too bad, you have to redo the WIFI setup. Doesn't work with iTunes or Google Play Music which is where we purchase content.  We don't do our grocery shopping on Amazon, so not sure why I would make my grocery list on this thing.
