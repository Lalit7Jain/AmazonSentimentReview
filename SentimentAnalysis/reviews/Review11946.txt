Would have given the Echo three and a half stars if I could.  It is a good effort and has promise.  Voice recognition is a very difficult thing to program and understanding accurate context can be even more difficult.  I expect that Amazon will continue to improve the product in this regard.  My biggest complaint is its lack of ability to connect to and interact with my iPhone calendar, contacts, etc.  Given the large number of Apple product owners this is a surprisingly large gap in capabilities.  It is hoped that Amazon and Apple will push to quickly resolve this limitation.
