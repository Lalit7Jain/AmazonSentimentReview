CAUTION!!!  I sent the replacement back, got refunded, and ONE MONTH LATER was billed for not sending the device back.  I had proof I sent it back, and they are refunding me in 2 business weeks.  Unacceptable and should be illegal. I got $5 for my trouble, 20 mins searching for the UPS receipt, and 15 minutes on the phone with Amazon.
