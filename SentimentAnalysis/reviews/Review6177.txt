Great product. LOVE it. Alexa was easy to set up - practically plug and go.  You do need to go online and get the skills available. (Skills are like apps.)  She is quite interesting to "talk to."  She recognizes speech patterns and plays songs, turns on and off the lights (providing you've bought the Wemo plug.)  First thing daily she tells you the weather, news, turns on the lights. She can make coffee if you have the plug - another purchase.)  She will play music through home stereo system.  With Amazon Prime you get 250,000 songs or genres to play.
