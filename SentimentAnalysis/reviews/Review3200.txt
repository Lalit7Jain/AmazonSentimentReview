Oh, Alexa... let me count the ways. You sing to me, you give me news and weather updates, you help me remember things, and you entertain my family. My only wish, though... please don't be offended... I'd love to be able to change your name. Don't get me wrong, Alexa is nice... it's just that it's my sister-in-law's name. I like her plenty, but we had an awkward moment when she was visiting and thought I was asking her to add items to my grocery list.
