I LOVE HER! The shopping list option is seriously worth the price of admission. Best thing ever. I love pulling the last of something out of a cupboard/fridge and just being able to say, "Alexa, add X to my shopping list". Before I was using the Notes feature on my iPhone, which was great, as long as I could remember to go write down what I was out of. Sometimes I forgot. Now I can do it at the moment I know I'm running low/out and I'm golden. Best thing ever!
