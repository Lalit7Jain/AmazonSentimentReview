I really, REALLY wanted to love this. I purchased it on QVC because they offered a better deal. Unfortunately more than half the things Alexa is supposed to do, she does not. She cannot answer most of my questions. If I have skills enabled, and say one of the prompts advertised for that skill, she never understandable. I ALWAY  have to first ask her to open a certain skill to get her to let me use that skill, eliminating the hands free option, since I can't remember all the skill names. She claims to be a jukebox bit this feature has never worked for me. I  have music unlimited but when I ask her to play certain songs she either plays samples or can't find it. Again eliminating the hands free feature, because I have to go into the app to play the music. This is currently what I use her for mostly. To me the basics and she just won't do these things. Now she collects dust because most things I need her for she can't do. So far the best working feature is asking the forecast. I have had her for a few months and it has not gotten better.  I really wanted this to work...My husband wants to sell her because I essentially paid $150 for a speaker and to get the weather.
