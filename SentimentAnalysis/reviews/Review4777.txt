My sister-in-law had an Echo back in beta and loved it and promoted it to the max. I was blown away the first time it showed off with tremendous sound quality and Siri like capabilities. This Christmas she gave several as gifts and I've been using it at its most basic capacity. The alarm feature is wonderful and in fact I selected the Ferris Bueler wake up call as my preset alarm tone. I guaranty this is the most effective wake up alarm I have ever had and it shocks me awake to the point of not even considering snooze or going back to sleep. I've scratched the serface in what it can do beyond being a remarkable speaker platform with countless channeled and capabilities. My only complaint is that I play it at volume level 10 and although it boasts that it can still hear commands even through this volume of music I wind up screaming at her to change the channel or turn down the volume. I am excited to expand my base of knowledge and try some of the  peripheral devices to control lights and switches. It's to large to take as a travel companion and this is what now leads me to consider the Tap as my go-to blue tooth travel mate. With impressive sound quality and 9 hrs of charge range it may replace several of my blue tooth travel speaker wannabes. Over all you can't go wrong with this impressive Amazon product.  Amazon never ceases to amaze me.
