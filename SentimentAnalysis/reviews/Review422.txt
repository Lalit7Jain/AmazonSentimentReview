I love my new Echo, it is so handy to have to get info, especially the weather on the spot, and news briefs, and to play my music on demand, it wakes me up in the morning gently and is always ready to go. Installation was generally easy, but it took a few tries to get it setup on the Amazon server, busy, I think. Everyday there are new updates and the sound coming out of the speakers is very good. I recommend it. Delivery was fast and package was good!
