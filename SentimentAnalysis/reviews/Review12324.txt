My Echo with Alexa is on almost all day every day.  Love hearing my music!  The speaker is of very good quality as well. Think the sound may be better than my Bose Radio.  Of great importance to me is the"Ask My Buddy skill.  I live at Cypress Cove Retirement Center in SW Florida and would use this to alert Security to get help if, I happen to fall etc. in my apartment since I am alone.  Rather than having to wear an uncomfortable alert around my neck plus I am not having to pay each month for a service I may or may not use.
