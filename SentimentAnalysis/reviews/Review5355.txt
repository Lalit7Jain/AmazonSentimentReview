I have now bought three of these for family members. Bought one for my granddaughters' birthdays  to share and heard that they were always fighting over it. So their parents worked it out with them so they could each have it for a month at a time. They even bring it into the bathroom when they shower! Needless to say I added another one to their household for Christmas. Also bought one for my daughter for the holidays and she had it up and running before she was done with lunch.
