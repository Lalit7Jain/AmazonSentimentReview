There is almost no limit to what this little device can do!  It occupies a small footprint on whatever surface you care to put it on and does not draw attention to itself.  The internal speaker sounds good and leaves me desiring nothing else but I am no audiophile.  The microphones are sensitive enough to hear you with a quiet word but can filter out amazing amounts of extraneous environmental noise even if you are speaking from across a rather large room.  It deals with echoes from nearby surfaces very well and has not missed a single command yet.
