This device works flawlessly and has incredible sound for the size and price. I use it with the Echo only Amazon Music Unlimited service. The price of $3.99/mo for Amazon's entire music library is an incredible value. Back to the device: it is well built and feels sturdy enough. I have it mounted with an aftermarket wall mount and the 360 driver still fills the room with sound.
