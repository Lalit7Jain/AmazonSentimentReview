We are really enjoying our Echo - it is so nice to ask Alexa to play music, etc., check movies, etc. We are still learning all of the features, but so far, so good. It arrived in plenty of time for Christmas. It sits on our kitchen counter and really, the speaker sounds great, a good bit of bass sound. I have an iPhone and a Pandora account, for example, so I wanted the Echo to play some of my Pandora music (I have Amazon, too, and Amazon Prime which I HIGHLY suggest getting as it is a good deal), anyway I loaded the Pandora APP to my iPhone first, then Alexa was able to recognize and play my Pandora music. The setup is very easy/simple just plug in and go (you of course need your WiFi).
