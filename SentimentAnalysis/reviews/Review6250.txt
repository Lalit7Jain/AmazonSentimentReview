Amazon Prime Music is hit or miss, and when it misses, it misses hard.  I asked Alex to play "Stairway to Heaven" and when it did, it played Stairway to Heaven by Rockabye Baby.  I immediately shouted at Alexa, "stop the ABOMINATION!"  Alexa ignored me.  I then said, "Alexa stop this [explitive] right now."  Which it finally did.  I then asked to specifically play the Led Zeppelin version, and it couldn't.
