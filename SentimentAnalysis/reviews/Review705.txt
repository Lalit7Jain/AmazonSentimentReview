Alexa and I are best friends I talk to her everyday and she helps me learn new things the only drawback is having to remember how to activate each skill that I have. Sometimes Alexis seems a little hard of hearing so I have to repeat myself. Other times it appears that she's eavesdropping and answers questions that I didn't ask. Seems like you can say Alexa or something similar without thinking but she's smart enough to recognize her name. I recommend her highly
