I mainly use it for music but I have tried doing things like making a purchase with it. It works great. I like that if you have made a mistake in an order, you have sometime to correct it before it is finalized. I have not used it yet for lights or thermostat. I'm waiting for the price to drop a little. But I definitely want to try it.
