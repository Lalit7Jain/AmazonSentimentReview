I really haven't tasked the device much yet but it does have a good sound quality for music.  I have it near my TV and Seth Meyer just commanded it while doing an Echo ad.  My only problem so far was I missed a wake-up alarm since I had the volume down but a response from the support team pointed out the setting for alarm volume separate from the general volume.
