I bought this to play music, but the sound quality is meh.  Not horrible, but not nearly as good as $179 would expect.  Alexa is neat, but I haven't really found anything that I really want to do with her.  I have some home automation, but yelling across the room seems silly, especially with loud kids running around.  I have had Cortana for a while and find myself not using that much either.  Maybe I just find it weird talking to a device when there are people in the room.
