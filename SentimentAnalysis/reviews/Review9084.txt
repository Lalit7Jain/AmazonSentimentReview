This product is one of those items that you like & dislike at the same time after the initial novelty wears off.  While it can be very convenient, it also can be very frustrating.  I often find myself having to provide precise music titles or exact news station requests; yet, half the time, all I get back is  "Humm, I can't find that answer or I don't understand the question?"
