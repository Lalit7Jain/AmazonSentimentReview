I bought my echo over a month ago from best buy but I did not decide to attempt to take it back until it was past the period to get a full refund. Thru out this time I have attempted to work with it. I bought it to listen to my amazon playlist which it does not do on a regular basis. I wake it up and most of the time the light does not stay on long enough to hear my request and if it does it circles around and doesn't play anything. when it does play its great but most of the time its just a bad ideal that is too expensive to through away.  I then use my radio. So if you do decide to buy one and it doesn't work take if back to get your refund.
