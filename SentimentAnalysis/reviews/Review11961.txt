We got our Echo in Dec 2015.  It failed a few days short of its first birthday and Amazon cross shipped a replacement.  We have enjoyed playing with Alexia and using the Echo as a music player.  But a few days ago it started playing a very energetic march at very high volume.  pressing the control buttons on top made the light change color but didn't stop it.  "Alexia stop" or "Alexia quiet" didn't stop it, either.  The remote control had no effect, either.  Unplugging it worked, of course.  That does it as far as we're concerned.  Just too wierded out!
