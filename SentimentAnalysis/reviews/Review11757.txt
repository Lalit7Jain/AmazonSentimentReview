My family absolutely loves the Amazon Echo!  We use it primarily to play music for the entire family, and the quality of the speaker is fantastic.  Our three year old daughter has already become an expert at asking "Alexa" to play certain songs and to set a timer.  The "skills" continue to improve; although we have not taken advantage of skills like the shopping list as of yet.  Well built product, easy to use, and fun for the whole family.  We are very happy with our purchase, and would highly recommend the Amazon Echo.
