If you are looking for a personal assistant or something to answer even basic questions, you will have to look elsewhere, like Cortana, Google or Siri.  The Echo has been able to correctly understand and answer only a small percentage of the questions we have put to it.  And the answers it gives are dreadfully terse.  If it understands your question (the 1st hurdle), then you are still more likely to receive a "cannot find an answer to your question" (2nd hurdle).  If you do receive an actual answer (to the question you actually asked and not some other thing she thought you said) then your response will be extremely limited; just a sentence or two usually.
