It's hard to rate a product own it's own without rating the services it's locked into.  I'd like to see Groove Music, Google Music, Slacker and Sirius XM added, especially since the first two offer significantly more storage than Amazon, without nickel and diming. Also, the fist two have no restrictions to allowing Amazon into their platform (Android and Microsoft).  For audiophiles, I think Groove is the winner, simple because you can encode to the highest bitrate wma, and encode to a lossess format.  So if you're an audiophile with a massive CD collection, or massive FLAC collection from other means (I won't judge), Microsoft is probably the way to go.  I have no idea how good the Xbox One is at playing Lossless WMA and high bitrate WMA files. I'd have a hard time imagining an audiophile even considering streaming their own library, but I guess the X1 would be the way to do it?  Assuming they didn't already have something more sophisticated in place.
