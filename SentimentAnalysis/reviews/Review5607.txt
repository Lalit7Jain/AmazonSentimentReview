First, let me say that I have no qualms or quibbles with the Echo device itself – it’s great.  But the support and part replacement side is challenged.  The AC/DC power adapter died on my Echo.  This was obvious in that none of the LED lights were lit and the unit would not respond.  I tried different outlets, unplugged the adapter and left it unplugged for days, pressed the reset, etc., all to no avail.  I finally got out my VOM multimeter and tested the DC output from the plug on the power adapter – dead!  I contacted supported, let them know all that I had done and their response was to ask me to call in (or let them call me) to troubleshoot.  When I repeated that I had already diagnosed what was wrong, they again stated we needed to speak on the phone so they could determine what lights were in what state.
