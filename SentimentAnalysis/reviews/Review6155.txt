My brother bought this for me to help make life a little easier in some simple ways. The shopping list is awesome. For 6-8 weeks my unit worked beautifully. Played music every time I asked. Did everything I asked. Then, it stopped playing music altogether. I called. Customer serviced called right back many many times each time saying it was something wrong with the wifi at home or the operator. When I suggested exchanging the unit the idea was dismissed. "The team is still working on your issue" Then "the team" suggests exchanging unit but I have to call. So I call. Now I need all the private info about the giver of the gift- which wouldn't be such an issue except my brother is deployed across the world and 5 time zones. Would not recommend this product nor the customer service. That being said, those I spoke to were always kind, polite, and easy to understand. That is certainly appreciated. However, the fixing of the problem saga continues....... UGH!
