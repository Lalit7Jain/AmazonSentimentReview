Purchased this product because it seemed like the latest and greatest hype.  AND BOY IS IT EVER!!!!  It's literally fantastic.  It has increased my overall daily productivity ten fold.  Sounds fairly good, not for the audiophile, but for everything it does, the sound quality is A-OK.  Sings happy birthday in probably the most soothing voice imaginable.  Truly fantastic.  Use it every day.
