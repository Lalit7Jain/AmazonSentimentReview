Actually I got this for my mother, thinking she might enjoy, but she was disappointed that it didn't know much when she was asking questions, the weather wasn't hour by hour and the alarm/time wasn't very audible while music playing.  She is 80 so I did set up Ask My Buddy. I think she likes having that in case she's not near a phone. I'll give it a bit more time and if mom isn't using it, I may just sell it. I really don't have the need for it to keep myself. I told her I'd get her a outlet switch so she can use Alexa to turn on/off her lamp. Maybe that might be helpful for her....guess we'll see. I'm getting her one to try for Christmas.
