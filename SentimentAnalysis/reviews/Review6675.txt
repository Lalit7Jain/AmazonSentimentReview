I got my Alexa from my brother for my birthday and I have now purchased for my daughters birthday which unfortunatelly his on back order- but she loved mine so much! -Even my 2 year old granddaughter was going up to her and staying Alexa play "let it go" and Alexa said I like the polite way you are asking!!!!
