In most ways, the Echo is impressive. But once you start using it for any period of time, you start to get irritated with it's lack of ability to find or explain anything. When looking into it, I found that it's because it's search engine is bing. There is no way to switch this to google. I will be replacing this with a google home, because it's search engine isn't complete garbage.
