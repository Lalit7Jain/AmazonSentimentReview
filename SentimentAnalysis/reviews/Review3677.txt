This is one of the best products I have purchased in this decade. PLEASE, develop a digital bulletin board to go with the Echo. A touch-screen with the ability to swipe between calendars, message boards, weather, household files, photo slide shows (as a screensaver) with an infinite number of functionalities to go in your kitchen as an information hub. THIS WOULD MAKE A KILLING!
