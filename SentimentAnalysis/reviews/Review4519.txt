First of all the Echo has different commands, called apps, that you can install for it.  One of which is a cat meowing sound....I have 2 cats who are highly territorial and i enjoy messing with them from time to time.  Typically I use a application on my smartphone to make fake cats meow, and they come running over to me concerned that their favorite spot on my lap will soon be lost.  I get two cats who are extra lovey, warm, and purring to cuddle with and we all win.
