I purchased the echo for my wife as a birthday gift. she loved it , but never used it my kids use it for homework, listening to music. My oldest was baking and Alexa read out a recipe, and in the end Alexa is useful, very cool . I purchased one and use it as a home automation platform with SmartThings. it works flawlessly
