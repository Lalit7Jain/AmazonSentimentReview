Bought this for a present for family but when they received one from someone else I decided to keep for myself instead of sending it back.  I am so happy I did.  Thought it would be a fun electronics to have but didn't think too seriously about the practical side of having it. Now it is my go to time teller, weather announcer, music player, wake up alarm, and general question answerer.  Not sure I would want to do without it. I especially love it when I have one song on my mind that I want to hear and don't want to dig through my favorite lists to find it.  I just ask Alexa for it and within seconds I am enjoying it. Will I ever buy and hook up light switches and heat and air controls to it - doubtful; but do I truly enjoy the fun of immediate responses to questions for time, temp, info and music - you bet!
