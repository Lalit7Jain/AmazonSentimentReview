This Amazon Echo is absolutely amazing! At first I was skeptical about buying, since I usually wait until the future generation of that product is released. I went ahead and purchased anyways, and haven't been happier with my decision. The Alexa feature is amazing it's very clear when responding to you. I was also very impressed on how far away you can be from it while still speaking to the echo. The speaker is also very crisp and loud. The features that can be used with the echo make it worth the money. I have my smart lights connected to the echo, and can have them turned on and off just by speaking to it. I would highly recommend this product.
