I think this will be a great product in the near future, but now, it is so limiting and incorrect, we returned it.  We asked for a weather report for our location and the response was "sunny and 95 degrees".  Our local weather and our weather radar were both warning us about major thunderstorms on the way.  Another disappointing question we asked was to name the football team our team was playing that day and the only response we could get was the schedule for the following week.  I will say it has great speakers but limited in the music you can connect for now.  I expect that to expand.  We bought too early.  We will take another look at it in about a year.
