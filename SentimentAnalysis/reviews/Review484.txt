This is one of those items that makes you lazy.  Occasionally it'll lose WIFI connectivity and I have to turn the light switch on like its some kind of hassle! One great thing is that my flood light switch is upstairs and my FRONT porch light switches are in a remote foyer.  I just have to say "Alexa, turn the outside lights on" on my way out the door and there it is!
