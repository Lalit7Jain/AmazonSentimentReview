I purchased this when it was first offered by Amazon, It has sat in the same place in the kitchen on the counter, has never been moved, never been knocked over ( don't have pets or kids).  in late 2016 I noticed the top of the device was kinda sticking up, and when I inspected it, I found that the top ring that has the buttons on it, was loose.  I found that the top was held in place by screws up from the inside and they had broken free.  When I inquired as to why this happened and if I could get it fixed I was told that no I would have to buy a new one.  The unit works fine just the top ring is broken.  So thus the less than stellar review.
