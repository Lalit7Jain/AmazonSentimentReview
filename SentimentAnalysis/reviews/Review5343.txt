2. "Skills???!!!":  If you ask Google Home any question, the device will literally Google everything for you.  Instead, for Echo devices, you have to add "skills" to enhance its functionality.  ....What???  I was hoping that devices like Echo will already come with all the common skills.  BTW, most of the "skills" are garbage.  I don't know about you, but I am more interested in this device knowing the answers to the practical questions, than telling me about baseball trivia.  And many "skills" published for Alexa has 1 star ratings.  They literally look like someone picked up a coding manual and coded them.  As I mentioned earlier, Echo had 2 years of product maturity time, yet in so many ways, it lacks.
