I couldn't really tell you how well Echo works considering I spent hours trying to set it up. It will not connect to my wifi. It won't even try. I have searched Amazon and watched YouTube videos and nothing has helped. Very disappointed. I wouldn't have a problem sending it back and trying a new one but Amazon is out of stock until the end of January. Not happy.
