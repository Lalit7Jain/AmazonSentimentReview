When you first set up Echo there is a list of words you have to speak so it can learn your voice and inflection.  This takes only a minute or so.  After doing so it does an amazing job of recognizing speech commands.  When I have spoken clearly it has yet to miss a command.  The only mistakes it has made was when I accidentally misspoke.  I don't have a thick accent, though, so others who do may have a different experience.
