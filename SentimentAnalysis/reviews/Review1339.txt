I waited to leave a honest and fair review, I wanted to get past the hype and the ravings of my friends to find out what Alexa can do for me ms Average a non Amazon Prime account holder.  Great for news and weather, quick checking facts, shopping lists and timers for cooking, radio stations.  Music well you might end up spending more to join Amazon music, I use Spotify managed to work how to make it work on her myself, audio books... again join as a prime if you want that function.  I don't need her turning lights on, etc
