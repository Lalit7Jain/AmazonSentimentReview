The Amazon Echo is a great product for the entire household. The Echo platform is a great platform to use and is very user friendly. I give this product three stars for a couple reasons. The first is price. The echo Dot blows the echo out of the water in comparison to price. You can get the same thing minus the speaker for a third of the price. Yes the speaker is far better then the dot but the option for an external speaker is a feature that the Echo lacks.  Number 2 size. Because of the speaker the size make's it hard to place. The dot is slim and easily put on a desk or can be hung on a wall. The echo however must sit on a flat surface and limits the options you can place it. I still love echo but would buy the dot if I could do it again.
