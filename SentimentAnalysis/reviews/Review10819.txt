The Echo out of the box has a few useful features such as inquiring about weather, news, sports, shopping lists, random trivia, playing music.  It's greatest appeal to me would be it's connectivity with controlling smart appliances (such as your thermostat, lighting, TV and other gadgets).  I've always wanted a, "Home of the Future", where I could simply say voice commands to get results.
