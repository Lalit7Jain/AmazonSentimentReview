I watched a commercial for Google Home Device and a daughter asked her father what sound does a whale make and the father asked Google Home Device.  Google Home replies with whale sounds.  I thought this would be a good way to test my Amazon Echo and I asked the same question.  Amazon Echo replied "Splash".  Not what I was expecting.  More work is needed to enhance the Echo.
