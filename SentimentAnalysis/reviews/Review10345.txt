Amazing!  This is so much fun and so practical that I can't believe I never had it before. My family just loves it too. Can't wait to order a pizza with it. There was a bit of a learning curve but not much. Plus if you google "echo" lots and lots of info out there. I highly recommend this futuristic machine.
