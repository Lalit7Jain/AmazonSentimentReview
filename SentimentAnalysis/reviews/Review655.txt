I have to start off saying that I liked the 5-month payment plan and believe it or not I am one of those people that don't have a cell phone which I plan to buy later this year. I did buy the apple iPod touch ( to use for my walking ) and I was able to download the Alexa app on the iPod and connect it to my Wi-Fi it is great I just love it. So if anyone is on the fence about this item do your research ( read reviews etc.)  and buy this because you won't be disappointed. I am still discovering everything the Echo does and in closing, <U+200B>I hope my review helps you in buying this item and if you do have fun with it because I know I do.
