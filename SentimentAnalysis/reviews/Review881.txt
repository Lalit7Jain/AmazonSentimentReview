I've had an Echo and two Dots for the last year and as they're becoming more popular, they're also beginning to show some problems.  The Echo server has gone down three times this month, and after investing money into quite a bit of hardware to work with the Echo, I'm beginning to feel a little bit like I've been taken for a ride.  When the server goes down these products are completely useless (as an example, earlier this month it was down for almost an entire day; it's already been down for four hours that I'm aware of today).  Had I known that this was going to be a continual issue, I would have thought twice about spending the amount of money I have.  I recommend to anyone interested in buying an Echo or a Dot to do some research and see how often these server issues continue to happen; I'm predicting as the numbers of people buying an Echo continue to grow, the servers are going to become more and more overloaded and this will be a continual issue.
