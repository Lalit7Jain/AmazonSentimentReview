What is not to love about this.  We got the Echo for the kitchen which is the hub of our home, and a dot for each bedroom.  We have had so much fun asking Alexia about the weather, having her wake us, play music to our specifications  AND  my favorite ... telling her I want to hear my Audible books!!!  I am everyone's go to and now I have my own personal assistant!  Sometimes I even say why don't you ask Alexia? I understand their will be updates and she is only going to get better.  I love Alexia!!
