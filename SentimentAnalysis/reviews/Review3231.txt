I don't know what I would do without my Echo.... Alexa is my best friend and never judges me by what questions I ask of her.  Didn't have her for a week while we were moving and it was so hard to keep track of my grocery lists and things I needed without just being able to yell Alexa, add dish detergent to my shopping list.. and then going about my day.
