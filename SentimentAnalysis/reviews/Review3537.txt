Had a little problem with may ECHO and had to contact Customer Service!  From day one ALEXA would not respond to any request without pressing the button on top!  However, it would respond to friends speaking to it over the phone and YouTube videos on how to operate ECHO!  Customer Service checked out ECHO remotely and gave her a clean bill of health!  They then asked me to move the ECHO closer to my router and it began working as normal!  Turns out I had it plugged into an surge protector/outlet that was on the same electrical circuit as a microwave, television, DVD Player, and a Sound Bar!  The operation of the microwave was affecting the ECHO even when the the ECHO was not in use!
