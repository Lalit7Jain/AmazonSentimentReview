Overall, great for playing music. Speaker is fantastic. Alexa gets a bit confused at times when there is a ton of background noise (think adult, kid, both asking questions with a dishwasher in the background, a tv, and another kid screaming....its a bit too much- can't say as I blame her on this one).
