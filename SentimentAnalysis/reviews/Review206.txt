Anyone who owns one of these really does need to check out the skills occasionally to see what new things are available because more and more are appearing all the time.  Some skills might be used more than others but half the fun in an Echo is exploring just what it can do.  I have not enabled any of the ordering aspects and don't plan to but it is nice to be able to ask Alexa where my latest order from Amazon is.  There are improvements being made to the whole system all the time and I'm definitely having fun with it. :)
