Come into the new century! My high-end stereo began to die. I realized the music world has moved on beyond my vinyl, 8 track tapes, cassettes, and cds. What happened while I was sleeping! Now, you don't even have to buy the media. I purchased this, along with the "unlimited" music package from Amazon for something like $3 a month. This is great!. The sound from the small speakers does NOT compare with vinyl through a really nice system, but it is good enough. I keep trying to find music that Alexa doesn't have, but in one month, I may have "stumped" her twice. Aside from checking the weather, I don't use this for anything other than music.
