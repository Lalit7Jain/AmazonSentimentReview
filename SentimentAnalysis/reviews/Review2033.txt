Basically, I wanted to achieve three things from the Echo: 1) Listen to music while I was cooking, 2) Use it as resource for getting facts and information (I have two very curious young boys), and 3) Help me with organizational items (shopping w/Amazon, calendar functions, timers, weather, etc.). The result? Items 1 and 2 hugely disappoint. Yet, item 3 was surprisingly good.
