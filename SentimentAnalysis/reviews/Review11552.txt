We are crazy about Alexa. I use her for shopping lists, asking random questions, setting cooking timers, and listening to music. The kids ask for jokes. She knows when our teams play and what the score was. She knows the weather for tomorrow. Even my normally tech-resistant husband uses her constantly.  And she only gets smarter. It's like living with Jarvis. . . or Hal. By the way, be sure to ask her to open the pod bay doors.
