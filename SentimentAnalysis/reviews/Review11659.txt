I did subtract 1 star, which I might even go back and add it back. Alexa has trouble hearing sometimes, especially if playing music. I'm from Louisiana, I have a country accent. Sometimes she doesn't understand what I've said, but does a great job most of the time. Some songs I guess aren't on Prime Music yet so there's been a couple of times I've said Alexa play and she's said its not in your music library.
