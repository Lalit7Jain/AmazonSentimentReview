I purchased an Echo when it was only available to Prime Members.  It has improved over the years to a fully functional assistant.  I use it so much, I purchased a second one for my office.  I always think I am going to remember something but then I don't.  Why don't I just use Outlook to organize?  Because it just seems like so much work and sticky notes just get gone.  I just add a reminder to my to do list or calendar and let Alexa take care of the rest.  I don't use my Echo to its full potential but she keeps my calendar, reminders, grocery list.  She impresses co-workers with her ability to answer a question pretty efficiently.  She turns the lights out when I'm to lazy to get up and turns them on when I leave during the day and get back after dark.  She reads to me from my Audible account.  I use her to place orders.  Okay, I am a little lazy, Echo just makes it less obvious to others.
