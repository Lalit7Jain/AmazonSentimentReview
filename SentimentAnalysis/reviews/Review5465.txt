Look ma, no hands!  I don't think I warmed up to voice commands as quickly as I did with the Echo.  I've had an iPhone since the very first edition (not every one, I typically skip a model), but never warmed up to Siri like I did with Alexa.  I'm still exploring all the things this can do.  We've since added to our collection with another Echo and a Dot.
