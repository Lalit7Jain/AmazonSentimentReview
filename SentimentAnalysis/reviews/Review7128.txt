Alexa is awesome. I'm too lazy to Google things nowadays, and she does it for me (with pretty good accuracy, although she did tell me that Sam's Club was open [on a non-holiday] later than it actually was... that's 10 miles that I'll never get back :)  ). The Echo/Alexa are great with weather, have EXCELLENT sound quality (for such a small device), and the alarm system is the reason that I make it to work... with 3 minutes to spare :)  . That's progress, people!
