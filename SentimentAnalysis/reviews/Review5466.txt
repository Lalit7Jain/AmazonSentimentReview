I received my Echo as a Christmas present last year (2015) as a novelty. As Alexa's abilities improved I started using the Echo for day to day activities.  On 1/5/2017 the dog his my end table 24" high and our friend Alexa fell off of the table.  Needless to say she no longer powers up.  I am posting this review as to describe the poor quality electronics this device contains,  I have had cell phones, televisions, lap tops etc. fall from higher without disruption or breakage. I would have thought this product, designed to be displayed on a table, would have held up better.  For those looking to buy this product, I can attest to the functionality as it works well; just don't let anything happen to it and put it in a protective case. Upon notifying Amazon their customer service was poor at best. After describing the incident I was left with the comment "ok", I was actually surprised at the lack of concern.  She offered 10% off of a new Echo, needless to say I didn't place an order.  I would have expected a product, which isn't cheap, would have been manufactured to withstand a drop off of a table.
