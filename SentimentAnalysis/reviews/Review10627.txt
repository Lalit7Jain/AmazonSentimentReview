Initially I only used it to listen to music or to entertain friends by asking it silly questions. Now I use it mostly to listen to Audible books while painting (I'm a professional artist) or to get daily weather reports. However, I wish we could change to name to something of our own choosing. My daughter's name is Alexis and whenever I said her name the Echo would turn on! I finally was able to change the wake word to "Echo" but my question is-why call it an Echo then name it Alexa? Really dumb move. Other than that, I really love it. I am continually finding new ways to use it.
