The Echo/Alexa has some down sides. Her understanding of the spoken word is less than perfect, so sometimes I wind up having really odd thngs added to my shopping list, like "toilet cleaner ducks" instead of "pucks." Conveniently, the Alexa app allows you to listen to the actual command you gave while browsing the poultry section for toilet products so you can re-direct yourself to the cleaning products section. She also responds and tries to interpret personal conversations when she hears or thinks she hears her name. (We have a dog named "Lex," so this pops up from time to time, as do conversations about the Echo itself.)
