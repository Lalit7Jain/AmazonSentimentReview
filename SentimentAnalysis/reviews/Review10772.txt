Really amazing product! The only criticism is I am unable to access my calendar using Echo. I have an iMac and my calendar is kept on iCal. Alexa can't access this information and can only link to Google Calendar. When I attempted to sync iCal with Google Calendar, using iCloud, Alexa was still unable to tell me if I had any appointments scheduled. This is a major shortcoming that needs to be addressed by Amazon in order to make this a truly valuable product.
