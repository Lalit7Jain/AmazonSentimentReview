When Alexa came into our home, my wife asked why I bought it.  Since I had no personal experience with the Echo, I answered, "Because it's cool".  Voice recognition technology has been around for 20+ years - and it's always been a bit 'hit and miss', in it's effectiveness - lots of 'learning' involved for most devices.  Not so, with Alexa and the Echo, from day one, commands were generally understood - and my wife is just as impressed now, as I am - we use it to create shopping lists, to do lists, get news and sports updates, in addition to the music.
