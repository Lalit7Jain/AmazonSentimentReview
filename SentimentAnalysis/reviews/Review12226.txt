Plan to introduce her to ECHO - the fact she can ask questions - especially weather and news - along  with many other pieces of info and will be able to access her Google calendar. She and her husband provided our three county area for many years with all the "Mighty Wurlitzers" jute boxes t and the "platters" played in bars and restaurants - will so nice for her to be able call up "old familiar tunes."  Currently for her books for the blind she uses a tape reader from the Blind and accesses  thru learned behavior by feel - hopefully we will be able to bring her stories thru the ECHO - using the Blinds books and using the Library of Congress and Montana State Library.
