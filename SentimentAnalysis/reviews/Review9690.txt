I should say I loved it --then she died. Just over a year and I feel it should have lasted longer than that. When we contacted Amazon they had no help or options because it was over a year-No we did not have an extended warranty-Just didn't think it would be necessary as we have had other Amazon products and had no issues. They did offer a small credit toward a new one but..again it only lasted a year..not sure we want another. Also have a Tap for about 6 months now and have replaced it already. Have been Prime member for years but this has left us very unhappy.
