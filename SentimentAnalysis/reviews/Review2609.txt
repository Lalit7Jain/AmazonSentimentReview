Just bought it Christmas of 2016, but bought it before it was marketplace ready.  It is interesting to speak to it about items or events.  However, trying to get items like CREE, Philips light bulbs to work, Garageio door openers, Skybell video doorbells, and other simply cool items to work; simply don't.  Being in the IT business, there is little we cannot do.  However, some of this stuff just does not work in prime time yet.
