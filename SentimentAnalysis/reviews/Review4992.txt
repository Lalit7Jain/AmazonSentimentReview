Love. Easy to set up and operate, fun to use, quite entertaining.  Given as a gift to my parents who are in their mid 80s, they are thrilled with it. Features they enjoy most are shopping list management and personalized music choices. Would like to see E911 calling added to Alexa capabilities, then this device would be perfect.
