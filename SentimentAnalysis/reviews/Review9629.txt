Would give it 5 stars if they can come up with a way to make the battery chargeable instead of having to have it plugged in all the time.  I bought this for my in-laws as a gift and I must say it's a pretty sweet product with a lot of usable functions.  The sound is great and the Echo does a fantastic job on picking up your voice even with the music up pretty loud.  I would probably have to help my parents set this up as they're not too tech savvy so keep that in mind if you are buying it for someone.  Overall its a great product that will get some good use.
