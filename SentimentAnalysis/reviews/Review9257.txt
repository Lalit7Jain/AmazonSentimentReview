It has a lot of very functional uses. You can add things to your shopping list and to-do list, ask it anything you would ask google (facts, weather, sports, etc), ask the time, set alarms/timers, play music and control volume. I have used all of those functions and they work well. The alarm sound is perfect. I was worried it would be a loud and jarring sound, but it wasn't.
