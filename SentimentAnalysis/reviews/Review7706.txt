We are having a great time interacting with Alexa. The music quality is great for our needs and the skills are fun as well. The best part of Alexa is knowing she will continue to grow with skills and having a smart home is now on the horizon! I highly recommend being an Amazon Prime member. She even let's me know when my packages are due to arrive.
