Still getting use to talking out loud to a machine, wife hates it. It has so many functions that you really need to search the internet to learn them and do a periodic check since they add new functions on an extremely regular basis. I use it to get a weather report and news report while making coffee. I also am now using it as a cooking timer when I have more then one item that needs timed. I am a novice user, I recommend you do a bit of research prior to ordering to see the thousands of things you can do with it and see if it will work for you. I give it 4 stores since it started playing hardcore RAP music while my mother was visiting scaring the daylights out of her and my wife since it was so late and neither one had used the "ALEXA" keyword to when I checked the recording on the Alexa APP to see what hard started the music. This furthermore made my wife hate it. It is fun to listen to the older commands on the APP when you are not home. I had quite a laugh listening to my wife ask Alexa how much she cost trying to learn more about it and give me grief is my guess. Alexa at least didn't tell on me!
