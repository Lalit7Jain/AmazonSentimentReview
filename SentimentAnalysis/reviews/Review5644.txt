We've only had this for two days, but my family loves it.  "Alexa, play Tennessee Whiskey."  Boom.  "Alexa, who plays football today?".  Bam.  My 7 year old daughter keeps asking random questions like "How many stars are there?" and gets answers.  We bought the Hue lights to go with it.  Really cool and convenient to voice command the lights on/off. I recommend it!
