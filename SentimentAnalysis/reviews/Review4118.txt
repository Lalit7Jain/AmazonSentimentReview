Great Alexa interface and stand alone speaker (non hi-fi). The bummer is that it does not connect to external speakers through Bluetooth or external stereo cable. These tasks can only be done with the Dot. So get an Echo if you plan to use it as your speaker solution for Alexa since it is a much improved speaker than the Dot. If you are more serious about music then neither speaker will suffice and you will need to connect a Dot to an amplifier with stereo speakers or other speaker solution. Still only going to get steaming quality output either way.
