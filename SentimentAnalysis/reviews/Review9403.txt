We love Alexa - my three year old and I went from having dance parties listening to music on my iPhone to being able to use our "robot" to play our music for us!  I love listening to my daughter try to talk to Alexa.  I'm sure we're completely under utilizing her, as I know she has tons of functionality.  But the three year old is very protective of what we ask Alexa to do.
