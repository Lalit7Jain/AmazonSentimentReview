the Echo itself is great. Setup was a breeze. However, I recently ordered the Echo Dot and after 3 hours have given up trying to get it to work. I did briefly hear Alexa's voice on the Dot, though, and it is thin, sharp, and unpleasant compared the the original full sized Echo. The bottom line based on my experience. The Echo is great. The Echo Dot is useless. I'm returning mine.
