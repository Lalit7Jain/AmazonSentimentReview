Conversations: Alexa can only follow ONE thing at a time. Thus you ask a question. Get answer. You have a follow up question on same topic....forget it, she has forgotten what you were talking about faster than a 5 year changes their mind. Conversation is not fluid, very stunted. Constantly need to rephrase and remind her what you are talking about.
