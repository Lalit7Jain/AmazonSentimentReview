3. Third, when you tell her to play a certain type of music, she plays it for a while, but arbitrarily shuts off at some seemingly random point. For example, some nights when I go to bed, I might ask Echo to play piano sonatas. She starts playing the songs just fine. But if I wake up an hour or two later, the music is no longer playing. Echo shouldn't be the one deciding how long I get to hear music. It should play until I tell it to stop. I like having pleasant music playing softly while I sleep. I've had to go back to using my iPad for this task because Echo just won't do it.
