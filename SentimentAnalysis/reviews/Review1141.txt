I've had Amazon Alexa for 1.5 years now. I have thoroughly enjoyed this product and converted my house to a "Smart Home" based around it. I have also purchased an Echo Dot to add to my room. The device listens for most part accurately about 80% of the time, much better than attempting to speak with Siri on iPhone. What has surprised me most is the distance at which the device could hear and understand me accurately. I am however giving this product now a 1 star simply because it no longer works. I have had the device as said before for a 1.5 years and for any device to stop working after such a limited amount of time is unacceptable to me. I did speak with Amazon regarding this and their attempt at finding a solution was sending me a new power adapter, which ended up not solving my problem. I again called back to customer service who stated that the device has a warranty of only a year so they could no longer replace it but send me an echo dot instead. I do not want another Dot but my Echo back. I am very disappointed in Amazon and will now be looking into Google Home instead.
