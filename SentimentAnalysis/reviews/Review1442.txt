If I wrote this product after receiving the Echo, I would have given it 5 stars. Think about it, the Echo is not a tool; I can't see anyway that it can be miss used, or handled incorrectly which would cause deteriorating wear and tear. It is an electronic device that sits where you place it - in your home or business - and it responds when questions are asked. Why after two years, the product would cease to work? After speaking to Echo support today, I was told it would cost me $162 for a support contract, to get it fixed. Seriously, Amazon, you could do better. In the garbage it goes, and I will not be trying anything else from Amazon, ever again.
