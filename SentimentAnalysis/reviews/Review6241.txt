I can't even describe how much we love our Echo! I was hesitant to take a step to go "smart" in the house, so we started with this echo, then graduated to Nest thermostats, had to get a couple dots, and I couldn't rave enough about how convenient it is to add things to my shopping list or to do list, or listen to music while my hands are too busy to use my phone, etc.
