2. Another issue is the music. When I ask for Classical music, Alexa opens with the same exact song each time. If I hear Pachabel's Canon one more time...!! When you ask for Smooth Jazz, get ready to hear Kenny G. The music should be upgraded and songs added on a weekly basis. I am getting ready to switch back to my satellite TV music stations which switch up the music selections more frequently.
