I love that I can easily listen to my favorite radio station or playlist. I can easily ask Alexa to play my music on Spotify or my favorite artist on Pandora. And the fact that I can have her read me my Kindle books while I am cooking or cleaning makes Echo one of my favorite electronics in the house.
