Alexa is an absolute must have! My children and I are very impressed with this product. I wake up to the children asking "Alexa what is...?" Or "Alexa, how do I...?", "Alex, play a game",  "Alexa, tell me a joke", "Alexa, set an alarm",  "Alexa, play music."  This is only the tip of the iceberg of what Echo is capable of. She can read you books and when linked to other devices, she can turn on and off devices. The speaker system on this is impressive, and I absolutely recommend the Echo.
