Love my Echo. My son hooked up Bluetooth so I can play my music that's on my phone thru Echos speakers. I  asked it to play music of the 80 etc.  I set alarms, ask Echo what's on my calendar for the week. It's great to say put something on your Shopping list especially when you are cooking and can't text it in. The speakers sound great.
