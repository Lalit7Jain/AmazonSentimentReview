I love my echo in white goes with my decor. When I got it I had my son hook it up and I was amazed at the sound. It sounded better than the echo dot, way better and I also bought the rechargeable base too. I can take it anywhere in my home or outside on my front porch or patio. I just love it especially when I talk to it. I think my husband loves it cause it you can tell it what to do. Like cut on and off the lights or order something or ask it questions like the weather and time. It's just great having around the house.im even thinking of taking it with me when we go out of town on our little getaway trip. Thanks amazon you've done it again<f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+008F><U+00BF><U+2764><U+FE0F><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083>
