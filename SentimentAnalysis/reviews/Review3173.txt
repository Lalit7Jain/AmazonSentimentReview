I Absolutely love it!!! So far I have not been disappointed with Echo at all. I even bought one for my brother for his birthday and the fire stick. I don't think anyone would be disappointed with it. You can just ask and right away you have your answer or favorite music playing. You can find out road conditions, weather, weather in another state, ask and order for deal of the day,news etc. I would recommend Echo to anyone and have. Amazon is  number one in my eyes. Apple not so much all though I do like my Mac. If Amazon comes out with a computer like Mac I would buy it in a heartbeat. Heck Alexa would probably take over my keyboard and all I would have to do is sit back and tell her what to type. Hopefully Amazon will come out with something like that. It wouldn't surprise me any if they did do it. :)
