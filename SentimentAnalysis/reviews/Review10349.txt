If I wake up in the middle of the night, I can ask the Echo the time, the weather or to read for a set time such 10, 15 minutes or more until I can go back to sleep or I can even ask for a joke.  If I tell the Echo to stop reading, I can pick up my Kindle the next time I want to read and will not have lost my place in the story.  The Echo will play my music playlists or I can ask for new music by favorite singers.  I can also request almost any kind of music to suit my mood with Amazon's Music Unlimited app.  There are a large number of skills on the Amazon Alexa site which can enabled to make the Echo even more useful.
