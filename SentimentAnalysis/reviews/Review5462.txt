Love this Echo.  If for no other reason because it's so much simpler to ask Alexa to play my playlist than it is to connect my phone or tablet and find the music I want.  The sound quality is excellent.  My thought process in buying is that I wanted a bluetooth speaker and by going with the Echo I got that and the other features as a bonus.  I haven't been disappointed.  I was bitter toward Alexa for awhile.... when Amazon put it on sale for $40 of on cyber week (a few weeks after I bought it) and refused to adjust the price for previous purchases - said I could purchase at the sale price and return mine.  It's the only negative customer service experience I've had with Amazon, so I'll get over it.
