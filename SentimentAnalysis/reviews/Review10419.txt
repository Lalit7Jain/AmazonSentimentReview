Was a little skeptical buying referbished but I couldn't be happier! Alexa has become an everyday essential in the house! Our little one even used it to sing him happy birthday for a quick pick me up! Lol so happy with this purchase and highly suggest to any house with a family or even just roommates. She's the life of the party!
