Biggest piece of junk ever. Quits working at random. i have opened several tickets with Amazon and they do nothing. They have me unplug the item and plug it back in. How useful is that. The refuse to replace it. What terrible service. Be very cautious when purchasing this item. Be prepared to write it off if it quits working
