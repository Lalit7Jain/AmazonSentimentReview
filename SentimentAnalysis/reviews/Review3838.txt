When I ask Alexa to order items that I've ordered many times before on amazon.com, AND I specifically use the exact product title, it cannot find it or suggests random alternatives. I've even tried speaking and over articulating my words to help it out. No dice. A disappointment. I must resort to opening my laptop or using my phone to place new orders.
