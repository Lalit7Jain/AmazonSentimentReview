I am a volunteer for disaster services and like to listen to my local Police, Fire, and EMS scanner when I'm on duty. Alexa says "Not available at this time" when I ask her to play any scanner station via Tunein. I can Bluetooth from my phone, but doing that disrupts the wireless router signal throughout my home. Maddening.
