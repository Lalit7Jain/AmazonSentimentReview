It hardly ever understands questions and you can forget about asking it a semi complex questions, half the time i get frustrated and just look them up on my phone. Its basically a glorified alarm clock. Would not buy again would not recommend. The way you talk to it is not natural, i dont want to say play "on spotify" after every song request. they need to add the ability to set new default sources for some things like music and weather.
