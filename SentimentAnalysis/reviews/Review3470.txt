I signed up for Amazon Music Unlimited for access to a larger library of classical music.  But, even when an album is listed as available for play on the Echo under the Unlimited plan, Alexa has -- more often than not -- been unable to recognize the titles. Moreover, there is currently no way to create a playlist on the app or website for these supposedly streamable albums with a simplified name that Alexa might recognize (which is what I do with the classical music in the My Library).  At the end of the day, even though there are, for example, a number of editions of Mozart's Die Entführung aus dem Serail listed as available for streaming on Echo under that Amazon Music Unlimited plan, the only response I received from Alexa so far is "I cant' find...." over and over.  To be fair, Alexa has no problem with requests like "play songs by Pink," or "play solo classical piano music."  But, I've had virtually no success with getting it to play specific classical titles  I'm canceling Music Unlimited and keeping my fingers crossed that they will improve the search capability in the app at some point so that streaming classical music with longer, complex titles is possible .
