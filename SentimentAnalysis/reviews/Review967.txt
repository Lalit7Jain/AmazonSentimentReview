It works fairly well, but has some drawbacks. I've had the Echo for more than 2 months, and it's still learning to recognize quite a few words. It's a little frustrating to have repeat a word multiple times. I think it does pretty well as a speaker for music, and plays nicely with Spotify. Also, it's an easy way to set a timer, or set up an appointment for your calendar. I like using it to keep track of things I need to pick up at the grocery store. Very handy.
