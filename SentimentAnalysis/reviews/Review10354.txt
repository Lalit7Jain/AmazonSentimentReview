My daughter loves her echo. She's constantly playing music, setting alarms, etc.  when it's playing music it is hard to "wake"  Alexa so I often find her yelling over her music to "get her attention" Good purchase, but wish we had gotten the dot bc of the better value and ability to connect headphones or a speaker.
