If technology isn't your thing you will need help getting music and other thing set up. I watched utube video's for some and call a friend for the rest. You can NOT use this without a smartphone or tablet and Wi-Fi. My brother gave me his old smart phone or this would be useless to me. With that said what I have used so far is amazing.
