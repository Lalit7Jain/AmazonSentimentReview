I had actually bought Google Play first but returned it because I couldn't use it as a blue tooth speaker to play music from my phone. I feel like I'm still learning to use its features. Google was really good at answering all questions. Echo doesn't have all of the answers. I use it mainly for music, my morning commute times, and weather updates. My kids love it even though Alexa doesn't always understand them. I like the mute feature. I do believe I will learn to get better use of it once I take the time to learn more about it.
