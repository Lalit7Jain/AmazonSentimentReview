This is one of my favorite things of 2016.  It's amazing. It understands every member of my family, manages our shopping lists, orders new stuff from Amazon, reads the news, plays music, orders pizza... seriously?  It's amazing.  Once you get used to interacting with Echo, you'll want to put Hue or Wemo lights in all of your sockets so you never have to flip a switch again.  I can control my lighting, music, news... everything with my voice thanks to Alexa.  She's literally the first person I talk to every morning, and the last person I talk to every night.
