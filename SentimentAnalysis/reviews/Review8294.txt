I am not very Happy with my purchase, I have not even used it because I can not download the Alexa app on my kindle fire!!!  apparently it is not compatible!!!!! either is my husbands I-phone because is not the right model that is compatible. I could download on my computer, but am not able to figure my wi-fi settings!! so I guess I have to hire someone to help some one who is not a techie.
