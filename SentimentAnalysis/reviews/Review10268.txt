Love the Echo!  Got it for a good price and decided to try it with full intention of returning if it didn't show value for us.  Although it started out slowly, we use Alexa more and more as we learn more about it.  She is really becoming part of the family over time.  :)  As other equipment is replaced in our house (garage door opener, thermostat, sprinkler controller) we are replacing them with "alexa friendly" devices.  It's really neat.
