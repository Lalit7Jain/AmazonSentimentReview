I do not understand all the excitement about this product !!  The feature can be helpful if connected to an internet screen, but as an audio only device I never have found it helpful.  I would say 70% of what I ask for, she can't answer.  I find Siri can answer my questions more readily and my iphone is always with me, and I don't have to go to a specific room to ask my question.  My first choice - Cortana on my Microsoft Surface Pro 4.  She always has a solution and a choice of links for your answer.  Music??  Playlists on your phone and a portable Bluetooth speaker and you'll hear what you want, where you want and not just what Alexa wants to play. Time to re-gift this one !!
