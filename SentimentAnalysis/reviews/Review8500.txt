Ok, I'm fairly t ch savvy...I mean, I don't write code, but I'm fairly good with this kind of thing.  I have to say, my Alexa must be the Grrr version (is in Invader Zim's robotic companion who was made from piece parts).  This Alexa knows nothing other than weather and Jeapardy.  She can play some songs, but if I ask her to play, say Josh Groban's O Holy Night, she doesn't recognize it.  I ask about a park wear a college game is currently being played, she doesn't know that.  I had a magazine with Helen Mirren on the cover.  I asked Alexa about her.  She did. To understand the question.  My spouse calls it a POS. I want to keep it, but I need Alexa to step up her game.
