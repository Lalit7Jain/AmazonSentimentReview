The unit has a good speaker system as we like to use it for music/ radio and news updates, its fast , fun and full of great skills . It was a breeze to setup I was using in less than a few minutes . Only con for me is it could use more music/ radio skills ...but I think that will come soon. We still have lots of great skills to add on the Echo.
