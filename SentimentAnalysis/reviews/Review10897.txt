My biggest complaint with this is the kids yelling "Alexa" 4000 times day to get it to tell them jokes or play music, but other than that it works ok.  It doesn't always understand what is asked and even after several attempts, it just doesn't get it.  I think for stuff you ask regularly it works great.  I think it is more of a toy than something I would say is totally necessary or even super useful.  My family likes it more than I do.
