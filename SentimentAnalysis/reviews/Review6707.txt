Whether the stand-alone Echo is worth the price is a question worth asking--when one can get the Dot and a quality bluetooth speaker for less.  The sound quality on the Echo is...alright.  I'm picky, and it's well-enough for casual use.  It can play surprisingly loud without appreciable distortion--which was surprising.  The sound is clear and certainly well enough for voice; and it's well-enough for music.  We keep ours about 10 inches away from the wall for better microphone sensitivity and sound quality.  Since buying this Echo, we've bought 4 Dots...so I'm certainly a believer in the technology.  Since I'm already an audio-gear guy, it's just better sounding and more cost-effective to buy the Dots and plug them into my existing sound systems.
