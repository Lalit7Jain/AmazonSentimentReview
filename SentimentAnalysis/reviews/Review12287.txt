I've increased my rating to four stars from the previous three. The connection problems I mentioned before have never returned and performance has been consistently smooth. I still think there is a better way to call up music; it remains a struggle with even slightly complex album or band names. The sound quality is excellent. The far-field mics are pretty good, although they struggle to hear commands consistently beyond volume level five. I love having Alexa to add calendar events, grocery items, and timers. Overall, I'm very satisfied with my Echo and hope the technology continues to improve.
