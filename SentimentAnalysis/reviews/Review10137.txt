I just received my Echo today and I already am in love, 5 stars for one of the most interesting technical parts of my life. It plays your music, it can read you books. It answers any question at all you have for it. It  will update you on all your favorite sports teams. It sets alarms and timers for you. It will add things to your shopping list as you think of it. It will add things to your calendar as you think of it. It even can operate things in your home like your smart thermostat or the lights in your home. There isn't much it cannot do. She is awesome!!
