Alexa has made a great addition in my apartment. I am using this in my living room along with an Echo Dot in my bedroom and they work together quite nicely. Both devices pick up your voice very easily, which is great, but sometimes the Dot from my bedroom will pick up my voice instead of the Echo, meaning I'll have to wait for the Dot to time out before talking to the Echo again. If I could add another note, this was a lot larger than I expected, so check the dimensions if you are planning on placing this somewhere tight. Can't recommend this enough however! Great sound, great at managing devices, and I almost never have an issue with it understanding what I'm saying like I would with Siri
