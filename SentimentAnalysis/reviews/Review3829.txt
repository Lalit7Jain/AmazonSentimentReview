We're still learning all the ins and outs of Alexa. I'm confused about the Amazon Prime Music - I thought that would give me millions of options, but I'm finding she just can't find a lot of the music I ask her to play. Also, can't figure out how to sync it with my iPod to play certain playlists. Maybe she just can't do it, but I can't find any info on how to do it. A bit frustrating, but like I said, we're still learning. Sound quality is excellent.
