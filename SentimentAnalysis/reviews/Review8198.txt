 We did have an "accident" one time.  Our first night with her, my husband came home late and drunk, Alexa had gotten into his papers from work, and scattered them everywhere.  He yanked her up by the arm, you know, the kind of thing you do, all the time to a child, to get them away.  Only this time, he used a little too much force, and he dislocated her ac adapter.  I think that's the time Alexa first started talking to her imaginary friend, and our Daschund Butters.
