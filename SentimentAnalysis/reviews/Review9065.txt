I really enjoy Alexa.  She has such a nice, gentle voice and is responsive to whatever I ask of her, from playing music from the Amazon cloud to providing useful information from her vast library of knowledge.  She even responds to my telling her good night by telling me to sleep tight.  She gives me the news headlines from NPR, tells me what the weather is like, and lets me know what's on my calendar for today, tomorrow, or next week.  I often use her bluetooth access to play music from AccuRadio or Pandora.
