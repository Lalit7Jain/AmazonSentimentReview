Very cool and works great almost out of the box with little setup. Use is limited unless you already have smart home with a bridge or controller. The device does not automatically find and connect very many wifi devices. Compatibility is no where near broad enough to justify the cost. Sounds quality is good... But certainly not worth the expense over the dot.
