This is a disaster of a product, and the fact that Amazon would not give a full refund simply adds insult to injury. After hours of trying the "recommended" solutions and hours more on hold or online, I have learned that one should not buy electronic devices directly from Amazon: it is much better to buy from a local retailer who will stand by their product and give a full refund when the product fails.
