My husband and I love this device! We have hooked it up to Nest and table lamps with smart plugs. We use it for just about everything and find it most useful in our kitchen/dining room area. We know have a remote so we are not always shouting at Alexa. She does have problems every now and again, but nothing major. You have to be confident and precise in your requests; she will misunderstand you if your mumble or take too long to get out the request.
