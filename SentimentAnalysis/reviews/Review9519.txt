The speaker is good. I really enjoy asking for music and getting it as soon as I ask. It's added a lot to the Christmas feel of my house. I WOULD love the Echo if Alexa could answer more of my questions. It's really limited. Like REALLY LIMITED. Wanna know what Die Hard is rated? Alexa doesn't know. Google on my phone tells me immediately. What movies are playing at my local theater? Alexa doesn't know. Google does... But if you ask her if she prefers cats or dogs she can let you know "she likes Toitles" (turtles with a funny accent). While cute... I'd like more answers to my questions. I'm considering giving it away as a gift and getting a Google home just for the better responses. I'm getting sick of asking her things that seem easy for her to still not be able to get it. I just go find my phone and ask Google. Upgrade this, Amazon! You can do it!
