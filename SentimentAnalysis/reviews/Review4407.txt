My ONLY complaint is that in this day and age, this should automatically be wireless!!! I find myself constantly frustrated that it's plugged in. If you unplug it, even for 10 seconds to move it, it completely turns off and has to restart. Other than that, this thing is AMAZING!!! Excellent sound, great selection with Amazon unlimited music, Alexa responds to voice 95% of the time (no one is perfect).
