Cool product. Alexa has a LONG way to go (ummm, why can't she wake me up to music instead of the most obnoxious generic alarm ever?) but if you have HUE light system, Nest, Spotify, and put it in the kitchen to use timers, it is worth having. Just don't bother asking her questions besides what time it is or a game score/S&P500 count. She uses the search engine Bing, so almost every answer is more hassle than convenience.
