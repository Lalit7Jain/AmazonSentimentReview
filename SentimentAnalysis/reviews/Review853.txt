Great tool and I hardly have  scratch the surface of what it can do.  Just being able to tell it to "play my John Mayer Radio station on Pandora" is enough for me to love it.  No buttons to push, it just works when you talk to it.  EASY!  I love asking for a "news flash" every morning while my coffee is brewing.
