Installed this last night.  So far this is an amazing product.  We have embarked on making our home "smart."  This is a great product so far - it recognizes my voice and my husbands.  I often have trouble with voice activated devices misunderstanding me, but so far Alexa seems not to have too much trouble.  We are still exploring all this device has to offer will update as we gain more experience with it.  I asked for a genre of music I haven't heard in a long time and instantly picked all my favorites for that timeframe.  We are building our first shopping list, and added our first alarm - we will see how that goes in the morning.  We will update as we learn more.
