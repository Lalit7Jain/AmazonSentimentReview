The sound quality is pretty good for a Bluetooth speaker.  Music sounds rich with sufficient bass that it does not sound tinny like other speakers.  It can play music pretty loudly, and you can adjust the volume just by asking Alexa to turn it up or down.  You can ask Alexa to play music from your collection on Amazon's music server.  You can ask Alexa to play any type of music, though, and if it is not part of your collection it will stream music from a free service much like a radio station (but with no commercials).
