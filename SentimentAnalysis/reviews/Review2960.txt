Linked my cap 1 card, and I can order directly from Alexa's versus signing into my Amazon account from my PC.  I've had it about 2 weeks... so far nothing but rave reviews.  I will say since I keep this one in the bedroom I feel I could've saved a bit with the $50 model... either way, it was well worth the expense.
