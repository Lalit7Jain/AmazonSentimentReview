I would have given this five stars if you played with Apple devices better. I wanted it to check my calendar and to listen to my iTunes music both of which is hard to do. You have to pair and use your iphone to listen to iTunes music and Alexis default calendar is Google calendar which I don't use and don't like. Once I learned how to phrase questions most of my questions were answered accurately and properly.  There is so much that she does well that I would not have a problem recommending this device and some of the problems I do have  maybe be me doing something wrong I've only had this just a little over a week
