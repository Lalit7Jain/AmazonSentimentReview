2) It cannot work "with" other DOT/Echo/etc. units to cover the whole house.  For example if you have a Dot upstairs and you set a timer on your Echo in the kitchen, the Dot upstairs will not alert you when that timer is done.  You also cannot use them to play music through the whole house.  This might be a trade off, for example you can play two different music sources at the same time, and sometimes you don't all the devices doing the same thing.  Perhaps they need a new keyword that allows all Alexa devices to operate as whole house for music, alarms, timers etc.
