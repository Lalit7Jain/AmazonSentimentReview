I have both the Echo, and her little sister, Dot. Both work exactly the same. The difference is that the Dot is way cheaper.  However, and that's a BIG  HOWEVER, the Dot has pathetic speakers. I use the Dot on my bedside nightstand, and the larger Echo in my living room. I think you can connect better speakers to the Dot, but I don't know how, yet. So, your choice is to save money (DOT), or have really fantastic speakers (ECHO).
