To be clear, the Echo is user friendly, loaded with Easter-eggs, fairly accurate, and does what it claims.  The things it's lacking on are most likely the result of poorly written apps/skills by other hardware vendors (Logitech).  It's fun to mess around with, but the novelty quickly wears off.  Also, the product is plastic, but appears fairly well made.  This technology should get better as it becomes more common and more players enter the market (Google/Microsoft), and more developers start writing for the device.
