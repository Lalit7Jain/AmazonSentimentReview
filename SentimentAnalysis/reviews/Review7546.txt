So far I like Echo and Alexa, I just wish I didn't have to pay for and buy a paperback to learn more about what I can do with my Echo. Wish there was a full manual and additional info in a complete PDF manual/book to get all the details available about the Echo and Alexa. Still learning and liking so far!
