One might notice that the Echo, Echo Dot and Tap are often paired with supplemental bluetooth speakers with 2-3 item purchase combination discounts.  This is a very misleading promotion as it leads one to believe they can be used for simultaneous streaming.  That is not the case at all.  Unfortunately, the E-Dot only has a one-way BT connection.  Either you play music from the E-Dot or the BT speaker; but, you cannot play music from both.
