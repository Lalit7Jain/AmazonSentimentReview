I am at a loss as to why Amazon would continue to allow such a horrible app like the Alexa iPhone app to continue.  While the Echo is great for telling me the time and weather.  It is always confused how to turn on and off Hue lights.  I got them all in and working one day, and the next day Alexa had forgotten how to turn the Hue lights on and off.  The Alexa app appears to have been developed by someone in 1995.
