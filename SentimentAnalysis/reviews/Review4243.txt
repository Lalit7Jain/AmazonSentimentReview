We love our Echo!  My husband is having a harder time getting "Alexa" to understand him, but I haven't had too many issues.  We received it just after Christmas, so we haven't played with it all that much.  Easy to get started, and easy to go into the app on my cellphone and on Amazon to learn new skills.  What I really, really want to know from Amazon is when they are going to come out with a car version???????
