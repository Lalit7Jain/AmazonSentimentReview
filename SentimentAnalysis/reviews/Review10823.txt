Our second Echo. This one, a refurb, to take advantage of the discount. This will be used in the workshop. Our first Echo is temperamental but for the most part it is a valued part of the household for weather updates, the news flash, and Sunday morning music. This 2nd Echo connected smoothly. Out of the carton, plugged in, opened the Alexa app on my phone, followed the steps, and we were in business. Hopefully this one won't have connection problems. If it does, they are easy enough to reconnect.
