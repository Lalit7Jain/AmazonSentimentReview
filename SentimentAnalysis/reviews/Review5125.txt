Bought this a couple days after buying the echo dot at Staples, so that should tell you how much I enjoy having the Echo around the house. This one is in my living room and it will fill the house with music or podcasts, no problem. Sound quality is great, build quality is outstanding. If you're on the fence, try out the Echo Dot first (I keep mine on the nightstand next to my bed). Amazon is really on to something with the Echo, and the integrations are wonderful. Can't wait to see what they come up with next.
