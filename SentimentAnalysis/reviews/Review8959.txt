Skills:  There are hundreds.... thousands?  Most of what I've looked at, and I haven't looked at all of them, don't appeal to me.  For instance, the Good Housekeeping skill offers steps to remove common stains.  I need this info in writing because I can't remember detailed instructions. Nonetheless, it has almost 5 stars.  I suggest looking at the skills page before purchasing so you know what to expect.
