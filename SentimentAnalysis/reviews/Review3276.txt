How did our house function before Alexa? Simple set-up, easy to get the hang of. We use her for everything! Weather, news, sports, calendars, grocery, alarms, trivia, games, MUSIC above all. Her volume 10 is LOUD and crystal clear. She has thousands of skills that can be enabled at no cost, simply by telling her to enable it. I can see searches and control alarms, timers, smart devices she's linked to and more from the Alexa app. I knew this would be a useful device, but I had no idea how useful! And with updates, she's constantly getting smarter. I love her like a pet.
