So far I love my Amazon Echo and its only been a little over 24 hours! Alexa is helpful in the kitchen to set timers, and create shopping lists, ask for news and weather updates, as well as play music to cook and eat dinner by. I purchased the philips ambient white starter kit and although it was a little bit of an issue getting them to pair, i can ask Alexa to turn on and off the lights in my living room. Eventually i'd love to upgrade all of the home lighting to be voice controlled. My younger kids love asking Alexa for a joke or a random fact. I can't wait to get to know this device more
