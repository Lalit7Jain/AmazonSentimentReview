There needs to be an urban version of Echo.  When asked - Alexa did not know information oin any contempary hip hop artists.  But she knew all about Taylor Swift.  Alexa did not know basic stats for LeBron James - the basketball super star.  But she knew about hockey players.  I was excited with the purchase at first but now feel its "just okay".  Echo's intelligence needs to be enhanced to reflect a broader population. Wait for the "intelligence" to be upgraded.  Right now - she's not soo pretty smart.  Just my two cents.
