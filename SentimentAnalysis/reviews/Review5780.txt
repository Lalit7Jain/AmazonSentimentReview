For the most part I really like my Echo.  The sound is great, when I'm bored I can ask it questions, it reads my books to me, plays my music.  But, it's a bit cumbersome in its use with certain things.  Like if I miss a couple of seconds during an audible read, let's say, I can't just tell it to go back one minutes.  I have to go back a full chapter.  Also, I'd really wanted to use it to listen to podcasts, but it's too cumbersome to bother with.  It plays the most recent episode of a podcast.  To go back you have to say previous podcast over and over again to get to the one you want and when that's over, it jumps back to the most recent episode.  With both audible books and podcasts, one can easily use the app for fine tuning, but I'd really kind of wanted to be able to just speak to it.  This is currently my favorite toy, but it's got a way to go, I think.
