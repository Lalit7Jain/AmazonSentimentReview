I purchased this for my dad thinking he would enjoy throwing out questions, quickly getting answers and just exploring what all he could use it for. He promptly set it up without a hitch upon getting it home Christmas night. The clarity of the sound when Alexa answers is amazing.  My dad asked Alexa to add milk to the grocery list and she responded that she added milk.  He was beaming from ear to ear.  On his smartphone he can access that list, which my mom found comical because, he doesn't go the store, she does and she doesn't have the smart phone.  I think they are going to enjoy exploring all they can use Alexa for.  I would highly recommend the Echo. It has a clean look, voice clarity is amazing and the versatility is endless.  I was so excited watching them interact with the Echo that I'm going to order one for myself!
