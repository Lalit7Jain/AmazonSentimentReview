Turns out the Echo is a pretty good blue tooth speaker, can play songs on demand, is handy as a timer and for measurement conversion, answers a few questions, but is otherwise pretty stupid, meaning it  just doesn't know a whole lot.  I thought I would be able to simply ask a question and I would get the answer. Mostly the answer is, I can't find the answer to that question.  We're talking pretty uncomplicated questions: i.e. What's the closest star and what is the recommended refrigerator temperature.  Back to google.  Guess I expected  too much.  I do enjoy the Eco, except when I am yelling at Alexa for repeatedly saying, Ummm, I don't know what you mean by that question.
