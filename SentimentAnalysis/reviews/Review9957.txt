Refurbished? I'd say it is brand new! Alexa is awesome for random information, quick info on movie characters or movie times, helpful for local restaurants, good for music (amazing sound quality), and much more! Just simply setting timers in the kitchen via voice is a small thing but has such a big impact. She turns on my TV and lights and everyone thinks we are 'futuristic'. She is way better than Siri. Always listening and is very quick and responsive with answers and information. If you have the money, get this product! It is fun to have around the house!
