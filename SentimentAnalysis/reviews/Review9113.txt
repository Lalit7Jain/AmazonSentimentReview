Delivered exactly as advertised.  I became aware that to control a "smart" home, like TV, PlayStation,Receivers, etc., another module was required, supplied by a preferred vendor (e.g. Logitech Harmony Hub).  WeMo Switches also required their own cumbersome setup but we're easily discovered by Echo.  I also have connected RainMachine which was flawless.  Now, not only can I control all items by my mobile device but now verbally with Echo.  One are Echo seems deficient is fuller capabilities sharing response to internet quiries.
