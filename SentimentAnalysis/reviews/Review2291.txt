I'm enjoying my Echo.  Although I haven't found any real use for it save the entertainment of being able to talk to it and play music.  The functionality is still VERY limited even with what it can do.  Be forewarned though.  This uses Bing as its back end which beyond awful.  Had I realized that before buying it I may not have purchased it.  The only thing that tipped the scales is that I'm a heavy Amazon Music user and the integration with that was key.  If they can continue to improve on features this will be a great device.  The voice recognition is pretty darn spot on.  Although I could not get it to recognize "Estranged" by "Guns and Roses".
