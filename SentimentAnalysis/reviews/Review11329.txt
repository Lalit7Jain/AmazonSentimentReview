This thing is truly amazing! I had Pre-Ordered one when they were introduced for my Mother. I had put the app on my phone when I hooked it to their WiFi. Next day at work my phone kept vibrating over and over. Well, I saw everything she asked Alexa to do. What songs she requested, shopping list etc...I know she uses it a lot! I've removed the app and now bought her another one for her bedroom to control the Samsung Lights with. Very well worth it!
