Echo is always improving.  Many times "Alexa" says "I didn't understand your request", but she's getting better.  The best use, for me, is being able to listen to an Audible book or my favorite music.  I get the weather and news headlines without having to turn on my TV and be bombarded by commercials. I'm sure I could use the Echo for more and will keep trying. Eventually I'll get the Smart Home products for lights and locks and thermostat for Alexa to control. I order things from Amazon, too, which is really convenient.  Can't wait to see more improvements, then I'll give a 5 star rating!
