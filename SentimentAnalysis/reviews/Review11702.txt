I'm giving the Echo 5 stars because of how many different things you can actually do with it. I have two Phillips Hue lights, a Nest Thermostat, two Smoke/Carbon Monoxide Detectors and a Harmony remote for my entertainment system – all work great with Echo. If you're a tech person like I am and understand how IFTTT works then you can expand the Echo to do even more! One thing I have learned is you have to say thing a specific way in order for her to search SOME things correctly on the web – for instance I was curious was 30 degrees Celsius was in Fahrenheit; which took a couple tries for he to understand what I was asking. The reason I give this 5 and not 4 stars for this is because, this is technology, and the more people who buy these, the better the tech is going to get. The great thing about things connected to the web is the ability to update themselves and be better. So if you're thinking about getting one of these, DO IT! I bought mine through Amazon's payment program which allows me to pay $50/mo with absolutely NO interest. Can't beat that!
