We missed the refurb offer at 119 bucks, but managed to snag one on the black Friday sale.  See my little review on the Echo Dot about use in Canada...same things apply.  This version, with the bigger speakers, is getting a real workout playing radio stations and music, in addition to home automation.  The sound is very nice, much better than expected.  We may bump this and the Dot up to 5-stars if they continue to delight us.
