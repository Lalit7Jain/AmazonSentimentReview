Fun fun fun. Its no joke that this thing learns how you speak.. our 4yr old couldnt get Alexa to obey commands at first.. but now after a few days, Alexa listens to her and knows what she is asking for (mostly Katy Perry songs). We have added a bunch of skills and cant wait to see what else she can do.
