So, there are some downsides but, overall, I am very happy with my Echo/Alexa. I like it so much that I bought a six-pack of Second-Generation Dot/Alexas for other rooms in my home. I thought it would be nice to have one in our upstairs bedroom, my office upstairs, and my garage/shop and use the remaining Dots as Christmas gifts. I thought I might eventually set up the Echo and Dots to control my home lighting and entertainment system.
