Never been a fan of Siri nor OK Google but I have to tell you, Amazon knocked it out of the part with Alexa Echo.  Best feature is the integration with my Wink hub.  Turning lights and other devices on and off with a simple command makes my life so much easier.  The accuracy of recognition is the best I have ever seen in voice controlled devices.
