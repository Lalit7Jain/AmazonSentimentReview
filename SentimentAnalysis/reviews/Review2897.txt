I like the convience of the echo. I can get weather and  traffic conditions in the morning while going about other tasks. I also use it to control lights throughout my house. All this could be done with my iPhone granted, but then I have to stop what I'm doing to get the info. It makes life easier for me. I have the dot also and with a Bluetooth speaker can take music or news with me on the patio or in the shower. I'm very satisfied. I do hope we will be able to text and make calls soon.
