I think the Echo is a great idea which will revolutionize the way we do things. However, at this time, the product needs time to grow and expand it's capabilities. For example... When I ask Alexa for the weather I get the complete forecast which is good. That said, Alexa does not know how to respond to, "What is the wind speed?" Important for me as I fly drones. Asking her for the temperature or rain ( I forget which) the answer was the complete forecast all over again. Sorry, If I want to hear the complete forecast I'll ask for it. If I want only one specific weather item and ask for that item I don't need to hear the complete forecast. Besides which she never gave me the wind speed either generally or specifically. Another example was when I gave a song a "thumbs up" Alexa replied "You can only give a thumbs up to a custom radio station". When I asked Alexa "What is a customized radio station", she could not answer. Also, she could not play any music off my desktop, except after I uploaded to the cloud. Which meant music on my desktop inches away from me had to be streamed in from who knows where.  My Echo experience was interesting, but, at this time, the Echo seems like a toy to me... but give it time...  For now I have returned the Echo and Dot.
