Still trying to figure out exactly what to do with it, but it is entertaining.  One thing I have noticed is that unless you are asking for songs, the device does not seem to be able to answer too many questions.  For example, I asked how many feet are in a mile and it could not answer the question.  Apparently there is a way for it to ask Bing to search the internet, but I havent been able to figure out how to get that part working yet.
