Purchased for 139 on a multi payment plan because I wasn't sure if I'd continue it after the novelty wore off. Even if I only use it to play Prime music, it is worth it. Was using a Soundlink with Pandora on my iPhone. Drawbacks to that comination was two devices to charge, separate subscription, and having to scroll through music choices ot build playlists. I have never been the type to collect CDs, download music or create my own playlists. With Alexa it is sooooo easy & only one Prime membership for movies and music. After doing voice training Alexa understands me well and can understand requests from across the room. The games sre fun. Just when it sound like she has gone off track during twenty questions, she gets it. We're talking 'is it made of metal?' to the correct 'is it a spider monkey?'. My Soundlink stopped working & Echo gave me tons more at a liwer price and equal audio quality.
