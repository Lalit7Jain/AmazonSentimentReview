The Echo does quite a bit like telling jokes when I need a laugh, converting units of measure or currency, controlling my lights, or playing music.  Skills allow Alexa to integrate with more things or add more features like ordering a pizza with just my voice.  While it would be nice if the sound was adjustable, it is acceptable.  Bass extension is lacking in comparison to Sonos, and treble clarity could be better as well.
