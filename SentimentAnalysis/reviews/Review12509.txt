I like the Nest integration, I have two Nest thermostats that work well and I created a group for both so I can change both at once (I wish it could be used to override away mode).  The Harmony integration through IFTTT is nice, although it is limited to starting activities or turning off all devices (I wish it could be used to trigger individual device buttons since I have one IR light and fan switch that I'd like to be able to do more than just turn either on).  The home automation integration is great if you have a compatible hub!
