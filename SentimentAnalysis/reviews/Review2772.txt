The other problem I have is the false advertising.  On the commercial, they show a father reading to a little girl, and they ask Alexis what whales sound like.  I tried asking that question, and the unit said that whales sing beautiful songs.  True, but not the answer I was looking for.  In fact, many of the fact-type questions I have asked have not been answered either correctly or at all.  That's fine, except they advertise that it will answer those sorts of questions.
