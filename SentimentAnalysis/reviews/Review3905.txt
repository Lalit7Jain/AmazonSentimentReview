I love the echo, it's a great product that is useful, productive, entertaining, and fun. For the price I was hoping for a little better quality sound at higher levels, but overall it's fairly good. It's somewhat of a work in progress as far as Alexa goes, can be glitchy and frustrating but it's improved in the few months I've owned it. I would love to see improvements in software especially having installed programs "at the ready" instaed of the extra step of "Alexa , open "program" and then "Alexa, "program request" . Overall a great addition to your home and life.
