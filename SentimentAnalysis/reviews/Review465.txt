Love the portability and vast music selection. We have a beach house and bring it out on the deck whenever we want to listen to music.  Name an artist and Alexa takes it from there. I'm not much of a techie but setting it up was easy. Just followed her instructions.  All you need is wifi and Amazon prime. So good we got a second one for our main house.  Always know time, weather and where to eat!!
