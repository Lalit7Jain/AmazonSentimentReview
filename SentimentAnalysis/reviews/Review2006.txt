This was the coolest thing ever for about 2 month. Like most advice pieces Alexa needs to learn your voice, and phrasing needs to be adjusted and practiced. I really enjoyed the heck out of it...then I started to get fancy. Added my Pandora stations and when I try to get particular stations to play it constantly keeps referring to the Amazon channels instead. No problem, just use the app. Then I added wifi plugs TP Link. Awesome for about 5 days then it stops responding at all. No more turning on things by voice. All over internet reviewing tips...unload app...download app...blah blah blah. Today it does nothing without me manually making it so. Defeats the purpose of this thing. I should have got a soundbar if I was going to eventually have to keep rebooting and manually using. I feel like a complete idiot some days yelling Alexa 10 times over to tell me the weather. Completely frustrating when it doesn't work. Awesome when it does. Unfortunately most of the time it doesn't and I am completely frustrated and biased against this now. Will not recommend to anyone that is not tech savvy so they can fix it every single time it won't work.
