The Echo is a wonderful product when it works and is a terrible product when it doesn't work. I Purchased one and it wouldn't connect to the Cloud I spent about 3 hours on it and kept getting error codes which had no link to anything to explain them. I worked with two Amazon help people, I wish they sourced their help people in the country where the product is being used and not overseas.  The second hep person said they would send another one and it was then back ordered two weeks lated I received the second one still had trouble connecting it but did it by myself > loved the product for a few days then had to unplug it to move it once again trouble getting it wirelessly connected to the WYFI and cloud. The product is a fun toy and I recommend it but Amazon needs to provide better connection information. For one thing they need to emphasize it can't reconnected with our having a device with a wireless link to the family router an ethernet connected computer won't work and may screw up the device, still not shue. Also The Amazon Alexa web link for set up was frequently off line meaning they had more traffic than they could support for the number of units that were being set up. Also by using the reset button on the bottom of the unit deregistered the unit which isn't obvious from the brief set up instructions and should be clarified.
