The unit arrived nicely boxed. It was in like new condition. This is one of the most fun gadgets you can buy. It is a ton of fun talking with Alexa. It took only a few minutes to set up with my Fire tablet and the Alexa app. It just doesn't get any easier to use with voice commands. Super easy to set timers and alarms. In combination with my fire tablet it helps keep me on schedule. Feeling down, ask Alexa to tell you a joke. You can ask Alexa for all sorts of information, weather, news, time, temperature, size of the Earth. Alexa easily converts units of measure. Want to hear some music just ask Alexa to play some 80s rock music. Alexa's vocabulary and skills are growing daily. Definitely a lot of fun. With additional accessories, Alexa can turn lights on and off as well as set the temperature of your home. This device has a great deal of potential.
