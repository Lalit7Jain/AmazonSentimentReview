...until app continually keep asking me to setup Echo; However, when Alexia chooses to hear me, I asked, "Alexia are you connected to the Internet?" She replies, Yes..... but, app loops for another setup. Now this contraption doesn't hear me-will not respond to voice commands. After researching and discovering a lot of other people also having this same problem it's just not me. $179.00 is a lot of money and I cannot afford to waste it. I was so hoping this device would work.
