I should have read the reviews before buying.  I bought the Amazon Echo and couldn't get it to answer any questions except the ones suggested by Amazon.  It hasn't answered more than a couple of questions I've asked it.  After this failure, I bought a Google Home (the big competitor to Echo) and it is infinitely better.  You can ask Google Home random questions using your natural voice and syntax and get an answer about half the time.  For example, Echo can't tell you who the members of a band or the cast of move/TV show are, but Google Home can.  Unless you subscribe to a service like Amazon Music, Echo can only play a shuffle of fifteen second clips of Beatles music, but Google Home goes to Pandora (no extra subscription required) and plays their full length songs.  You will enjoy the Google Home much more than the Echo.
