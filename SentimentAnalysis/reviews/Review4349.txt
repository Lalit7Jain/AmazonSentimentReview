I pre-ordered mine when they were $99 and never looked back.  Technology fascinates me to no end and yes I'm "that guy" that has to have the latest and greatest.  Neither bragging nor complaining but that's just the way it is.  My #1 priority with electronics is that they be "plug-n-play" and Echo certainly meets that priority easily.  Out of the box, plug it in, and start asking questions.  No joke it is that simple.  Everybody loves to ask questions and it really surprises me that a lot of people are not even aware this is available. Really not much I can add that is not repetitious other than it has been all I dreamt it would be and so much more.  I also purchased the Dot for my bedroom and other than speaker size there is really no difference. One more observation is that I am amazed at how many people are freaked out that "it is always listening."
