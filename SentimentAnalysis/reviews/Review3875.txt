We love our Echo.  She has become the primary entertainment hub in the house.  Not only is Alexa awesome to have as an audio controller, we also have all the lights in the house controlled by her.  Perhaps the best part of Alexa and the Echo is that new 'Skills' come out daily, so it is continually growing and changing.  We have four Echo-devices in the house.  One Echo, two Dots, and a Tap.  We also have a remote to this Echo. We can reach Alexa pretty much anywhere we want!
