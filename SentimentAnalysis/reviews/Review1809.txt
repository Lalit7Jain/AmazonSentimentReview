Fun device. Love playing music through it, granted to make the most of it we had to buy the Amazon music unlimited. Also having only one person's Amazon account to control all the skills is a bit frustrating. And god forbid you have an accent (husband is Australian), it gets either hilarious or frustrating at times. But I can never go back for the pure fact alone that she can turn my bedroom lights off without me getting out of bed on a cold winters night.
