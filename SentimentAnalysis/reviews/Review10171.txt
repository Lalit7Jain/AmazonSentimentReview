Overall we found this not very useful and the fun things were more than offset by the frustrating things. I'm thinking of getting a DOT as it is most of the functionality for a fraction of the cost, so maybe it could be worth it (just to turn on the lights, say, and to have some access to the Echo deals) but we are returning our Echo
