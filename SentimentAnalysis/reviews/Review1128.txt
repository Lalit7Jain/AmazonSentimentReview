I miss my Echo when I'm not at home, and I seriously don't understand why everyone doesn't have one in their home!! I wish it would have either a way to directly plug in a iPod or bluetooth music from a device that isn't via Amazon. Also, would love for it to pair with other speakers in the house. It is worth the money just for the ability to call out commands for shopping lists, mathematical questions, trivia, etc, but is mostly used for streaming music. In my home, I want to hear the music in more rooms.
