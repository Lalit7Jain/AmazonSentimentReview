So mad. I've tried repeatedly to get Alexa to connect to our home wifi. She will connect at other locations. Amazon support is no help. Our Internet provideo has been out 3 times. Error 7:3:0:0:1. We have changed the wifi frequency, channel, passwords, interference. Everything.  Our other devices will connect. It is rediculous Amazon does not have a better answer.  Rip off.
