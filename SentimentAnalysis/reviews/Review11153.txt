Best Amazon Purchase I've ever made! It's a fixture in my home. My boyfriend also purchased a Dot for the kitchen and set up Wink to make our home more automated. This product has become like my iPhone...it's hard to picture my life without it and I wonder how I've survived this long with out one!! Alexa is super helpful. Some examples....  Every night before bed, I have her set my wake up alarm, I ask her to cut off my bedroom light and make sure the doors are locked (her and Wink communicate), I also ask her for the news and weather while I get ready in the mornings, She also plays just about any song that I ask her to!! She is amazing!!
