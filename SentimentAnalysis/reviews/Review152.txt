I never read any instructions on Alexa, but she hasn't given me any issue with basic commands I'd expect her to handle. I'm sure she can do more that I haven't discovered yet, but she does more than enough already. I tested out some random commands and she was happy to oblige. I was pretty surprised when I asked her to play Beyoncé and she replied "shuffling songs by Beyoncé." I wasn't Bluetooth'd so I assume that amazon music is a prime member perk. But if I ask her to play a specific song, she directs me to visit the music app where I guess I have to purchase those songs to get that command going, but it would be nice if she accessed my iTunes library instead of trying to make me buy the songs again.
