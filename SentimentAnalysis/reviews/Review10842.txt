We love our Alexa! :) I use her a lot for playing music through my Amazon Prime account while I clean the house. The speakers are nice and can be very loud if you want them to be. I like that you can add items to your shopping list so that you don't forget to pick it up at the store. My kids like to ask her questions. They ask her anything from what the weather is going to be for the day to the definition of words etc. My daughter especially likes to play spelling bee and bingo with her. She is like another member of the family! Its a great purchase!!!
