I really love my Echo although I almost sent it back because it left me 'hanging' for specific music I wanted to hear while using free iHeart radio.  I decided to try the Amazon Music 30 day free trial and I LOVE it!!  I've decided to keep my Echo and buy the Amazon Music for Echo for $3.99 per month. It's wonderful to just randomly blurt out music I want to hear,and there it is.  I was also expecting it to verbally remind me to do things at a certain time of day, which it does not do. One more thing, I would like to give it a name that I like, instead of Alexa, but it only gives 3 choices of names we can use. Other than those things, I really like it alot and am having fun with it.
