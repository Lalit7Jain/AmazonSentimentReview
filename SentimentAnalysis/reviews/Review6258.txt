This thing is amazing.  So much fun.  It is used by everyone in my family.  Ranging from 8 years old to 77 years old!  She plays music, tells us the weather and even helps my daughter with her homework!  We are constantly finding new things to have her do.  Also works great with automated light switches that I have hooked up to a Wink hub.  LOVE IT!
