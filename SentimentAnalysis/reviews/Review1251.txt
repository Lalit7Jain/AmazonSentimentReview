Love Love Love this!  It has provided hours of fun and enjoyment in our house!  We have it play music, jokes, add things to our shopping list and answer maths and history questions galore.  The sound is pretty good and it is a fun device that even the most techo illiterate person can use without any problems.  It was also easy to set up and ready to go in a minute.
