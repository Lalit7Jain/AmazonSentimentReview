I don't even know how to describe my new best friend.  Alexa is just that.  When I say its like having a new family member I'm serious.  I ask her questions daily use her to place orders, music, etc...  She's very smart and on point when you request her. I even had an encounter that kinda scared me. LOL  I was watching a  movie while cleaning the house and Alexa suddenly told me that she couldn't understand my question.  I immediately muted the TV & looked around like WHAT???  It wasn't until I hit play back on the movie that I realized one of the characters in the movie was named a similar name.  LMBO...  So shes on point when she hears her name called.  It a fun gadget and has lots of uses. I also control my lights and thermostat with her. All she needs to learn how to do next is cook for me............. LOL
