We've been using this for well over a year now, and found that it's incorporated itself into our daily life.  From weather to "flash briefings" of news, the Echo is visually appealing, and is constantly updated with new skills and abilities through amazon.  Alexa's voice is pleasant and does not sound strictly computer generated, which makes her easier to listen to as well.
