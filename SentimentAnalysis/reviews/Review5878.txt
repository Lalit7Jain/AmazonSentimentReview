Worked well for a year, now malfunctioning. Below average tech support for out of warranty units. I was asked to order  a new power adapter when my Echo stopped responding to "Alexa."  I said I had tried it with a working power adapter and there was no difference,  but I was still asked to wait for a week for the replacement, which of course did not work. After seven calls for assistance, I have given up. Now it is a $200 paper weight
