Not easy to use! Limited as what you can do with it has very specific things it will do and compatible only with certain technology. As far as asking it questions which is what I thought would be fun well forget about it. I would say 90% of the questions I ask I'm told it doesn't understand but when I speak it into google on my android phone and get a spoken response almost everytime. Spent your money on something else like google home.
