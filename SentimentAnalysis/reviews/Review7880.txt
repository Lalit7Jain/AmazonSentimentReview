Very impressive! I was concerned that there would be a delay between saying "alexa" and then the command, but it's almost nonexistent... Almost like talking to a person. I was also curious about background noise. In a house with 4 kids on Christmas day, calling out Alexa to turn on Christmas music, or to ask how many tablespoons were in 1/4 cup worked seamlessly! I cant wait to explore the other features!
