Definitely love alexa.  Only gave 4 stars because it can sure use some improvements.  Such as more commands without enabling 3rd party skills.  Don't get me wrong some of the 3rd party skills are crazy good but some can be stock with the echo. I do love how you can order pizza or a Uber.  And also how you can add things to a shopping list and control music with your voice.
