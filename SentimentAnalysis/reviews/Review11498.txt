I put a Dot in the kitchen for running cooking timers and controlling lights as the Echo in my room wasn't always picking up my voice well due to distance.  Not to say these things don't have great range.  But they do have limits.  One huge gotcha for me is that the alarms and timers aren't sync'd across the Echo and Dot.  If I set an alarm in the kitchen and it goes off while I'm in my room my Echo doesn't make a peep.  And I cannot stop the alarm from the Echo in my room.  I have to go walk over to the other device to silence the alert.  Likewise if my alarm clock goes off while I'm in the kitchen the Dot will intercept my command to silence the alarm but doesn't know anything about the alarm so I get an error.  Hope they fix this gap in future updates.  AND PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THINGS NERDY LET ME CHANGE THE WAKE COMMAND TO "COMPUTER!"  I would love this device 100x more if I could say "Computer, lights" and have it turn on the lights.  Would be awesome if I could set localized light groups relative to the Alexa device I'm in range of to only affect the lights in that area.  For example if I'm in the kitchen and just ask to turn the lights on but don't specify kitchen, it should be configurable to default to turning on the kitchen lights.  I should only need to specify a light group if I'm trying to control a light group not near the device.
