Great concept and a good start to voice interface. However, one HUGE issue - the need name an app for most actions. Alexa's basic skills are great, the ability to simply ask a question and get a response is the way it should be. But needing to remember the name of all the "skills" (these are just apps) is a nightmare. Am I supposed to keep a list of the skills in my pocket and look the right one up each time I want to use it? This is a deal breaker. Unless this is fixed this will never be a very useful product.Too bad.
