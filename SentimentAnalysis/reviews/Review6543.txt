I love when I walk into the house with an armload of groceries and without breaking stride say "Alexa, play 'get stuff done' playlist from Spotify." and music starts as I walk back to the car for another load. Music not loud enough? "Alexa, Volume 6" resume with the groceries. In the morning the flash briefing function is great. The sound quality is excellent as well.
