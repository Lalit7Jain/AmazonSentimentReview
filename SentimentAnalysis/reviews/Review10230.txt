Loves the Echo. However, notices that Alexa ignores me at times. Other times she cannot hear you over the music. I would say though that I am really happy with my purchase. I purchased the $3.99 unlimited music from Amazon and she has found all my music request, even the weird ones. Speaker sound is great although I would have loved more base.
