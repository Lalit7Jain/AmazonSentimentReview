This thing is a gimmick and I don't understand why everyone is in love with it. My phone does pretty much everything this echo does except I always have my phone. Amazon wants you to buyultiple echos for your whole house. Then when you leave you go back to using the voice control on your phone anyway. For me to make this useful at home I would need at least 4 of these things. That's over 600 dollars. New light switches? That's 100 dollars per switch. New thermostat? That's 300. Door locks? 500. The list goes on and on.
