It's everything I had hoped for. Now I need to get more connectivity items to create a smarter house and then it will really work hard for me, but for now, having it play music and ask for the news or weather is awesome. I can even set an alarm to wake me up when I take a nap! Feel like I should buy the echo dot for the bedroom as my alarm clock.
