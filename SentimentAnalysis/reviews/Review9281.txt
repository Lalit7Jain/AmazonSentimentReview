I could not set it up even though I brought in my office tech support.  Spoke to Amazon tech support who said it is because my wifi connection was working through an extender and it must connect to the wifi signal coming directly from the router.  I had to return it. I gave it 2 stars because I think this should have been disclosed prominently.  A lot of people use extenders and it is a waste of their time to play around trying to set up something that cannot work.
