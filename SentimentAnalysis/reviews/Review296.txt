Great product so far. Received product and found it fairly easy to set up. Make sure first you have the Alexa app inatalled on your android or apple device . Then it is pretty straight forward . Paired my Bluetooth headphones. The 20 questions game is pretty cool . I use it to check the weather .  I like asking her to play the top 10 hits for a certain year or a certain artist . Can't wait to get some of units to turn off and on certain lights and devices .
