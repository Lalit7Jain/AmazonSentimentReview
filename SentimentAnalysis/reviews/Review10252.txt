One of the most amazing features (and yes, it is a feature) is it's VOICE. I thought Siri was a good voice until I heard Alexa. It's way more human sounding. Google Home sounds bad compared to Alexa, hands down. If Google's voice was on Par with Alexa, then I would switch to Google Home in a heartbeat...as that is a much more capable device. Alexa does some things really great, Google Home will do a lot more things great; however, saying "ok google" over and over again will annoy the hell out of me. I have no clue why Google can't figure out a simple thing: put some PERSONALITY behind your product so that people can latch onto it. Amazon has created the Alexa voice to be very human. I know the speech rendering technologies are probably very different...but as an end user, I don't care. Google Home will eventually have a great voice (as I saw in their latest show-and-tell. So, until Google Home's voice sounds like crap and you can't change the hotword "ok  google" to something, anything else! I'll stick to Alexa
