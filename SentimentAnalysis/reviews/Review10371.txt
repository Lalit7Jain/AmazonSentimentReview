I've had it for a week now. The family really enjoying the Amazon music service. All types of genres at the command of your voice. I've installed 2 Tp-link smart switches. Easy to use and integrate with Alexa. I'm able to control my outside lighting for my home. You can also set up a schedule for the lights. Also if you're away from your home you can turn on/off the lights with your smartphone. The possibilities are endless. I'm still exploring other skills. I was fortunate to get it on sale during the one year anniversary. I really recommend this product.
