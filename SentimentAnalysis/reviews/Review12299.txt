I keep learning new skills Alexa can perform and I keep getting amazed. She can give cooking recipes, recipes for cocktails. She can close the garage door. She can tell you where your next Amazon shipment is. She can purchase items from Amazon. She can even tell you a joke or sing Happy Birthday to you!
