Great conversational piece. I think my guests use the echo more than I. When a friend stayed over last month, I used the echo to play music in the evening. In much the same situation as getting an ipad, she then asked the device all kinds of silly questions, such as "Do you have a boyfriend? Do you like me? What's the meaning of life? What's your favorite color?" etc etc. It doesn't seem to be able to answer most informational questions, such as "When my niece stayed over this past weekend, I asked the echo for a weather forecast and my niece promptly wanted to know if the echo would answer her math questions, which it did. I didn't even know the device could do that. I wish there were some way of using some code word to put the device to sleep and reactivate on command.
