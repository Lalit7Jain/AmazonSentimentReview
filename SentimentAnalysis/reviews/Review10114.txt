Well.. it's alright device. I'm considering returning it and then 4 Dots I have simply because I have to return and rebuy the echo to get $40 back. I even said I'd take Amazon credit was told only $20. Once I was escalated, the manager said that by taking to him the $20 gift card offer was no longer valid and told me I was out of luck and go ahead and return.
