MY BLIND MOM ADORES HER AMAZON ECHO!  For her it is a PC that requires NO monitor, mouse or keyboard.  Now she listens to books, music, he daily news briefing, the weather report, puts shopping items on my dad's smartphone, sets alarms, gets business hours of local businesses, plays trivia games, listens to jokes, enables skills on her own and asks Alexa ALL sorts of questions!  She went to a class at Lighthouse for the Blind and was surprised they didn't even mention this device...she tells all her friends about it...and when you are blind, ANYTHING that makes you feel a little more connected to the world is like a godsend! She wishes there was a mobile one she could take with her when she goes out!
