Oh Alexa. Or Echo, or Amazon. $180 is a pretty hefty price tag when you consider all the things you can't do or flub at. Setup on this is anything but a breeze. It makes you download the Alexa app which is honestly one of the most infuriating apps you can use on an iPhone. Once you do get it set up, you would actually be amazed at it's lack of functionality. You can't buy anything on it without Prime, and the feature itself is kind of useless. I have told Alexa specific item names and sizes of products I want; rest assured by the end of our conversation I will be on my computer finding the item I want in half the time it took to ask her and none of the hassle. I use my Echo with the Phillips Hue light system. I used Siri for awhile but her witty comebacks every time I asked to turn on and off the lights got old very fast. While Echo has none of that sass, it sometimes replies, "OK" but then doesn't do anything at all. Echo is also very rude. Sometimes she will interrupt my conversations and say something so ridiculous I have to recite the last 4 sentences I said to see if I said something that even closely resembled "Alexa". Her rudeness extends beyond that, as I sometimes have to yell her name to get her attention. The news feature is limited only to national broadcasts and many will report the same thing. Now about all she's good for is timers..as long as you don't mind asking a few times.
