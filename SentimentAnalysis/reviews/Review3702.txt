The only thing I have found this useful for is playing music, other than that every time I ask it a question it says "Sorry I don't have the answer to that question". I returned the google version before even trying it thinking I would like Amazon's version better...regret that decision, hope it isn't too late to return this. As my husband called it, the most expensive radio ever.
