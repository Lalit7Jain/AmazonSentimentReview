I do enjoy the echo and will probably add the dots to it for both sides of the house use.  It is fun and also gives us a lot of information that would take us a lot of time to look up.  We did run into some trouble setting it up though and haven't decided if it was us or the echo that needed fixing at this time.  We are enjoying it and once again we thank you for the great products you give to us and the wonderful service you have.  Thanks  Judith Booth
