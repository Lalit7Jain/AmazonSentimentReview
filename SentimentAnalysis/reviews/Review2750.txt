The longer we have this, the more the issues become apparent. I'm very tired of having to repeat myself multiple times, before Alexa parses my speech correctly. I'm also disappointed that, when I ask to play songs by an artist, or songs in a genre, it plays me the exact same songs, in the exact same order every single time. There seems to be a vast amount of music, through Amazon Music, that Alexa has access to, but I can't get it to play, due to Alexa's voice interface being too limited to understand what I'm asking for.
