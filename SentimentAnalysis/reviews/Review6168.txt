I got Alexander for Christmas,was very excited.I am disappointed in her.She does well with music,games,weather,however when I as for information ,she tells me she can't find the answer.I did the voice training.She still does not understand me.She uses Wikipedia, not Google search engine.Alexander uses Bing search engine,again she has a hard time understanding commands.I was going to get my grandchildren one,but after my experience with Echo,they will be getting Google Home.A friend has one ,much better with commands and getting information.
