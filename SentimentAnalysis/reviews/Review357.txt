It does what ever it wants. And I think it's getting worst. I have had all my friends try to talk and if you get it on a good day it might just might work. Today I asked it to play a radio station I gave it the call letters 9 times it played 4 stations random station I picked up the remote tried it 3 more time before it worked. And this station I listen to every day on it. I have did the voice training that amazon told me to do and that was a joke. DO NOT BUY!!!  I will say great timer but little to much money  just to do that. Think might chuck this piece of cr#@ in the trash and get a google. Sorry Amazon !! If I could give it NEG stars I would !!
