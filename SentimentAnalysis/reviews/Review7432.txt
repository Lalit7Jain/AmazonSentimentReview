After the initial setup I played music from my Amazon music library and my face drooped, it sounds like music from the tin can, the Campbell soup cans that we used to make walkies-talkie when we were kids by connecting a tin wire to the center of the bottom of the cans.  For that kind of money I was expecting something to sound as least as good my Bose WiFi speaker, but this is not even close.  It's worse than a cheapo NUU Riptide WiFi speaker.  They need to work with an Audio Laboratory like Bose to improve the audio for playing music.
