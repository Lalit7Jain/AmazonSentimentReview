The echo is great for shopping and todo lists.  You  can also use it to find out the temperature or have it put on your favorite radio station etc.  Some questions my husband asked though echo was confused by and could not answer but his Siri on the iPhone did.  As I experiment with it I hope I will discover that I can do more.
