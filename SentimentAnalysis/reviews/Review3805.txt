Well, I waited a bit before I wrote a review. Had to see if this really made a difference or was just another toy. A BIG difference! I hooked up my lights just to get a better grasp of what this really means. So easy to adapt to "her." The voice interface is completely non-intrusive, and makes my requests for music, lights, news, etc and Alexa's responses seem so natural, almost as if this has always been around. Perhaps TV and movies prepared us for such an environment, but, as I said, none of this is strange but very natural.
