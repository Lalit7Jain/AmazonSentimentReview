As noted by other Echo reviewers, the bugs are apparently not yet worked out, and it seems to me that the support process has apparently been defined only for garden-variety issues. I get the feeling that this product was just released too early, and the customer service process was not coordinated with the release to deal with the inevitable problems customers would have with Echo.
