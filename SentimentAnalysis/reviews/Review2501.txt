While I love my Echo, I have had it less than two weeks.  I bought the Echo because the Tap didn't have hands-free voice activation.  Now that they have added that, I am kind of ticked off.  I spent the extra money so that I could have the voice activation, and I had to settle for not being able to take the Echo outside into the backyard on battery.  We even bought an extra Dot so that we could have the Alexa services upstairs, but now if we had waited only 2 weeks we could have had the Tap and voice activation anywhere....boooo
