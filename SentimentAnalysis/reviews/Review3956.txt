Its nice to have. Bought it for my teenage daughter....She doesn't use it much. It has its faults. It can't understand all questions. I thought it would be better for helping with my daughters homework. But it doesn't. I only had it for a month so I may need more time with it. I thought it would be more knowledgeable. But its nice to have for general questions.
