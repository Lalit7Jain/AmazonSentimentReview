I can save you alot of time!!!!! this will only operate on a 5g wifi. it would work on the 2.4, but not for very long, save yourself from misery, get a modem that you can get 5g. (call your cable company). i had a great service tech. come to my house. he was from bright house. (i had a love hate relationship with alexa, until i got 5g. (when i say 5g, i mean wifi)
