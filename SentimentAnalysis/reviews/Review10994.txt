This product does as advertised, kind of. The ad claims that she can hear you without having to shout, which is true, but not when music is playing. You can't really set a default music service, which leaves you having to mention 'Spotify' if you want to navigate through your Spotify playlist. It has a huge collection of international radio stations but won't help much with local weather or time-related reminders if you're outside the US, so don't buy this to travel with if you don't live in the states.
