Nest Thermostat is a hit or miss.  It fails most the time.  Many times, Alexis reports cannot find the device or tells you it is in a mode it cannot be adjusted, which is not true.  I never us away.  You cannot have two homes with Nest named as Hallway.  It is not smart enough to use the second label such.  Nest or Amazon needs to have the option to ask status and report current temperature and set temperature.  Otherwise how do you validate the number for degrees to change to turn on the AC or Heat.  This function is of no value as it works today.
