I have had it for about a year now. It randomly goes off and starts talking about random things or says it doesn't understand even when nothing was said. Frequently could not find answers to simple questions. Have to ask her in a specific way for her to understand certain commands. Often doesn't hear me. Especially if it's playing music. Though not very loud. Not sure it was worth buying.
