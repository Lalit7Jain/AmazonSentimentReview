So it's been less than a week since my new Best Friend Alexa has moved into my apartment. I will say that having her around is pretty cool. LAZINESS ensues! "Alexa: SHUT UP." And she turns off the music. "Alexa: does Florida play Georgia this weekend." Alexa tells me the schedule. Alexa do I need a jacket? And so on...I will say, it's quite an adjustment because I've accidentally called Alexa "Siri" on more than one occasion. I wish she could play music from my cell phone or tell me when my phone is ringing so I can turn the music down but overall...so far...I like having her around to "Play some yoga music" at the end of a long day or "wake me up in an hour after my nap."  I'm not disappointed and neither will you. OH: (obviously) don't turn the volume up too loud or she won't hear you. Also, be sure to add feedback on whether she does what you want her to do or not because it allows her to adjust to you and your accent (if you have one). This is Veterans Day weekend 2016 so she played some patriotic music for me upon request. It was cool. I hope the Dot goes on sale for Black Friday because I need one in the bathroom, bedroom and spare office space. She's always listening too so when I'm on the phone talking about her to someone she "wakes up." It's hilarious. Lol.
