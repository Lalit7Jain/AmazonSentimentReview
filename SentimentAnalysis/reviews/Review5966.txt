Streaming Spotify is super easy – even with my braces/lisp. Actually, I’m pretty amazed how even without doing much of the voice training, just how well the system understands me.  I speak softly, my voice is a little high, and new braces mean voicemail systems hang up on me and audio customer service menus don’t understand me at all - once running on any of the units, you can easily change radio station or playlist either vocally or via the Spotify app.  I’m not sure I’m ready to go Amazon Unlimited yet, I’ll have to play with it for a while.  I need to be able to create my own playlists and I love “radio” stations based off of a single track that introduce me to new artists.  I haven’t seen that available in Music Unlimited.  I am a little disappointed in the speaker quality of the Dot, it seems a bit tinny.  But, I connected to a better existing Bluetooth speaker in the bedroom and it’s fine.
