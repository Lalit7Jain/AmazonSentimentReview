Five Stars with a caveat, this will not be a true GREAT device until you don't have to mention the app you want to use.  I want every response to be seamless. "Alexa what sound does a blue jay make?"  Not "Alexa open (add app name) what sound does a blue jay make. Because I can't remember the blasted app name. With a screen you can see the app, and use it. With Alexa I have to remember that app name.  I want everything to work as well as the grocery list, generic and easy.  Yes I am picky and want Alexa to be like Rosie from the Jetsons.  I want total integration of what I need without saying the app. Alexa should know what apps I have installed and use them, WITHOUT prompting.  Come on Amazon you never heard Cpt. Kirk saying 'Computer Open comm unit and contact Scotty.'  Kirk had no stinking apps before his commands and I don't want any either. So Amazon Alexa team of brainiacs please get fixing this issue ASAP, I am 52 and need this before I get much older. Plus I really need my flying car that I was promised at five via the Jetson infomercial.
