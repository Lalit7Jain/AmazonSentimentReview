Love my Echo.  The speaker is fantastic.  I've played music on it outside at parties and many people have commented that they thought I had surround sound speakers.  I play Jeopardy on her every day.  I also love that I can tell the Echo to put things on my shopping list or my to do list.  I bought everyone in my family one for Christmas.
