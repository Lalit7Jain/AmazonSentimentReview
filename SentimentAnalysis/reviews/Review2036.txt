Plus, in a home where my husband's music varies quite a bit from my own, it wasn't straight forward how we could, as unique users, each have our own "experience" with the Echo. For example, if my husband spoke to Alexa saying, "Alexa, play music from my playlists," you'd think Alexa would play from *his* playlist. But, that didn't seem to be the case with us. Frankly, she never was able to play any music at all from his library or mine, so I don't really know what the customer experience was intended to be.
