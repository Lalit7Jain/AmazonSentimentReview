I really thought I was taking a chance with the Echo. My expectations were middle of the road but I will say without question I love it. This is the one gadget I use every single day. The voice recognition is flawless. It has integrated with every peripheral I have added seamlessly. The amount of times I use it just as a timer when I am cooking is perfect. If I had one complaint it is pretty useless to look up anything for information purposes. It is definitely not Google. The one thing I find surprising is the way it seems to add more and more "skills" each day.
