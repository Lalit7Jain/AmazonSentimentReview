There are many devices that can be connected to the Echo and more are being added all the time. Currently I only have one connected device, A nest thermostat. It does function well and I can turn on and off the hvac and change the target temperature by asking Alexa to do so. However I do have it placed in the kitchen about 8 feet away from the thermostat so I really dont use it. I could see purchasing the "dot" a smaller cheaper version of the Echo for the bedroom to be able to control it without going downstairs.
