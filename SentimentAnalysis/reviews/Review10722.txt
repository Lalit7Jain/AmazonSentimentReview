This thing is awesome. Wanted a speaker that wasn't halfway across the house to listen to while I cook. All the smart features are a bonus because I'm a Prime member and therefore have access to tons of music but also have the Hue. The sound quality is great. Using it for items you order all the time is so easy and you don't have to worry about the price. I've double checked several times.  Finding or making playlists on Prime and then asking Echo to play it still delights me after having it for months. Hue is pretty easily controlled through it, tho I wish you could request scenes. I ask it about the weather, news, sports, trivia, you name it! The name "Alexa" wasn't cutting it for me, so I started calling it "echo". Wish you could do custom names with a learning mode or something but that's another great thing about the Echo, it's always getting better! Haven't tried much else currently but REALLY, REALLY hope Amazon (PLEASE) adds control for the Fire TV. I fantasize about it all the time. MAKE IT REALITY PLEASE!
