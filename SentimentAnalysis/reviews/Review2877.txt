Alexa...make love to me.  "Sorry...I could not understand that command," she replies, but that is a small price to pay for all that she can do so well.  She plays music to cook to; sets my timers; wakes me; turns lights off; controls my thermostat (with occasional hiccups); tells me lame jokes that I love, and her skill set continues to grow.  Now if I could only get her to turn the mother-in-law off...but alas, Alexa wisely replies once again..."sorry...I could not understand that command."  May be some day...but till then I am loving her in spite of or perhaps because of her many idiosyncrasies.
