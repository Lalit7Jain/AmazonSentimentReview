I can't help but think that a collaboration  between Google and Amazon in developing Alexa would have been brilliant. Yes, I know that Amazon wants to keep its customers snugly enfolded in Amazon World, which no doubt is considered a wise business strategy, and is reminiscent of Apple's closed ecosphere. But just imagine what Alexa could do if Google provided the brains behind it. Given Alexa's limitation, we may well switch to Google Home, but for now, Alexa and her two "sister" Dots are providing good music and can answer many questions indeed. We have no need of smart home functions--I can certainly change the thermostat myself, and turn lights on and off. Who really needs that? Some of us recall when we had to get up and change the CHANNEL on the TV. Manually!
