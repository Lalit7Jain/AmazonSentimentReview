Edit:  Now Echo refuses to sync with what my phone is playing.  I tell it to play what my phone is playing and it either does a useless Bing search (yes it uses that crapshow of a search engine) or it starts randomly playing songs from my memory card.  Echo now can't do what a 20 dollar bluetooth speaker does.  Using Echo and the stupid Alexa app is just getting more and more frustrating by the second.  Why can't it play what I tell it to play, I want to play my playlist over the damn speaker and it just refuses to do so even though it did it not 8 hours ago when I was first fiddling with it.
