Echo had some cool features, but would have been great if it was rechargeable and could be used on outings like camping or going to the lake. Instead I got a Bluetooth JBL speaker that was rechargeable and can take it wherever I go. My JBL has become permanent fixture on gatherings, outings etc. Echo is great if your looking for a stationary device for home, but is not for me.
