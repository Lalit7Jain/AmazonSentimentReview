Amazon doesn't repair any of it's devices.  Period.  Only replacement. I didn't know that until today. After 2 years you're toast.  I'm not happy.  In the past year I have gotten a 2016 Dot 2, a 2017 Tap, a 2015 Kindle Fire HDX - I recently bought Kindles for gifts (Kindle tablets suck).  What a waste.  Never again will I buy any Amazon technology.  Ever.
