I use my Echo to voice control lighting in my home, as well as temperature with my Nest, Alexa is also great for trivia and traffic/weather updates. The lady of the house uses it as a Bluetooth speaker (which was how I tricked her into letting me purchase one for our living room). The kids can use it for simple questions when they are working on school work (but rarely do they). It'd be nice if the included power cable were a little longer, if it could handle more complex instructions (do X and Y, or do this then that), or if the remote had been included, but these are all minor issues that don't detract from the overall experience.
