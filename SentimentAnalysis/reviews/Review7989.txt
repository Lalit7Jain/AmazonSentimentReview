I am pretty disappointed with this device. Good if you want it to set a timer or tell you what the weather is. Bad answering the kinds of questions that you might google....even simple stuff. Maybe if I invest in home technology my opinion will change. But I already own a thermostat from Honeywell that is supposed to work with the device, but I can't get it to connect. It can't access iTunes only Amazon music. Well sorry. I have a large ITunes library and I am not going to repurchase all my music. It does have access to my audible library but so does my iPhone which is connected to my jambox. So it's kind of a one-joke application and I can't say it was worth the investment.
