Worst piece of garbage I have ever used.  The sound is lack luster.  The voice recognition, good luck.  I was the only one in my family to get her to work.  Unable to find music on Amazon using Alexa, even though I could find it on my tablet and make it play.  Amazon's own device doesn't know what amazon does or doesn't have.  Alexa unfortunately makes Siri look like a genius, (Siri is utter garbage).  I recommend this product to no one.  Our echo became a shotgun target.  Most fun we had with the device.
