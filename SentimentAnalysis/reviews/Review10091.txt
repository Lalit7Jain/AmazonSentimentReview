4.  Items 1-3 above are not major issues that would cost the review more than one star combined.  The fact that I cannot connect the output from the Echo to my Bluetooth audio receiver, however, is a full star deduction.  Seems intuitive that the unit should have both transmit and receive functions at this price point.
