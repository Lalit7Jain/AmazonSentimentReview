I bought my first Echo before it was first released for sale. I wasn't sure how I would use it and I thought my wife would think...just another gadget. She immediately fell in love with it and wanted her own which was bought sometime later when it was fully released for sale. We now have third unit in another area of the house. It's a great device that has so much potential that we haven't begun to tap it's full potential. It's very reliable and sounds great. Alexa has a lot to learn and  it seems her capability is ever expanding.
