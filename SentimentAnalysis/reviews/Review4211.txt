One unhappy customer. Out of the blue my echo quit working. It wouldn't stay connected to the internet and the light circled blue continuously. Called customer support 4 times. At one point after factory reset it worked for a few hours but went back to not working. Called again and they sent me a new cord. Plugged in and worked for about 1/2 hour and then stopped again. Called back and because it's warranty had run out best they could do was offer me a new one for $112.
