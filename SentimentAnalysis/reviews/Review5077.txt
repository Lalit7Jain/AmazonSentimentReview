You need to subscribe to a monthy music service to really enjoy personal music selections on demand. Otherwise you can use Pandora, iHeart radio and others over any bluetooth speaker or the music channels you get with your cable TV subscriber. It is like a razor. the initial purchase is ok, but the replacement blades (and in this case a monthly music service provider) adds a monthly cost like rent.
