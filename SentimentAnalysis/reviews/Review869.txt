Absolutely awesome product. I got this for my home theater setup so I can use it with Harmony and it works absolutely flawless. It's really nice because all my wife has to do is walk in and do voice commands and everything within my home theater setup will easily be controlled by Harmony and the Amazon Echo. I highly recommend this for anybody who likes hands-free functionality for all your home theater and pretty much any other needs.
