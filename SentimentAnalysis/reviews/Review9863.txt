The main issue is its voice activation command process. It is very unreliable. Sometimes it hears perfectly from another end of the room and sometimes it does not react at all, even from 3 feet away. I sometimes have to raise my voice, which is very bad for my throat. And, the most unpleasant part is the alarm. It is almost impossible to stop the alarm without screaming, because the device does not hear you! If there is a source of a noise in a room, than most likely it will not react to the commands as well.
