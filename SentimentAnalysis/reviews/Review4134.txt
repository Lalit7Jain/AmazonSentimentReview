Great for playing music (Spotify) in my bedroom, and for controlling the lamps and thermostat linked to my smart home system. I enjoy playing Jeopardy and being able to get updated weather and traffic information. The voice recognition works well, even if I'm not in the same room. I'm very satisfied with my purchase!
