I purchased my Echo from Best Buy last month, and I have been using it on a daily basis since then. The integration with Philips Hue and IFTTT makes this vastly more valuable. The ability to control lights all over the house by voice commands is invaluable, and I've set up an IFTTT recipe to blink my Hue lights when an Echo timer runs out (so that I don't miss it if I have headphones on).
