Can not understand what the big deal is with alexa I bought it about 3 months ago at Lowe's and if she answers 2 out of 10 questions that's a lot just today ask it how to remove perspiration stains from clothing got no answer I asked Google and got the answer and this is with most of the answers alexa can't answer Google answers. I personally don't think it is worth the money and friends that have tried mine are looking more towards Google.
