Let me preface this review by stating that I want to love this product. I'm a huge supporter of all things Amazon. I've been a Prime member for many years, I adore Prime Music and stream it everywhere (and spread the word to others), I also make most of my purchases on the site, from clothing to appliances. I own several Fire TV devices, and have used every Amazon service available in my area (can't wait until Fresh comes to Austin). So needless to say, I've been really looking forward to getting an Echo and setting up a "smart" home. I even bought the new Amazon Music Unlimited to use with my Echo setup. Unfortunately, I've so far been extremely underwhelmed by the unit.
