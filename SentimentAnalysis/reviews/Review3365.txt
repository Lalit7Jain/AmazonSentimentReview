Well not a whole lot to say. I really like my Echo..I think anyone who buys one will too. Alexis is one smart piece of software.. I see Google trying to sell one. Dont5know theirs but I can only say if you don't own an Echo your truely missing out. It does my thermostat like I ask. It's great. I want to hear what ever song or group it plays it. The sound you'd think is Bose it's totally incredible!!..
