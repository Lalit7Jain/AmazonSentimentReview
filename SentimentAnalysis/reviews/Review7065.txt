For Christmas, I bought both an Echo and a Dot.  We'll keep the dot.  It's located in the bedroom and understands things like "Alexia - play thunderstorm sounds", which helps my wife get to sleep. However, "Alexia - play thunderstorm sounds for 10 minutes" doesn't work because while Alexia will play the thunderstorm sounds, it has total disregard for the time limit.
