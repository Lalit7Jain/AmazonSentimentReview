Purchased a refurbished Echo today and used free same day shipping.  I was super excited to get started using it, went to plug it in, and found the plug was way to large.  Called customer service, and they were happy to reimburse the funds to order another cord, but didn't seem to believe the cord didn't fit at first.  I finally looked up the model number for the power cord, and it it for a first generation Amazon Fire media streaming device.  I give this three stars at this point not due to any fault with the Echo itself, but because the refurbished unit was packaged with the wrong power cord, and it took 30 minutes to explain the problem and get the rep to believe me, and to add insult to injury, they wouldn't even upgrade my order to one day shipping.  I love Amazon, but am disappointed.
