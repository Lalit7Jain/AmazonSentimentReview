I received the ECHO as a gift and it would not connect to the internet.  Customer support replaced it with another.  Same problem, it would not connect to the internet.  Customer support replaced the device with another ECHO.  Same problem, same error codes as before telling me the internal clock could not be reset.  This time customer support sent me a refund.  Oh for three, that was enough for me.
