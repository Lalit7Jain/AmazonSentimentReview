I'd like to start with how much of an Amazon fan I am! I was completely Anti-Google Home from the beginning. When I first got the echo, I loved it. But as I slowly started to use it more, I noticed where it is lacking features. When setting up my Hue lights, I was forced to download the IFTTT app and run my lights through there instead of directly through the Alexa app. It was very glitchy and limited on the voice feature when controlling the lights. That by itself was not a deal breaker so I dealt with it. As I continued to experiment and ask more questions, Alexa continued to say "Sorry, I do not know the answer to that question." I think what finally made me make the switch was getting a gift card for Xmas. I figured I'd return the Echo and try the Google Home. When I received the Google Home, the setup was very easy and I was able to link my Hue lights directly to my device without having to download a third party app. I'd say the Google Home also has more "Personality" and is much more funny. It also has trivia games and is much more interactive with my kids. She also knows the answer to basically any question that Alexa would not. I'm assuming that's because it uses Google to find the answers. Overall, the Echo was okay, but the Google Home is by far superior and is only getting better with each update.
