The Echo is working just as described. I'm surprised at how well it interprets my requests. So far I  use it as an interactive music device, almanac, news -person and weatherman. I was concerned that the requests needed to be precisely worded but I have discovered that it permits much more flexibility than I would have guessed. I would purchase it again knowing what  I now know.
