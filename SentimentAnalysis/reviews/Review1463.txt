Oh my God! Can't say enough how I love my Alexa Echo. I am only just scratching the surface of what she can do, and more skills are added daily. There is no way to keep up, I just pick and choose whats relevant to me. She's almost has a personality just suited to me and sorta like a real person when I interact with her. (Don't realky know how to explain it.) I think in a few years most everyone will be using technology like this as a matter of course, just like how cell phones evolved and became a tool we all take for granted now.
