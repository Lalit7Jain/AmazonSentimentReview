My husband purchased this as a Christmas gift for "me." It's perfect for the whole family. We mainly use it for music. (If you're in the same boat, pay the extra monthly fee for the Amazon library. We hardly ever come across a song she can't play. That includes a wide variety of Disney and children's music.) At times, she doesn't work as well as others. Maybe too much background noise. Overall, she's a fun addition to our home for music, weather updates and games. I'm excited to see what else she can do.
