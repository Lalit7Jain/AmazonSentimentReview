We love our Alexa, we have alot of work to do with her yet since we just got her. She is already turning on my livingroom lamp lol. Alot of questions she can't answer yet, but we are working on that. There are so many apps for her on you can't remember all of them. You have to ask her to open a app before she can answer a question pertaining to that app it is a bit frustrating. I am sure we will get there. One thing for sure as far as playing music she has awesome speakers.....
