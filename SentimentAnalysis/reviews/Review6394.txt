The echo sounds good and we love the skills on it. But we bought my mother in law an echo dot for Christmas with a JBL charge 2 speaker. We were going to get another echo but it would not arrive until after Christmas. When we paired the JBL speaker to her echo dot the sound was great. Much better than the sound of the echo speaker.  the sound was fuller and more clear plus she can move her speaker anywhere she is working in the house. The other part is it was $30 cheaper to buy the echo dot and JBL speaker compared to the echo. We are sending the echo back and ordering the echo dot and jbl speaker.
