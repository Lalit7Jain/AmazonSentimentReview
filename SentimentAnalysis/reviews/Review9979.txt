We have had this for a couple months now and the sound as the speakers have broken in has only gotten better. I am still impressed at the quality of the sound for such a small device. I have a Denon AVR with a seven speaker set-up and I find myself asking Echo to play music instead because any music in the Prime library is just a question away from playing. I am listening to a Tom Petty mix as I write this and it no doubt uses less energy then firing up the 95w/channel Denon. The Denon has become mostly a movie device now. The timer function continues to be very useful use almost daily feature. The other day I had two timers running at the same time.
