Based on the advertisement, I expected a lot more functionality.  A friend has it and we were amazed that it could play music, answer questions, etc.  It seems that the functionality only works if you have Amazon Prime (we do not).  And it can't do simple arithmetic.  I would have been better off with the google version.
