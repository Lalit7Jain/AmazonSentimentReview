already had to replace it twice and now I can't replace the 2ND DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. I just threw away $190.00 on a product that will not work after 6 weeks. This happened with my Kindle I had to replace it 5 times before I got one that worked. Unfortunately now, I wasted almost $200 on a product that will not work. Save yourself the money and aggravation: GOOGLE HOME IS CHEAPER, SO TRY THAT FIRST BEFORE YOU WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE. Echo, is defective.
