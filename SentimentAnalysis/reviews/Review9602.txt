Very easy to use for all ages. Full of information. From checking the weather, to finding out what movies are out, to playing music, and ordering essentials. I am amazed at all of the capabilities this small cylinder offers. Huge timesaver. Instead of staring at a device, wasting time trying to find out information, now we just ask Alexa!
