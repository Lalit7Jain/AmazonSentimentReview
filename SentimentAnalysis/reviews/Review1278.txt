I bought my ECHO to function primarily as an alarm clock. Amazon advertises that it can do this. Unfortunately Amazon didn't mention that there was a known issue with the time not always being correct. When daylight savings time went into effect my alarm never went off causing me to be late for work. Customer service was prompt and admitted to there being a problem, but only gave the general "we are working on the problem, but have no idea how long it will take to fix."  As an alarm clock Echo is a 1 star because I can't trust it. The second star is because it's nice as a music source. Though on rare occasions it refuses to play. Echo also can't hear commands when the volume is to high, negating voice commands as an option. Nice idea, but needs work.
