DO NOT RELY ON THE ECHO'S ALARM!!!  I have had the Echo for almost a year.  Overall I like it. I use it as my wake up alarm every morning.  USUALLY, it works, but not always.  Three times since I got it I have set the alarm for the following morning and it simply failed to go off.  Each time this happened, the Echo had acknowledged back to me that my alarm was set for the requested time. And for each of the three times the alarm failed to work, I have not been able to figure out what went wrong.  The device's alarm function is simply UNRELIABLE. If you are going to use the Echo to set an alarm, make sure you have a backup alarm set as well.  The alarm feature, which should be rock solid, is instead very disappointing, and two out of the three times it did not go off for me, caused me to be late for work.
