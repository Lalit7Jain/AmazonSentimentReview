We got this a couple of weeks ago, and it's been fun. We are still learning about Alexa's capabilities, and though there are more than a few things that she doesn't seem to understand, it might be the way we are asking the questions also. The speaker is awesome, and really fills the room when we play music! All in all, a good purchase.
