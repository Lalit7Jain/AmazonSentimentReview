First to review how the order arrived. it arrived SO late. It should have arrived Nov 26, 2016 but instead it arrived only last night at 7pm Dec. 2, 2016.  And we are Prime members, so it should have arrived in 2 days. The other product I ordered arrived on time and that was dispatched via USPS. We were so ready to cancel and forego the order if it still has not arrived. The carrier used was UPS..so go figure...whatever it was it is overwhelmingly delayed.
