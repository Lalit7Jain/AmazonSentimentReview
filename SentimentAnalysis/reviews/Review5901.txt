There were certainly some cadence issues when I first used the Echo (you can't be like " Hey Alexa...er..ah..erm..oh!..play X on spotify" because she is so totally over you by then. Perhaps this device teaches you to think before you speak? And to be decisive in commanding what you want out of life. Wow. Deep
