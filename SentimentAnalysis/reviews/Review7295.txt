Usability sucks as it seems that I constantly have to pull out my phone to 'enable' it to do something, which I thought the point of this thing was to be hands-free?  Allrecipes.com seemed like a cool integration, but you have to get out your phone, go to the app, find the "skill", enable it, hope that it works...but that's not enough - you need to connect it to your allrecipes.com account and if you don't have one then you'll have to create one.... I just want to know what I can make with my leftover egg whites, or what I can substitute for soy sauce.
