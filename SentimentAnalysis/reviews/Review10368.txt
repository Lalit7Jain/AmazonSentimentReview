Best purchase ever!  I just got  Alexa yesterday and I love it.  Set up took 5 minutes or less.  Plugged her in, downloaded the App and followed the prompts to connect her to Wi-Fi and my Amazon account.  We were talking like old friends in minutes.  I'm so impressed. The sound quality is awesome.  I enjoyed listening to my Prime music and my ITunes music (I imported my iTunes music into my Prime Library).  I can also listen to my IPod via the Bluetooth connection if I want.  Alexa walked my thru the Bluetooth set up.  Set up for Bluetooth was the easiest than any other device I have tried in the past (Bose Bluetooth set up took many tries).  I'm impressed with just listening to music at this point.  I know there are other features to fall in love with.  I can't wait to play with her some more.  I would recommend to anyone..
