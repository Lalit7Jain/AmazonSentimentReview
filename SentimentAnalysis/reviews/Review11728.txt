I vacillate between 2 and 3 stars and if I am perfectly honest it should probably be 2.  I really, really want to like this Amazon's Echo.  I love the premise of it but it's really not meeting my expectations.  Simple questions like "Alexa, when did the first Ghost Buster's movies come out" can't be answered.  She more often than not tells you to go the app where you're then directed to look something up on Bing.  The timer and alarm function have proved useful.  We've only been using it for a few days so this is just a first reaction.  We'll see how it goes as I start using it for a speaker for music (so far attempts to do so have failed) and for our schedule.  I'll update the review and rating as we go along.  My plan was to get the echo for family members for Christmas but at this point I think I"m not likely to do that.  Not as cool a product as I had originally hoped.
