KIDS LOVE IT. Nuff  Said.  Bought a Dot too my 12 year old uses it to go to sleep,  he was a problem going to sleep So he plays Enya or relaxing music, for bed time.  we bought a better small speaker for the Dot.  we are getting 2 more Dots witch will make 4 Dots and 1 Echo.  Oh and if you ask it Wiki questions it will answer for my kids Homework.  LOVE IT.
