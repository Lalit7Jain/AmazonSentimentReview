I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY ECHO! The sound that comes from this little gadget is a pleasant surprise and it can be turned  WAY UP! I thought that it would be great for music, which it is. However, I've added the "to do list", used it for alarms, get the weather, news reports, asked a multitude of questions. The list goes on! This is such a wonderful addition to my home! I will eventually add the items to make it control some lights and TVs in my house as well, as time goes on.
