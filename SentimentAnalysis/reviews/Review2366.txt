Started using it about a month ago. The calendar will only work with Google. Can't seem to switch it to another. The weather coordinates I cannot reset. Sometimes Alexa doesn't respond. You need to buy a lot of dots to make it work throughout your house. Only very few basic amenities are provided with this hundred $180 machine. Very bad experience. A gift I don't think I can get a return on now even though I have let amzon know of my problems.
