Product arrived in mint condition, shipping was suppose to be one day shipping but arrived 3 days late, Alexa app is un responsive and crashes frequently causing me to have to uninstall and reinstall to work properly. Other than that amazing product, speakers are very good and surprising for such small size, bass and treble are balanced.
