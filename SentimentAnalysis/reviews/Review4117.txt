So as I said this may sound negative, but I am not negative on the Echo environment. For now, it is doing what I needed (room filling music) and has some useful everyday features that are helpful (calendar, lists, news, weather and internet radio).  I’ve rated it 4 stars taking 0.5 off for the non-linear volume and another 0.5 for inability to play music on selected or all devices.  The latter is something I think will be fixed as it matures and the former may or not be correctable at this price point. So take the plunge, get your feet wet and see how it fits into your life.  If you are an Amazon Prime member, this is a great way to access your music library.
