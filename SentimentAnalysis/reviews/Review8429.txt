You gotta love these things, and the refurbished one was just like new at a really reasonable price.  If you want  high quality sound, however, buy the Dot and pair it with a high-end BlueTooth speaker (the Bose SoundTouch 30 is great!).  If you want total convenience and reasonable sound quality, however, this is the one to buy.
