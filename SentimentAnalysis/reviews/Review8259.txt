In home automation, another mildly annoying missing feature is the ability to set specific colors for smart bulbs. You can turn them off and on, or dim them a specific amount, but color change is completely absent. Also, you would expect multiple Echo units spread throughout your house, with built-in microphones and speakers, to be able to act as an intercom. At the very least, it should be able to recognize and relay a spoken message to all other units in the house. Multiple units on the same WiFi network should be able to communicate with one another and perform useful tasks as a group. Buying 5 of these devices gives you zero extra functionality versus buying just 1. There is zero communication between siblings. In fact, if you have already set up one Echo on your home network, that first Echo should automatically set up any new units you add. You shouldn't have to open the app and go through the entire setup process for each unit individually.
