We were looking for a bluetooth speaker for the kitchen, noticed that Alexa was having a birthday and the price was very reasonable, and decided to give her a try. We don't use it as much as we thought (I still use my Okay Google commands for productivity), but I love listening to my custom news feed in the mornings while I get coffee and breakfast going for the family. My wife loves it to play her music (which is why we were in the market for a BT speaker in the first place), and the kids love the more silly skills that Alexa has to offer... you'll know what I'm talking about if you do just a small bit of exploring in the skills library. :P
