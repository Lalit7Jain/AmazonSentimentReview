This is something that turned out to be so fun for my family, I am very happy with it. I wasn't sure if it would even be used but it is used by all in the house.  I have even been in my car @ times wishing I had Alexa there to ask questions or order things for me as I was driving. This technology will be in cars in the future I am sure.  I plan to order more echo's or the echo dot for different rooms.
