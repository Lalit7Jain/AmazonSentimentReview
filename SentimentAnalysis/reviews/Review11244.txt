Hands down the best item I've ever bought through amazon. Yes it's changed my life. It has become a family tradition to sit down for dinner and have Alexa give us the news or randomly dance to music for fun. Setting timers for cooking and even finding my phone if it's lost. I've brought her across the country when we moved and our home felt complete when we plugged her in and she said "Hello"  You won't regret this purchase.
