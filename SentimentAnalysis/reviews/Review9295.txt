I love my Echo, had some issues with internet connectivity and it caused all sorts of weird things, like randomly stop playing music, speaker popping, unable to answer questions, etc.  Lots of weird stuff...  I ordered a replacement device after customer service recommended it since it seemed like it just was defective.  The replacement was doing the same thing, I played with my router settings and joined the frequencies and that solved my issues.
