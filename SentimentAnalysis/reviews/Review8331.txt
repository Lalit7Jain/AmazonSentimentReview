I like my amazon echo, because I mainly use it as a speaker in the kitchen. I really haven't dug too deeply into all the features it has. I was hoping for something that had more of a "siri" type engine, that I could just ask questions about anything and get answers. Alexa does a lot better when using the apps they have available. If I had a smart home, I'd be thrilled, I heard it does well there.
