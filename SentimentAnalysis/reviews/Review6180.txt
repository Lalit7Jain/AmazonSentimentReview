Echo finds great info but you have to tell "her" to go to Wikipedia.  Also she can operate two accounts on Amazon Prime and switch easily between them.  She tracks packages bought which is also helpful. She can find you recipes when you're cooking.  And responds well to voice commands - a bit better than Dot which needed to be reset twice.
