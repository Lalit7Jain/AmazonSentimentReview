Love this device.  I keep it in my kitchen and daily ask it to update me on the weather and the daily news headlines.  I also use it to play music from Amazon Prime music and to set timers as I cook.  Alexa can do lots of cool things like tell jokes when asked and sing "Happy Bday."  Love having Alexa as my personal assistant!
