When bored, I ask Alexa to tell me a joke and she tells me a silly joke. Alexa learns more skills as time passes and I don't wish to list them all, but some skills are more useful than others. For example, Alexa will compliment you all day long if you ask her to. It might make you feel good about yourself coming from a computer, or not, but it's entertaining if your bored.
