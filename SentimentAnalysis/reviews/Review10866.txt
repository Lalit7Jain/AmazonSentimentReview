I've invested quite a bit into TP-Link smart plugs and wifi light bulbs, my biggest issue with home automation is that Alexa doesn't always make the device turn on, even with her signature confirmation "ok", my table lamp is still off, so I've had to ask a second and even third time. The other issue is that she can't always find the device and/or doesn't understand the name you assigned the device. This should be simple, but she confuses simple words like bureau, night stand, fan, etc. So you'll get the I'm sorry routine. Sometimes I want to just manually turn my lights and accessories on from the sheer frustration!!!!!!!! Yelling at her obviously won't help and at some point you forget your talking to a computer!! Her voice recognition and parsing, particularly with my above mentioned devices is troublesome, and I do not fault third parties. I've named each device properly, checking the spelling, renaming, and researching issues....sometimes she just won't understand. I have gone through the voice training process, my English and diction are just fine as well, you'll have to trust me on that, lol.
