The product is great to use for music, cooking, weather, news, etc.  Before I received it I watched a short highly-rated video on YouTube to assure I was taking advantage of the items full potential. Also, with all the 'hubs' out there, I find it interesting they decline to sell 'no hub' items at large retailers.  I'll go into this later in this review, but feel many complementary smart home products are money-making scheme. Spend your hard-earned money on the Echo, don't waste it on unnecessary additives.
