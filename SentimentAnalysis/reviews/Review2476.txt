Great sound. Great for playing music, or controlling your home. Don't expect Alexa to answer any questions you have though. "sorry, I don't know the answer" is a common response. Obviously google home is going to have great access to google but can't Alexa at least TRY. Amazon needs to fix this lack of search response if I'm going to keep my echo and not switch to google home.
