What can I say that has not been said before. Just received my second unit for the bedroom. I like how new things and updates are added to this great product.Imagine in years to come where all this is going. What about how this helps people with certain disability's. I believe that I chose the right brand to go with. I am seeing other companies jumping on board the Amazon Echo train that's a good sign.
