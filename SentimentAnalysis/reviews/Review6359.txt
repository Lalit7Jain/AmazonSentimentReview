Overall the device works well.  The issue I have is with Alexa software.  It does fine giving the news or weather and playing music but any search or question we ask it almost always can never find the answer.  Examples: Who won the Stanley Cup in 2016!!!!!  Does an apple contain Vitamin C? What temperature to cook beef to? Which recording artist won the most Grammy's?  What recording artist sold the most albums?  Simple question and she responded "Sorry I don't have the answer to that question"  We have asked the questions several different ways to see if she can answer and we get the same response.  These are just a few of the hundred questions we have asked her since Christmas.  I found it is easier to just look the answers up on my phone or the computer.  If they could work out the "bugs" and have her answer these simple questions it would be great.  But for now she is just a radio.
