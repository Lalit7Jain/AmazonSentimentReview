- Although the microphone is really good, it still doesn't do the best if you aren't in the room with it unless there is no other noise in the house. (being a father of 2 girls this never happens) BUT, you can link up to 3 echo's together so you can place multiple echo's inside your house. Just be careful not to have them too close together or you might end up with some funky command deal going on.
