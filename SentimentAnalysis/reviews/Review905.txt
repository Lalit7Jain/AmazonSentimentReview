Then the third-party skills (Amazon's word for "apps"). Ugh. Frustrating that skills are a pain to enable (you can't do it by voice), and that the "skills marketplace" is filled with half-baked dreck. Some quality control and real developers could go a long way toward improving that. The search is bad. The skills are mostly bad ideas. Then you find one that's a good idea, and there aren't enough reviews to tell if it's any good or not. The only one I've found that I didn't promptly forget is the "Where in the World?" geography trivia quiz skill, and even that's not perfect.
