If I could return this waste of money I would.  It is just another form of ordering Amazon products - forget the voice recognition features - Alexa cannot understand simple English words, commands, often screwing up basic functions I bought this device for.  And for recognizing music names - she is horrible. Often say one thing and she does another - will stop playing a favorite song or will just order some product. She is more an Amazon cash register than anything.  Other than setup commands from Amazon's TV commercials or simple ones (weather, traffic) she performs a 2 on a scale of 1-10. Horrible product, disappointing for a company that usually makes great items.  The whole get in the bed with Amazon for everything is a little much, and failed miserably.  I own a G Home device and am so much happier.
