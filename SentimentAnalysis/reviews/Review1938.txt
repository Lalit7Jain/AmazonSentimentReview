I purchased this as a gift for my husband. We were excited to use it.  Very disappointing! It never could understand the questions we asked. Even when we were using it for lists it said it couldn't understand what we were asking, let alone what we wanted to add to the grocery list.The only thing it could consistently understand is our request for the day's weather.  Sent it back.
