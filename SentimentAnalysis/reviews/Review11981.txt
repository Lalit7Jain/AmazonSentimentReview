Echo is cool product and does the basics pretty well. It can quickly answer questions about weather, traffic and even order an Uber for you. The main detractor I have is that it is not very conversational. If there are different smart lights you want Alexa to turn on I have to issue the request one after the other. It would be really nice to say "Alexa turn on the Hallway and bedroom lights. Hopefully this will be one of the updates that rolls out in the future. I also wish Alexa had a larger database to answer questions...I expect this to be fixed with time.
