Bought this originally for my wife but secretly for myself... as it turns out, she did not want it and I got to keep it. At this point I am in the discovery stages. Still trying to figure out uses for it other than to ask for answers to trivia questions or play music. I know it is capable of much more and will be fun to explore the possibilities.
