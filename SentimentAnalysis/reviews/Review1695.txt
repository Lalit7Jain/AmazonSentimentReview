My while family loves Alexa. If she had feelings I'm sure she would say we get on her nerves. I would be cautious with her and the kids, my son had her do all his math problems...lol...The only down side would be that she is not able to answer every question. I was under the impression that she would just google questions and provide the answer. But for the most part she gets the job done
