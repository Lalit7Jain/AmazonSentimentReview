I was skeptical about purchasing an echo, but I got a refurbished one in the event I didn't like it.  It works well and is great telling about my local weather each morning so I am prepared for the day without waiting to see the forecast on television.  My family enjoys asking her all sorts of things while at my house. I have to admit I haven't used it for much else.  We'll see where the skills go in the future that may make me use it more often.
