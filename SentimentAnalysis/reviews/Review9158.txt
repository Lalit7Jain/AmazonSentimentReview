My father is 81 and I have a difficult time buying him gifts.  I bought this for my mom and dad as an early Christmas present and they love it!  My dad shows it to all of his friends and loves that he can request and hear songs from many years ago.  I think he likes it better than my mom, but it was a great gift!
