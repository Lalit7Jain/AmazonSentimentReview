I love Alexa, specifically when I want to listen to music. The sound from the Echo is great, and connects easily to other blue tooth devices. We alos purchased Amazon prime to get loads of music, some good videos, and 2-day shipping.  Unfortunately, Amazon has a long way to go to equal the search capabilities of Google.  Many of my questions are heard correctly, as verified in my Alex app, but Alexa just doesn't deliver the answers. When Alexa "does not understand" my question, I go to my phone and "ask Google" the same exact question and Google responds perfectly 9 out of 10 times.  I almost wish I purchased Google Home, but I am willing to give Alexa a few months.
