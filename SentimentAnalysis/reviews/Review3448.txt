The echo itself is great.  Cool, useful, great sound.  The app that you need to do things like add skills or access your shopping list at the store is awful.  It drops offline, freezes, and becomes unresponsive to the point that it's useless.  If all you want is a music streaming device, the echo works.  If you want to do anything else, you'll need the app and Amazon has really dropped the ball on that
