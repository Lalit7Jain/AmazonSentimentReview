I want something as simple as telling Alexa to remember my birthday and store it in her database of useful facts for me.  I want to tell her the birthday of my wife and to record that she likes a certain type of flowers.  Then as it gets closer, I want to ask Alexa if she has any deals for me relating to birthday gifts for my wife and I want Alexa to offer to buy flowers for my wife.  That's what a personal assistant does.
