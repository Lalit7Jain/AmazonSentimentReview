I have enjoyed my Echo. Alexa tells me the time of day and the local weather, plays my favorite radio stations, Audible books and games. I no longer need a bedside clock or radio. I am still learning what all she will do. She doesn't always understand what I am saying, but that's OK. I still think this is a great product.
