I love having all the music at my voice command.  I love being able to listen to radio stations around the world or my favorite NPR station nearby. I love telling Alexa (whom I call Echo), "Play gentle Christmas music," and she does!  I love telling Echo to play the Beatle's White Album, and she does!  It's easy to control the volume, either by talking to Echo or using the Alexa phone app.  The sound coming from this small item is great, and it sounds good whether on a low volume for background music or a loud volume so it can be heard a couple of rooms away.
