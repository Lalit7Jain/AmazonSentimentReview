I never thought about buying this but so glad we did. I have been training Alexa to monitor our Nest products and listening to her jokes. The wife and I love this and wish we would have bought it sooner. We are still learning how to use Alexa and this is the fun part about it. Love the music and the sound from this little unit. Very nice. Go ahead and get one as you will be glad you did.
