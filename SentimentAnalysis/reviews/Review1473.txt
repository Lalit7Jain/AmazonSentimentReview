We love Alexa!  Since she came into our lives we listen to a lot more music.  The quality of the sound is great for us and she responses beautifully to our questions.  Everyday we hear a new "PG-13" joke that makes us laugh.  Our home is >1000 sq. ft. and we can hear her throughout.  Perfect for us!
