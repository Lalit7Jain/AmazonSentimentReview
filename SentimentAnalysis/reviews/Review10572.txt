I bought this refurbished. After the initial set up, I was having problems with the echo playing anything (music, radio stations, etc) that wasn't in Alexa's voice. I got a little frustrated, because you know, refurb, but after unplugging and waiting a few seconds to plug it back in, it works like a charm.
