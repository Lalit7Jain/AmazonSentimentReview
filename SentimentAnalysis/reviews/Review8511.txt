have an answer I thought she'd be smarter like Cortana. I asked Alexa what was Ullyses Grant's first name was and she said Ullyses  NOT!!!!!!  It was Hiram? I have had a great time listening to Alexa and I got her as a gift so I am happy with her,  I also would like to be able to use the app from my computer not just my phone which could break down and then I am not able to change items in Alexa. That is a drawback because I use my computer much more than my phone.
