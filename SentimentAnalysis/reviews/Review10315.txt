I enjoy my Amazon Echo. This product offers an abundance of use. I continue to learn it's capability. As a matter of fact, emails are sent to me regularly to notify me of the things this product can do. I mostly listen to music with it. You can ask Alexa to play anything you like. She can tell you the top news, weather, directions, etc.... basically anything you want to know.  I ask for the best route to work as I'm about to walk out of the door in the morning to avoid traffic.  You can even program the echo to sync with other electronics in your house. The uses are endless. My mom enjoyed it so much on her last visit to my house that she's buying one for herself.
