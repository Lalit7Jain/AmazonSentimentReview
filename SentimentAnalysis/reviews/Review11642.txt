I have an echo in the den, the living room, and the bedroom. The Dot allows me to use a Bluetooth speaker I can take into the bathroom when I shower, or the backyard. I bought a battery for one of the big Echos so I can bring that into the kitchen when I cook. I have music everywhere now. I fire up music whenever I'm not watching TV.
