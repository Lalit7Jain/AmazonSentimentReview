I have two. One downstairs and and one upstairs. We have only had them for a few days, but it has been great fun. Each morning I get my "news flash" downstairs while I have my coffee and each night I hear my "news flash" upstairs when we go to bed. I check the weather forecast, outside temperature, and control the living room lights with Alexa. The speaker is excellent and we have played music using Pandora. I also am using an app with Alexa and my iPhone that syncs a shopping list. All I have to say is "Alexa, go to "OurGroceries" and add *laundry soap*" and the item shows up in the app on my iPhone. When you get the item, touch it and it is crossed off. Never forget to purchase something again. It takes practice--and a lot of laughs--to ask the questions the proper way, but we have enjoyed it and both Alexa and I will get better with time at getting the right questions for the right answers.
