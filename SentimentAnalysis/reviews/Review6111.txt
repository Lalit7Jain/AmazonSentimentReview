We got this as a gift and we absolutely love it. I love the shopping list feature-I tell Alexa what to add to me list and I can pull it up while shopping. I tell her good morning and she will give me a small history lesson on what happened that day x amount years ago. My 14 month old son will dance when he sees it because we play music through it all the time. We highly recommend getting one.
