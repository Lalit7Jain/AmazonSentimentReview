The programing screw up around daylight savings changeover is just beyond understanding. My unit did not make the changeover at 2am like all of my other devices so my alarm didn't go off in the morning to wake me up. Luckily I had another device set to wake me for work that day. Later when I investigated the error I discovered that my timezone had been erased so when I attempted to set the timezone it would not allow me. Apparently there is a time zone for America and a time zone for US. If you select America you will consistently get your time zone reset. If you live in the US you must select US for your country. When I asked text support what country America was I did not really get any sort of answer. I find that such an incredible oversight and amateurish mistake that I just can't seem to wrap my head around it. This is the kind of crap that happens when you source your programming work out to a third world country. I certainly hope Amazon can address this not just short term but long-term if they hope to maintain their hold on the AI device market. That being said other than this current issue that was resolved I really do like my echo device.
