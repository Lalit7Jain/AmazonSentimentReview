I love my Echo. I set timers, check sports scores, weather, listen to my favorite jams and tons more just by using my voice. I also have the Wemo outlet to turn lighting on & off with my voice command. I purchased a full size Echo and Echo dot as christmas gifts and they are both loved as much as I love mine. My 5yr old enjoys asking Alexa for jokes and easily turning on his own jams
