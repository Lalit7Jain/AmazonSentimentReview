Still learning life with Alexa. The sound is great I listen to both Amazon music and Bluetooth music and audio books from my iPhone. Works with Hue lights. Tech has come a long way. Alexa keeps track of what I need from the grocery store. I talk and she puts it on my shopping list. It's kind of strange that Alexa feels like a member of the family.
