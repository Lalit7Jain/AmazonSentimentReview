I have only been using it a couple of days, but so far Alexa is lightyears ahead of Siri and has done a great job responding to my requests. I do wish I could use Alexa to open apps on my phone without having to unlock my iphone, but there seem to be "skills" to activate to cover most of my frequently used applications which helps!
