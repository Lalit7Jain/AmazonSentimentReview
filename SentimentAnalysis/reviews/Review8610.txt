Got this because I wanted a bluetooth speaker in the living room for when i'm cleaning or entertaining, and figured why not one I can talk to. Glad I did. I don't find it that "usefull" as much as a novelty, great conversation peice of tech, and makes me feel like I'm on the starship enterprise. I just wish I could call it "computer" instead of alexa to get it to respond.
