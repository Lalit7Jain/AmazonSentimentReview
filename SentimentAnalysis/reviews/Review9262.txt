This device will record every single command that you use. You can view your history in Echo settings and listen to your voice. It creeped me out at the first time I found it, because I missed this aspect of the product when I was doing my research. I guess it makes sense though, that is how Alexa "learns" to recognize your voice more accurately. And on the bright side, you can delete anything you want and there is also a way to disable this feature altogether if it bothers you.
