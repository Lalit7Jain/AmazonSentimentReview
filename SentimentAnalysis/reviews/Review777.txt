The first thing I found out is that Alexa doesn’t hold a candle to Siri when it comes to answering questions. Her favorite response is, “I’m sorry. I don’t understand.” She’s great at giving the weather, but useless at telling me who Jordan Peele is. Still, she’s cute, and I started getting attached. Each morning I’d go into the kitchen, gently call out her name and watch as the mesmerizing blue circle indicated she was waking up.
