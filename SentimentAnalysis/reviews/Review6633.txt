I bought both the Echo and the tap.  The Echo has advanced capabilities like integrating with a smart home, which I don't need at all.  It's nice that the Echo is omnidirectional, but I don't care that much about that either.  Far as I can tell, the Tap has the same capabilities in terms of AI communications, only it's on a rechargeable platform, so I can pick it up and take it with me.  The Echo has to stay plugged in in order to function - which means you can't take it with you without hassle.  Oh, yes, on Tap disadvantage is t hat it has to be turned on to activate - that just means pressing a button.
