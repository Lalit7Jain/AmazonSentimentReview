Alexia is a great device all round, I use it almost everyday. However if you are expecting strong storms or other causes of power outages please unplug her. This morning we had a large storm blow through and when the power went off and came back on I was awoken to "hello" at 3 o'clock am. The dogs went crazy and as afraid as I Am to admit it it scared me a little to. So I love Alexia, but if you are expecting power outages UNPLUG her l. Or you will have hello being said through your house when you are the only one In it lt.
