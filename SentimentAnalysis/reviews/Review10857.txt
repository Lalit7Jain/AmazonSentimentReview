Alexa is always learning, but she definitely does not have her Master's degree quite yet, unfortunately Google's search engine is superior to that of the Bing powered Alexa. One can get frustrated when asking questions about simple subjects that a Google search will perform in 2 seconds or less, but this isn't a Google product, so my expectations are less. Often don't be surprised if you hear "Sorry I didn't understand the question I heard" We are so used to automation and the ability to get information from our devices instantly and accurately, Alexa is slowly catching up and closing the Gap.
