This device is awesome it has pulled all my home automation devices under one roof and simplified the use of these appliances I now control everything by voice there is a learning curve but it it was fairly simple to setup. It works very well and carries out all commands without fail the biggest issue I found was Echo like everything that requires wifi  must have a strong signal to work correctly I noticed that a few people gave Echo a bad review but I do not believe the device is at fault I too was having some problems on initial setup but once I stabilized my wifi all problems resolved themselves I continue to be amazed at how smart and useful Echo is. I held off making this purchase for a long time but am now truly glad I made the purchase Echo skills library grows on an almost daily basis and you would be amazed at how many skills I have found while reading articles about other devices it seems that for now Echo just keeps evolving. Very pleased and excited about this purchase.
