If it was possible to give this piece of crap 0 stars I would. To make it of any use its extra money. Couldn't even answer basic current events questions. Won't play music unless you have amizon prime ( more money). The only thing I could get out of it was the weather ( can stick my head out the door for that LOL) and it would calculate. So basically I had a 179.00 calculator. I called tech support and he worked with me for over an hr. He even brought in other people.  They determined it was not the unit and their comment was its new and we are improving it. It's 2  yrs old! That's obsolete in electronics years! And any way why would you bring out an incomplete product and expect your coustomers put up with the useless piece of crap while you try to fix it. We took it back after Xmas . Also it's ugly in person and did nothing but clutter up my counter. Junk Junk Junk.
