I have a love hate relationship with my echo. I love that it works w smartthings, ifttt, haiku fan and my other smart devices. However, I hate how she sometimes hears me, chimes in without being asked and I have been having major issues w the grocery list. Between adding items online or by the app, data gets lost and that can be frustrating. Also, I do not use it for music. My Sonos is SOOOOO much better.
