UPDATE:  Now the echo, after being unplugged for a couple weeks, refuses to power up at all.  So, contacted support again, and this time they issued me a return ticket.  So, I wouldn't say I'm recommending it, but it seems that if you just tell them that the device won't do anything, you can avoid the whole "basic troubleshooting for idiots" they try to put you through if you just tell them the device won't connect or other issues (other than the obligatory, "did you try it at another outlet").  Again, not saying this is the way to go to avoid that idiocy, but when the device won't power up, they seem to give up their efforts to make you feel like the defective product is your fault.
