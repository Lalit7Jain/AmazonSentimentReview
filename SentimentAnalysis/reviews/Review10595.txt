I’m rather disappointed concerning the Amazon Echo and was very much looking forward to using this in the home.  But after getting it and using it for several days the mic’s would not pic up all my voice commands even when I was standing next to it.  I also have 3 Dots and they instantly pic up my voice commands and requests, but don’t have the speaker output that the Echo has.  I’m with the return window and that’s what I’m doing.  Maybe the technology will improve more over time.
