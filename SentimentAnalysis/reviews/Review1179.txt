I got one of these for christmas and was excited to use but a few weeks later when I had the volume set on 5 and I tried to ask it a question using the voice command while listening to music it wouldn't respond to me and no matter what even if the music was playing quietly on my speaker it wouldn't listen even when I talked louder. Other than that it's great for music and other things
