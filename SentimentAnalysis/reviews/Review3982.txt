No she can't do the dishes either.  But what the Echo can do is amazing!  Save a few bucks and buy this refurbished model.  It looks and works as a brand new one does.  It comes with all cables and adaptors to get it up and running with your WiFi in Minutes.  The small manual is just the thing to get started.  Pick up a nice Book available here on Amazon, any one that trips your trigger, and you will soon have mastered the personal assistant of your dreams!  She looks great, but hey dress her up in a nice stand of your liking and show her off to your friends. They will be amazed!  So far the Echo is the one to beat.  Try it you'll like it.  Prime shipping too!
