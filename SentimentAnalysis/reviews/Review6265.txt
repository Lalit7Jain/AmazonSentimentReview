We have a prime account and this also allows Alexa to play prime music.  We simply say play "Olivia by One Direction", and she starts playing exactly what we asked for.  Additionally we can ask her to play prime music and she will suggest a prime channel and start stream it for us.  The sound is generally pretty good and setting it to the max of 10 is pretty loud.
