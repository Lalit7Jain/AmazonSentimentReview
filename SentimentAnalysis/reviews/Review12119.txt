As for troubleshooting the music library, several very nice Support team members tried to help me get it to upload. I first got a rep who says she’d give me a 30-day trial to verify that it would work before I subscribed. So I spent a couple of days editing my copy of my library (on an extended drive) so I could try dragging them into Amazon’s Music’s desktop app to upload them. But then, the upload from my desktop would not work. Instead I got an email that the trial had already expired -- in two days instead of thirty.
