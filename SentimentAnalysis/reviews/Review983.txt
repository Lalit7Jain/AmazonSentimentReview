Besides music, a great feature is to say "Alexa add eggs to my shopping list"... you name it, she'll add it. With the alexa app on your phone, you always have your shopping list with you. It even records you adding things to your list... so if you have a house full, and you see "ice cream" on your list, or whatever, and want to know who said it - just hit play button, and it will replay the person saying "Alexa add ice cream.."
