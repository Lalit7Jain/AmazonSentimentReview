I was feeling depressed about current events so I said, "Alexa play Martin Luther King." She proceeded to play clip after clip of Dr. King's incredible speeches and I was inspired to get out and take on the day. I've only had my Echo for 24 hrs and I'm already smitten with Alexa. Guess what my parents are getting for Christmas!
