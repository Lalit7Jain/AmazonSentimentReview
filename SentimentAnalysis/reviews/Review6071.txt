Bought this for my husband for Christmas. Big mistake, he is not a tech guy, so we tried to get it to work for him, but if you don't have a smart phone, it is very hard for average person to use. It would not play Merle Haggard for him, nor could country be found. Very frustrating for him and the family, Back it went. Amazon was very speedy in our refund. Thank you for that.
