Home Automation.  I use Wemo switches and Bulbs.  Creating Group names helps immensely.  Over all works well …. But if you have two homes it tends to comingle the devices on one. There’s several weakness, there is no smarts to use the Dimmer on the light bulbs, you can’t ask the status of a switch, are you on or off.  Nor is there an ability to tell Alexis to turn on a light for a specific amount of time.
