I like the Amazon Echo but we don't use it as much as thought we would. If we had any integrated wi-fi devices it would be better. Unfortunately the cost of wi-fi compatible controllers for your thermostat, door locks, lighting, etc. are still too expense to be practical. We need to learn how to use it better. I would like to set it to come on at a certain time with a news update or music to wake by but I don't know if it is possible. It was easy to setup and use and it arrived when promised.
