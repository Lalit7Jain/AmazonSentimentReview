If you are looking for hands-free way of accessing Amazon content (music, deals, shipment info, etc.) and the most basic assistance (math, measurements, weather, etc.) - AND - you are alone or don't mind shushing everyone in the house; then the Echo works. If you are looking for a smart device that can answer questions outside of Amazon's prepared questions/responses, then wait for something better. "I'm sorry, but I can't find the answer to your question" is the most common response I get from Alexa. Using "OK Google" on my phone works for everything I've tried with Alexa that she/it couldn't do. My kids are really frustrated with Alexa's inability to answer questions and I'm tired of being a professional shusher.
