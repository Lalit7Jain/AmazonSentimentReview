Can't say enough great things about my Echo.  Alexa can hear me from across the room and even when I was sick she could distinguish what I was saying.  I have just started using Alexa and it has primarily been for weather and music, but I am looking forward to diving in more with audio books and ordering capabilities to name a few.
