Does everything I expected. But I was essentially looking for a combination of a speaker and something close to Siri. If you're looking for it to handle convoluted questions or carry on full conversations...yeah, not the product for you. But it does everything I want it to do. I love the sound quality and the glowing light. It's very helpful with shopping lists.
