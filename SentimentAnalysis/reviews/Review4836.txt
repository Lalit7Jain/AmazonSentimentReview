Ever since I purchased this 4 months ago, it intermittently fails to respond.  I can see my question on the Alexa app, so I know she hears me.  I can see Alexa's answer on the app, so I know she understands me.  I can see the blue light flicker and wave, as if she were talking back to me, but no sound is coming out.  I've continued to report this issue to Amazon.  "Did you try adjusting the volume?"  Seriously?  We frogged around with resets and now I'm told that the device doesn't work as well on a Wi-fi extender.  Really?  Where was that advertised?  I also own a brand new Echo and Echo Dot.  I've moved them around to see if it's the network or the placement, but neither of those experience the same issues on the same routers when placed in the same spots.  I think the answer is to never buy "Certified Refurbished" anything from Amazon again.  I will update this review if this problem resolves with a factory reset, but I really doubt that's the issue.
