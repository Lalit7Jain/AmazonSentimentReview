This particular Echo was actually a gift.  I love my Echo and Echo Dot, so I got one for my son's family to use.  I think it was a stroke of genius on Amazon's part to open the Echo to outside app developers, so there's always something new to try.  That being said, though, some of the things I use mine for the most are original features.  My favorite is the shopping list; all I need to do is mention an item to Echo as soon as I think of it, and it then shows up on the list on my phone, tablet, and computer when I'm shopping.  I also love its ability to read my Audible books to me when I'm working around the house.  Oh, and the to-do list...and the news update...and the current weather...bottom line, Echo has become a part of my life that I'd really miss, and promptly replace, if it ceased to work.
