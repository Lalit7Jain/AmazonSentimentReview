I've had mine a little over a year & the top has come off in various pieces... I have tried to get them back on - with no luck.  It still works to some extent - but there aren't any controls on the top anymore.  Will try to see in Amazon will stand behind it and fix it or replace it - even though it was purchased over a year ago...  So I had to buy an Echo Dot to replace it.
