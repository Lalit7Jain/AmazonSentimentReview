A more universal feature I'd like to see is speakerphone. It would be great if I could answer an incoming call via Echo and use it as a speakerphone while in my home making dinner or getting ready to go out. The ability to have my texts and e-mails read aloud would be welcome, too. I wouldn't want Alexa to chime in unexpectedly every time I got a text message or e-mail, but being able to say "Alexa, read my newest text message" would be convenient.
