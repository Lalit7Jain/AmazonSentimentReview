The amazon echo is okay in my opinion. First of all the voice recognition is okay but not great. More times then not i find i have to say it two or three times, and when it did hear me a lot of times it heard the wrong thing. Another thing is when your playing anything decently loud you have to scream at it to get its attention. I feel like this takes away from the convenience of being able to tell it what to do. Another thing i find is a little inconvenient is the fact that you basically have to memorize a script because the commands are specific. Meaning in order to do something you have to say the pre set sentences. On the bright side the sound quality is pretty good for a single speaker, but the bass is a little weak. It is easy to connect to your phone for bluetooth, but the bluetooth is really choppy. But if you get amazon unlimited then you can play any song you want through the internet. Also with amazon music you can make playlist then it will play those from the internet.
