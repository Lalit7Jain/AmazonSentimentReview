After initially hesitating buying the Echo, I was really excited when it arrived.  After finding all the fun easter eggs in addition the normal commands we really enjoyed it for the first week.  Then, I started to think I was never going to use it.  We have the Echo in our kitchen and it seemed once the fun wore off I'd regret the purchase.  But I was wrong.  I couldn't live a day without Alexa now.  While I mostly use it for music, having it there has been wonderful.  We don't have it integrated with lights or our thermostat, but it still comes in so handy!
