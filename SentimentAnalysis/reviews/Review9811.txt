I just received my new Echo last week and I absolutely love it! I use it mainly for music due to hosting a lot of get togethers at the house, for news, weather, and commute updates. There are many skills that it has. I enjoy playing Jeopardy and 21 Questions! Asking for recipes or measurement conversions is simple and useful. It works with Android and Apple too! Currently I am enjoying my free trial of Amazon Music Unlimited, but after my trial is over, I don't mind paying for the monthly fee of $3.99/mo for it. My personal opinion is that it is better than Pandora. Yup... I went there. Over all, the technology and ability of this device is amazing.
