Set up was a little "Challenging," it did not work from my iPhone but was flawless on the iPad from the application of the "App Store," when setting up.  I have a OnHub Router will this do the same "magic.!" as the one advertised on the application for working with your TV? If anyone out there knows I'd appreciate a comment! Thanks.
