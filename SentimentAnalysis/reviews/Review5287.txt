Combine the above issue with an accidental command to purchase (ie: News reporting a cute story about how a little girl accidentally purchased a dollhouse and then saying how funny they though it was that "Alexa, ordered me a dollhouse"). In just explaining the story to a friend over Skype I even accidentally triggered their device to try to order a dollhouse! Luckily you can turn ordering off or add a pass code, but caution that this is not the default.
