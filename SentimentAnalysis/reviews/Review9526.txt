One day I played TuneIn Radio and all of the sudden Alexa stopped working, no music was coming out of the Echo.  I didn't think much of it until I went to sleep and around 2 am Alexa turned the TuneIn Radio back on like nothing happen.  Scarred me so much that I had to grab a golf club and go downstairs.  First, I thought I had ghosts so I grabbed my phone and called Ghost Busters.  After a quick prayer, I started yelling at Alexa and told her that she scared me but she didn't understand that so I told her to stop playing music.  I had enough, our relationship was over at that point.  I told her I am returning her but she didn't understand me again (sounds like me ex).
