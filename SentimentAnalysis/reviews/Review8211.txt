I am loving my Echo so far. I am highly entertained by Alexa's witty retorts to my questions like: "Alexa--are you married?" Alexa: " I'm attached....to the wall.:  She could write Obama's bad dad jokes.  Anyway, love the music (speakers work quite well for my purposes) and quick responses to basic questions. She does give me the weather for the next town over, and she can't seem to read my commute even though I've set it up through the app. Otherwise, I have been quite pleased. And when I say, "Alexa, I'm going to bed." And she says, "Good night. Sleep tight." Makes me smile every time.
