Alexa is great for providing local weather updates.  I asked Alexa if she works for the CIA and has said she doesn't understand the question.  I'm hoping she's not passing along any conversations while she's "sleeping."  I talk about my time machine development project and trips to the moon so to entertain Alexa and anyone else that might be listening in Langley, VA <g>.
