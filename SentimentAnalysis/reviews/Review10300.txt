It sounds terrible, changes songs in the middle of the song for no apparent reason and really is nothing more than an expensive way to allow the consumer to buy more junk from Amazon.  I tried to return it but I was beyond their 30 day returns policy so they would only give me some credit to be determined and would not give me an address to the damn thing.  If I am only getting 25 bucks back I will donate it to,Goodwill and let some kid have fun with this.
