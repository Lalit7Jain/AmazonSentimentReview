This device works just the way it should.  I did have to "start it up" with my computer rather than my phone, but once up it has fulfilled all the hype that Amazon gives it.  The sound is adequate for what it is--and I listen to music through my stereo system, not through echo.  It is a great way to get instant weather, find strange conversational tidbits, and other fun things.  I wish you could change the voice to male, but am settling for just using echo as a name rather than Alexis.  I have recommended this product and would definitely buy it again,  I don't know why I waited so long...
