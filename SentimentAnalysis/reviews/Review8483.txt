It's simply unacceptable that I can't use a speaker as a speaker for whatever I want.  If your voice interpretation back-end is worth it's salt as a standalone product, let it compete.  Why can't I play my Apple Music subscription through my phone onto this product?  Or make phone calls through my cell phone?  Not a game Amazon will win long term. Services available through the device are too limited.  This is basically a glorified alarm clock in the meantime.
