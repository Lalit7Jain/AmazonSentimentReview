The echo can be frustrating at times, during the Christmas holiday we listened to "Christmas Blues and a variety of Christian Contemporary", now that the holiday is over it seems the Echo will only pull up "Holiday" music. I will tell Alexa to stop and then re-request and it still brings the holiday music.  Frustrated with it I don't listen to it as much as I would if it brought up my request, I know that the different selections of music are there as I have spent time building my pandora library.
