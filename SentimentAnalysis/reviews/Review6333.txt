I am currently not using this to it's fullest as I don't yet have much in the way of smart home integration. However, for the simple things that I do use it for, it is just OK. I like that it can easily playback music from various music streaming services and making lists can be helpful as well. However, I find that it can rarely answer questions that I have in regards to pretty much anything. It is nearly always quicker for me to search google for an answer to questions that I come up with throughout the day, and if the Echo does actually provide an answer it is generally inadequate, which again leads me to doing a google search on my smartphone. It does many things, but it does few things very well at this point in time.
