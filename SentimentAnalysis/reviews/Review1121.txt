I was given an Amazon Echo for Christmas and I use it all of the time. I like it so much, I bought one as a birthday present for a relative. The voice response is flawless. I can practically whisper and the Echo will pick up my command. My family is also obsessed with "Alexa"! The reason that I rated the Echo at a 4 instead of a 5 is that it takes a bit to set it up. Also, the advertised actions of turning on the lights or even the sprinklers is not that easy. If these things become more readily accessible then I will absolutely give the Echo a full five stars. In terms of volume, the Echo's speaker is great. I placed my device on my refrigerator. Being in an open area allows the 360 degree output to fill all of the adjacent rooms. The audio is also very clear. The height is comparable to that of a paper towel roll (I figure this is an item everyone is familiar with), but a bit less round (in diameter) than a new paper towel roll. Odd analogy, I know, but at least you can put a paper towel roll in a spot and see if the Echo will fit in around the house. The Echo also has a power cord, which isn't made exactly obvious, so keep that in mind. The placement of the Echo is recommended to be away from walls as well, so finding a corresponding outlet may be a bit difficult. The cable is about 5 feet by my eye's judgement. The plug in is not conventional, as it is a rectangular prism and sticks out a bit. The benefit of the plug in is the fact that the cord won't be bent by anything placed in front of an outlet. The plug in also allows enough room to use the upper outlet for a conventional US outlet. Overall, the Echo is a really nice product for a household that often plays music aloud, for those who try to be hands free with their technology, and those willing to upgrade the rest of their electronics to be compatible with the Echo's voice command features.
