Okay :  AMAZING!  Wish I were getting commissions on this product because so far 7 friends and relatives have immediately purchased theirs after seeing mine!  Just installed some TP-LINK light bulbs in two lamps and outdoor post light... LOVE how Alexa turns them on and off on command!  Love setting timers, asking questions, converting figures, playing songs, playing NPR, defining words (NYT crossword help), telling me the time when I can't see a clock, or the weather when not near a window, or temperature (as I do not own a thermometer),and so much more.  Just a FANTASTIC PRODUCT!
