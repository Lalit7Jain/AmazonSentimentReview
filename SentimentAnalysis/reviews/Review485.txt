We have had the Amazon Echo for about a month, now.  I bought it based on the recommendations of a friend.  I was looking for some speakers to play my music on... she asked me if I ever though of the Amazon Echo.  She told me that the speakers were pretty awesome and, coupled with my Amazon Prime account, I could play all my music and more.  She was right.  My family loves our new music machine.
