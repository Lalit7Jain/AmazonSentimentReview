I ordered the Echo as a solution to wanting a Bluetooth speaker.  With the cost of decent speakers, I figured getting something like Echo was a smarter choice.  So far, I like it, but like others have noted, there's been connectivity issues.  It's pretty convenient to have.  It can't control much in my house since it's old, but I'm sure smart homes can get more bang for their buck with this.  The sound quality isn't too shabby.
