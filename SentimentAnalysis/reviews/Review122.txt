I like Alexa, but she is limited in her ability to understand questions.  We have tried various ways to ask things, and she just doesn't get it.  Then we ask Siri on our phone, and get the answer right away.  She is great for daily news updates and playing music, and we will eventually set it up to control some appliances, which should bring more value.
