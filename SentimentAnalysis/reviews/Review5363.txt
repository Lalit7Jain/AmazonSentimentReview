So far so good, got it on New Years of 2017 so have not set everything up yet, just the basics and it works pretty well for now. I will rewrite a review in about 30-60 days to give a more detailed pros and cons list. Just to say one thing so far, the set up to Wifi and such was very easy and simple and the speaker for music is pretty good, but with very little bass.
