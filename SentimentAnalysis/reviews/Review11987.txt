If I have one complaint it is that the hub of the house is the kitchen, the best use for me is in the kitchen.  Although it is a tower and doesn't take up that much space, every bit of counter space is valuable and in my kitchen all counters are possible danger zones.  I am waiting for Alexa to get smashed or saturated and keep trying to find her a safe spot.  I wish this could mount to a wall or hang from underneath cabinet.
