Would you like a math problem getting solved fast? Are you going to turn on and off the lights everyday? If you do then you need to buy Alexa from the Amazon. Alexa could turn your lights on or off. It could even turn your car on! Alexa can tell you the weather outside. She might even be able to tell you a joke. Alexa is smarter than Siri. I know because Alexa knows Siri and Siri does not know Alexa. Alexa can also play music or read you a story! If you did not buy Alexa today then buy it tomorrow. I give it five stars out of five.
