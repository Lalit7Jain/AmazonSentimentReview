Apart from the finicky voice interface, my Echo unit has had numerous connectivity issues. Music stutters, randomly skips tracks, Alexa says she is having problems, or it just spontaneously stops altogether. It's not my bandwidth or home network. I have two phones, Firesticks, iPad, Kindle, and PC all connected wirelessly and none are experiencing problems. My Ookla speedtest shows good results. I've performed several Gateway resets and a "hard" reset. Finally, after the last one, Echo seems to be working decently, but now I'm wondering if I'll have to go through the clunky wifi setup process with Echo every day. This is supposed to be a device that is "always" on.
