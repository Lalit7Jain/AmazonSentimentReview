So far the Echo is working fairly well.  After almost a month, I'm still discovering what I can do with it.  I love the Shopping and To Do lists, although I wish I could create multiple lists in each category.  I understand I can add such a skill, but I don't want to use an additional app on my phone for that. My biggest complain about the Echo is that it doesn't seem to understand natural language very well. Whenever I ask her a questions for which the answers could easily be found in any search engine, she comes back with something to the effect that "I did not understand your question."  Maybe it's the way I'm asking it.  I have added a few skills (e.g., Fitbit, Bloomberg, NPR, etc.). The skills works well.
