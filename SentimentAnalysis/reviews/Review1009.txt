I've decided to chuck both the smart switch and Alexa, both require too much and return too little.  One shouldn't have to have a handful of devices to make Alexa smart enough to do its duty (I refuse to humanize a barely functional machine).  I bought them to comfort my wife in hospice by playing music and reading her Kindle books, but she's gone now and the machine was no help at all - due to the ridiculous, designed in constraints that refused to even read a bought and paid for book from Amazon or turn a light on and off without first having a smart phone or the proper Android OS.
