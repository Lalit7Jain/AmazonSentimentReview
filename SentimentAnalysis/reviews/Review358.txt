Have heard and read great things about Echo so was excited when it arrived. Unfortunately, I was unable to connect the Echo to my home wifi network. Called the Amazon help line and they were unable to provide any logical direction -- told me to call Comcast (my internet provider) but were unable to give me any details about what I was supposed to ask them to do. Very disappointed! Echo is going back to Amazon tomorrow.
