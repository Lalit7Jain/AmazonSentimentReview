Awesome toy and tool. Amazing sound from this little "thing" -- I've had my moments asking for specific songs from my past and HELLO!- I literally jump up and dance. I'm still learning and I'm sure there are some things I won't use Alexa for, such as ordering a pizza (well, maybe I will). I had some difficulty connecting some lights/outlets -- it would be awesome if Alexa could assist with that :). But this is the best thing: I can drive my cat crazy!!! My cat has the habit of cruizing the house in the middle of the night howling at the top of his voice, waking me up. Now I ask Alexa to meow-meow and she does with awesome variety! And my cat comes running and shuts up!
