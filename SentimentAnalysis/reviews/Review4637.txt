Great product - came in great shape & very quickly. The only reason for 4 stars is because it really wasn't all we expected. Really wish it went off google instead of bing search (and trust me, you can definitely tell the difference). You also have to download a ton of apps to get Alexa to answer really any questions. In all honesty, Siri is quicker & better at answering questions. Not sure it's worth the money, but she seems to be getting smarter over time and with the download of more apps.
