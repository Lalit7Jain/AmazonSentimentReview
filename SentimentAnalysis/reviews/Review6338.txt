I love Alexa but she does have some limitations.  I find slight phrasing can make a big difference in her understanding.  I find myself at times wishing she had Cortana's personality and Ok googles deeply interconnected intelligence. Both Cortana ond Ok google offer a more knowing and intelligent AI.  Although they do read your email and track your location to do that.
