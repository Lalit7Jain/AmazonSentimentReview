Bought this item about a year ago and have become WAY less enchanted with Alexa.  Actually she is DUMBER than a stick.  90 percent of the questions we ask are met with "I'm sorry I am unable to answer your question"  Bla Bla bla.  We really rely on OK Google via phone to get quick answers to any question within seconds.  Absolute waste of money !!!!
