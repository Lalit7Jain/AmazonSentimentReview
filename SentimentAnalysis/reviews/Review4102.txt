If you just want sound to fill a room, then Echo is great. It certainly would not satisfy an audiophile but it does the job nicely and my wife is very happy (!).  You can always attach (wire or Bluetooth) a speaker, but really if you are just looking for background music, the Echo by itself is good enough. My Echo sits on a ledge between the kitchen and living room and easily puts out enough sound at Level 5 to cover 1000 sqft in our open ground floor. I will say that the volume control (which can be voice controlled or manually) is not very linear.  Below level 4 the sound drops off very sharply so Level 4 or above is needed for better sound quality. Still if you buy a Dot, an Anker portable speaker (very good ratings) and USB charger, it will cost about $110 compared to a $199 Sonos Play1 which has to have a tablet or smartphone to drive it and doesn’t do anything but play music.  The Dot/Speaker combination is a winning combination for me because it can do so much more.
