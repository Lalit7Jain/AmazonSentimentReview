I purchased it on Amazon thinking it would be cool for my condo. Being a jazz lover and modern contemporary type I thought it would sit great on table in living room. The problem is the damn thing never works. I have two different wifi networks and it can never connect! When she plays music it is always cutting out! It has become very frustrating, I would have done better buying a 25 dollars Bluetooth speaker to do what this $179 piece of crap is doing.. do not buy this product you will be very unhappy with it, not worth the hype!
