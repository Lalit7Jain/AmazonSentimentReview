Voice recognition is average at best. Speaker is fairly good. Where Alexa lost me, and "Alexa" being the inalterable activation word is stupid, is ordering through Amazon. For example, I tried to re-order Goji berries - which I've ordered on Amazon a dozen times - Alexa said, "Based on your order history, I found..." and it wasn't what I ordered. Instead it was a much more expensive option I only discovered after it was delivered. This happened with MULTIPLE items.
