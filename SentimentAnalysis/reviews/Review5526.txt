We really wanted to like Echo but Alexa got 50% of the questions wrong or didn't know the answer. These were fairly simple questions like who's on the front of the US dollar bill? It didn't know what whales eat. It didn't know the current minority leader of the senate. As soon as I asked the same question using the Google app on my iPad, it got every question right. Unfortunately I found using Alexa disappointing and a big fail. Alexa is going back in the box and hopefully back to school. I'm going to be trying Google Home and see if it's as smart as the Google App on my iPad.
