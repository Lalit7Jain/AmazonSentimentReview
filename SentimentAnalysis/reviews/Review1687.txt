Had a lot of fun with this but after 2 years it has suddenly started coming on without prompting and no matter all the solutions I was given did not fix it. I now have it unplugged. I have written the company but basically got the ole song and dance "hey we are constantly looking to upgrade." Thanks for your information dummy...You didn't really think we were going to help you, did you?
