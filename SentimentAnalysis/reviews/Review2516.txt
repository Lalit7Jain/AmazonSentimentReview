Received Echo a week ago as a birthday present. You will need a minimum full day of time to set it up if you are lucky.  Major problem is the Echo turns itself off and then you need to start from the beginning with the install application.  I still do not have my Echo working and it has been a full day.  If this was not a gift, I would return it to Amazon.  My Siri does just fine when I need or want anything she can provide.  Okay, back to the bad news of getting Echo to work properly.  Amazon has major glitches it needs to attend to with the Echo.
