I can't comment on the many features... as we use this almost exclusively for music... Literally, wake up and say "Alexa play some music"... then "Alexa off"... get home and it's the same "Alexa play some music"... we love music, and Alexa sounds great. Easily adjust volume by turning dial on top of unit... or by having Alexa do it via verbal instruction... "Alexa volume up" or "Alexa volume 8".
