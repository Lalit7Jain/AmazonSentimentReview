I am trying to like you, Alexa, but you just won't let me! You worked fine for two months and now you won't connect to WIFI no matter what we try! Our relationship was short-lived. I enjoyed our musical mornings as I got ready for work. You gave me accurate weather conditions so I could dress appropriately. But now, your magic blue light doesn't show for me anymore. I suspect that you might be two-timing me with the neighbor's WIFI, but I can't tell. So long, Alexa; I am sending you back to Amazon.
