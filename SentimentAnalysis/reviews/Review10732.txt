I ordered an Echo not knowing my boyfriend had sent me one as a surprise.  I returned the one I ordered.  Wish I had actually returned both.  There’s really not much else on the market right now that can compete with the outdated voice recognition technology this device has.  It’s decent only because there’s nothing else out there. Congrats, Amazon!  You’re only not super terrible because there’s no one else terribler than you at the moment.
