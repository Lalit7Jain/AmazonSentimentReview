What I can say that hasn't been said.  This product has changed the way that I operate my household.  I initially bought this to control my Harmony Companion remote & hub.  But then Nexia which powers my smart home hub introduced a Nexia smart home skill for Amazon Echo.  Boy did that ever change the game for me.  Now I tell Alexa to turn on the tv when I want to watch tv or I tell her to turn a movie when I want to watch a movie.  When it's time for bedtime I tell her to turn off the tv and then I tell her to turn on bedtime, which is one my Nexia scenes/automation.  When I tell her that the lights in the front of the house turn off and the master bedroom/bathroom lights come on.  If I want to turn on/off a light at any point during the time and I'm not near the light switch I let Alexa do it for me.
