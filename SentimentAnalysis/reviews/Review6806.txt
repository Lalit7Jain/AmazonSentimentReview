I love the ability to listen to what ever song is in my head by just talking to Alexa.  It's much quicker than typing and searching in Spotify.  I can ask it to reliably shuffle play my playlists.  Works seemlessly with Wemo smart plug.  Very impressed with its ability to understand me and my family.  My anti-tech wife was so impressed she asked me to buy 2 more to give away as gifts.
