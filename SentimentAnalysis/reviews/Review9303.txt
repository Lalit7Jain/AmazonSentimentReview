Despite working well with myriad 3rd party applications and devices, Amazon has still not integrated any of their own devices. It's completely unacceptable that my Echo cannot interact with my FireTV or Echo dot. It's a broken ecosystem that is going to get trounced by Google Home if they can't fix search and they don't integrate with their own devices. I can play something on a significantly less powerful chromecast from google home with no issues. It's basic functionality.
