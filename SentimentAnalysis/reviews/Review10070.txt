This is one of the most intuitive items I have used in a long wile. The voice UI is close to spot-on, for me better than Siri and Okay Google on my smartphones. I can even give a command from about >20 feet away in the other room. Although it seems to struggle with the volume up above six (6) hearing me from farther away making it hard to turn down the volume from the other room. I would have not only given this five stars but I would have purchased several more if they would connect giving me music throughout the home/patio. This one device playing at a time just seems like a waste of good technology.
