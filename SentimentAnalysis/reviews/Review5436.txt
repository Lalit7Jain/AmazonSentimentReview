This is a great product! I got this for our family a year ago for xmas! Since the whole having an A.I in your home is a big thing now, I decided to give it a try. So I will say this, its great for what you want to use it for, but dont expect it to be like J.A.R.V.I.S from Tony Stark/Iron Man. Alexa can pretty much hear and pick up your voice form anywhere (where have ours in the kitchen) thank to the omini-directional listening it has. It plays amazon music very well and also has amazing volume and bass. Its really good at finding list you request from pandora also. As far as questions goes, if the question makes sense and she can search for it, she will find an answer, however ive noticed she struggles with current conversation questions like you would ask a buddy or something. An example : "Alexa who do you think will win the SuperBowl"? She will basically just say "I cannot find the answer you are looking for". Trust me, there a lot of questions you will ask that she cant answer. Yet, once again if questions make sense, especially in the educational sense, she will find an answer definitely. You can also joke with her a bit, its fun to see her answers for those.
