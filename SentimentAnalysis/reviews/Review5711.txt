Needs more general question programming and doesn't place regular amazon orders just rush orders.  ALSO have issues when Amazon is OUT OF STOCK, it says things that are not related to the phrase "sorry, this item is out of stock".  One time I was ordering an item OUT OF STOCK but it told me there was a problem with my payment method.  I spent about 3 hours trying to figure out what was wrong with my payment method.  Called tech support, they spent about an hour on the issue and couldn't figure it out until they had me place a fake order to see if the payment method was ok and it was.  Then tried to order the same item as the original order via the website and it told me the item was OUT OF STOCK.  Only then did we figure that Alexa's response was WRONG!  Very frustrated with the lack of OUT OF STOCK phrase not seemingly programmed into the Alexa program.  Great speaker though for music!
