Seems to work well with occasional glitches.  Great at listening to music and turning on and off my lights (after setup).  Price point is about right and the quality of Echo build is good.  This review would be 4 stars overall but due to Alexa's political rants and slant about the US presidential election - one star.  Amazon- Please keep politics out of your products!! :(.  When I ask for the news I don't want to hear a sore loser's rant or opinions....I want to to hear news.
