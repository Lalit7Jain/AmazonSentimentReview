I love the Echo but being an older person and not use to all the tech realities, I wish more info was put out in it's selling details explaining you would need a smart phone or a computer headed nephew that could get it going for you.In my opinion,a nice product but not user friendly for most of us older folks. Also the yearly discount they offered at approximately $3.99 a month could not be applied for some reason. I had to go with the yearly fee of $99.99.To me this was a bit of false advertising
