I can't believe that this won't work as a speakerphone for my iPhone. Great speaker. World class microphone. Seem's like a no-brainer, but nope, it doesn't conect to your iPhone for speakerphone use. I use it to listen to audiobooks while cooking, and to listen to new briefs, but once the novelty wears off it's missing a ton of practical features. Sure you can go crazy programming IFF features, but who has time for that?
