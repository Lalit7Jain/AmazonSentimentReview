One thing about this if you plan on using it with a Prime account for music. Since they started the music unlimited service you can only get selected songs on prime now. It seems that the more popular songs, like Katy Perrys I kissed a Girl, is not on prime, instead you get a sample about 20 seconds long. And when you complain to Amazon all you get is more BS about the two separate services and how to use them. Nothing about the fact they're charging you for something you should already be getting with prime and how this is just another way to gouge you.
