This might be the begining of skynet but it is a really  great smart device except that they use the worst search engine ever, Bing! What kind of backward fuckeries is that, Bing?  Your children will also be talking to Alexa all day if you don't pay them enough attention & do you really want your kids talking to a smart device that is limited to Bing for information, seriously, not very smart?
