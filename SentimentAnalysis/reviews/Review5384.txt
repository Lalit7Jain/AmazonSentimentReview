The Alexa service is great but I'm rating the Echo here.  Setting up the Echo is the most frustrating experience I've had in 25 years of IT.  I have 2 Echo's and 2 Echo Dot's.  The Echo Dot is not as bad probably because its the latest Echo with a newer radio or better antenna.  For both Echo's it took about a half hour of starting, stopping, resetting, rebooting, unplugging and starting all over again.  I finally got it to pair with my router when it was literally inches away from it even through I had a full strength WiFi signal on my phone.  After pairing the device with my WiFi network I moved the device to a location I actually want to use it and it can't reach the WiFi network, this time about 20 feet from the hub which has 2.5ghz and 5ghz radios and supports Wireless A, G, N and AC.
