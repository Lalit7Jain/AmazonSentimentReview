I love Alexa, which I speak to everyday. I say "Good morning" and says it back with information of a historical face. She'll give me the weather in any city and state I ask. She plays 20 questions. I love that all I have to say is "Pandora" and she'll play where it left off. She keeps 'To Do Lists" and she tells me what deals are on Amazon. She's everything I wanted and more.
