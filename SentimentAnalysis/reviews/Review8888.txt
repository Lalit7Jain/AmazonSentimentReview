Third, I setup this device using the Alexa app on my phone and on my iPhone 6 it's god-awful slow. It's so slow I had to start the setup three times to get it connected to my wireless network. The Echo and Dot both stopped setup before I could finish the setup on the phone on my app. I tried setting up Bluetooth speakers on my Dot and had to use the Alexa page on Amazon's site to get the Dot to recognize the speakers, once the Dot was setup on the network. The App stalled and wouldn't recognize them and voice commands to the Dot told me it didn't recognize any devices using Bluetooth. On the Alexa Amazon website, it saw the Bluetooth speakers and paired the Echo with it in less than 5 seconds. The Alexa phone app is essentially nonfunctional so I removed it from my phone once I set the Echo and Dot devices up.
