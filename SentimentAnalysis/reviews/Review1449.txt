I wish I could give it zero stars.  I bought one and it wouldn't setup.  I spent hours on the phone with tech support and it still wouldn't setup.  They said they would call me back with more information within 72 hours.  They never called.  I called again and spent a few more hours with tech support and they finally realized it was broken and issued me a tag to send it back.  They also shipped me a replacement echo.  Guess what?  Same thing.  I tried to set it up, and it failed miserably.  I tried several times and failed each time. I called tech support again and spent another couple hours and it still wouldn't work, so they said they would escalate it to a developer level trouble ticket and call me back in 4-5 days.  Well, guess what?  They never called.  I got sick of it so I got a tag and sent it back.  I got my refund today, and amazon had the balls to deduct $24 as a restocking fee refund deduction.  Great!  A restocking fee for something that never worked and for which amazon never called me back.  So I got to spend more time on the phone with customer service and I was initially told I was going to get $14 of the $24 back, and I was pretty blunt that paying a restocking fee for something that is broken is a bunch of crap.  Finally got my $24 back.
