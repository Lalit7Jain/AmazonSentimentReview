This product cannot even get Bluetooth speaker right. With my phone right beside it it will play music for about 5 minutes before it starts wavering and the music sounds like it's coming in and out. My $30 Bluetooth speaker does a better job. This product has been relegated to a toy for my nieces to play with as they don't really have an expectation and are plenty pleased when they get a response the %40 of the time that Echo understands and responds (Jeopardy is their favorite) .The idea was wonderful and maybe in the future a better product will be made, but after giving it more than it's fair chances I felt I had to share my experiences.
