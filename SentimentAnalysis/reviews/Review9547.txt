This is the coolest thing ever!  Even if it cost $500, it would be worth it.  It does everything you can think of, and if you look into it a little, you'll find that it can do a whole lot of things you can't even think of.  Looking at a cell phone or computer screen is the old way.  Now you just say, "Alexa, Weather."  It gives you the rundown on the weather.  Hear a new word and want a definition, ask Alexa what it means.  I hear this device can read a book to you.  Want news headlines?  Just ask.  It's a great speaker that you can use over Bluetooth.  I tell it a radio station using the iHeart Radio skill, and it starts playing my favorite shows.  Want to buy something, there is a way to order by voice using this device.  Or you can turn off that feature if you don't want to use it to buy things, then there are no accidents.  It has very sensitive microphones that can hear you over things already playing.  It's very intelligent.  I thought Siri was cool, but this thing is leaps and bounds better.  This takes a personal assistant to a whole other level.  I could go on and on, but just buy one and see for yourself.
