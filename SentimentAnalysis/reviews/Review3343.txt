How can you not love this product? Put it beside our hot tub. A few candles, any music you could ask for, its heaven. OK, admittedly though, Alexa is not very bright compared to Siri. She cannot process multiple commands even simple ones like "Play 1990's Rock and Roll at Sound Level 4", and, even harder to believe, YOU CAN'T GET A WAKE UP ALARM TO MUSIC. Gee, that is just plain dumb. Hope they fix that.
