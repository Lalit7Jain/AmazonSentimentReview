Very pleased with this purchase as a Christmas present. Works as well as one could hope for. Learning new uses regularly. Surprised how much we still use the echo (was worried it would just be a novelty). Located in the kitchen and is used regularly. Does a great job of understanding your commands even from a distance. Although sound quality is pretty good for what it is, would like a new model available with higher end music audio quality.
