We're in love....she does it all, my favorite songs, my grocery list, to do list, whats on my calendar, what the news is, reads me my books and daily bible reading, wakes me up and plays lullabies when we're in bed, wakes me up with a really nice sound and times my cookies.  There are no words to our joy.....
