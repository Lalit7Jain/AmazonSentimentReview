This echo needs wifi to work and needs to be plugged in at all times. It may also connect to a phone through bluetooth for general audio but the true features come through syncing your devices' apps to the echo through wifi. AleXA sets my alarms and is a good listener. I don't have wifi outlets yet to use her to turn my home appliances and lights on or off but I might buy some once the technology gets better for those plugs. I'm happy with alexa and she can be very hilarious to chat with aND ask questions to.  Sometimes I have to yell at her to be quiet cuz no one was talking to her and she's giving random history facts but that only happened one really convenient (funny) time in a conversation with my husband.
