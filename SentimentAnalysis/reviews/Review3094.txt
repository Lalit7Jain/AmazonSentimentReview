Pretty cool addition to my electronic arsenal. The only drawback is that I am in France on an assignment and so if I ask about the weather she gives me the weather for my US mailing address. A little annoying as I have to say "Alexa what is the weather in Marseille France" (where I live). Other than that Alexa is a pretty cool gal and she hears me from pretty much wherever I am within range. Amazon did a good job with this and I would recommend it.
