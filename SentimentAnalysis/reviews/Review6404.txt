We really liked this - bought it early on and used it primarily for music, audiobooks, morning news and had just started into new tasks such as ordering pizze and uber.  Unfortunately, it just died shortly after the one-year warranty period ended. That's a shame because we've been exploring wifi speaker systems and we'd like that system to link to our home AI device. I really like the Sonos and Denon systems, but frankly, this bad experience is making me look harder at google home integrations.
