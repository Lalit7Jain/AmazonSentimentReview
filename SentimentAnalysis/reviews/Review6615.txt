I am not a happy camper. I bought this device because I wanted to surround myself with music. Friends told me all I needed to do was verbally request Echo play an artist, genre, or song. I already had Prime music, Amazon digital music purchases, and I upgraded to the $3.99 a month Amazon music unlimited. I also have Pandora. Unfortunately, although it is Dec 30, when I request an artist it defaults to Christmas music by the artist, or other religious music they've recorded. I can skip a song, but not an album. Sometimes after requesting an artist, after a song or two it defaults to unrelated Christmas music. Earlier today when I asked it to stop it wouldn't, and I had to unplug the device to stop the Christmas music. I feel like I'm being attacked. Isn't this device supposed to learn my preferences? How many dozens of times will I need to skip Christmas music before it stops defaulting to it?  I contacted Amazon and was told I need to request specific songs or albums by the artist. If I have to look up this info on my phone or laptop to request music, Echo is not a convenience. I should have just stuck to my bluetooth phone charger music player.  The US is known for it's religious freedom and diversity. Why is Christian religious music a default? Amazon, on what date will we be past Christmas?
