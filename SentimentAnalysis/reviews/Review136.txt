I've had the unit 8 months and I've grown a hate for it.  Mainly because it never seems to understand what I want.  I order double A batteries and end up with triple A.  I as if I need a coat and it rymes off what the weather will be like later.  Ask it to order obit fun it asks me if I want to buy a audio book.  It's such a crap voice recognition.  Everyone laughs that I have such a hard time.  I've ran speech sessions and it's zero improvement.  It's in the quietest part of the living room.
