Dumber than I expected.  No daylight savings time - it knows when it is, but didn't adjust its clock.  To many skills that need to be added to make it knowledgeable.  Even when skills are added you have to remember the skills name so you can ask alexa to the ask the skill for the answer.  Very disappointing.  No one is capable of remembering all of the various skills' names to know which one to ask alexa to task.
