It is the best gift ever, so easy to setup and I get the news, play my music, get the weather.  Have not found too many things it can't do yet.  I am sure I will be expanding my use of it the longer I have it.  Two other family members received one this year for Christmas.  You got to get one, you won't we sorry..
