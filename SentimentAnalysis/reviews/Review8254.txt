2. Secondly, you cannot get Alexa to repeat an entire album. Call me old school, but I am not into randomly shuffled singles. I like listening to an entire album, in the exact order that it was produced by the artist. The most talented artists will guide you on a unique emotional journey using the sequence and song transitions of their albums. Echo ruins this journey. I'd call it antagonistically anti-album in general. Tell Echo to "repeat the album 'Dark Side of the Moon'," and she says I'll repeat this song. Then, you get only the first song on the album over and over. Echo music playback is obviously focused on singles and randomly constructed playlists. Echo also messes up albums which have interstitial music or sound between tracks. Instead of playing the album as it was recorded, Echo puts artificial pauses between every song, chopping up any transitional audio between tracks. Albums like Dark Side of the Moon, Crime of the Century, or Rhythm Nation are simply butchered by this approach. I find it extremely annoying, at best.
