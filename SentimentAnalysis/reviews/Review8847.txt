I bought a certified refurbished Echo, and have been completely satisfied with this purchase.  It was packaged professionally in the original boxing and once I plugged it in and set it up, it worked flawlessly.  I never knew how much I would come to depend on this little gadget.  She's incredibly useful for a number of tasks (as I'm sure you're likely aware from the numerous YouTube videos), and she's great for music and entertainment.  My next steps are to purchase some smart products to fully utilize her smart home integration features.  Can't wait to see how it all works out.  Thank you Amazon!
