AM a little disappointed with this , want to love but its uses are limited, I drops wifi signals sometimes and works with my automated lighting when it wants to,  the only uses to me are weather, tell me some jokes, can't see all the positive reviews, I guess  just a lot of lonely folks out there. Just not worth 179.00 just an over hyped gadget in my honest opinion!!
