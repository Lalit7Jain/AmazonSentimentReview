Recently I got 100mps internet from Spectrum. Echo lost its wifi connection in the process. What I had to go thru in trying to reconnect the device to my wifi is unacceptable. It shows that Amazon is clearly not an Apple or even Samsung when it comes to knowing their customers and making things easy. On the contrary, the process of reconnecting shows that Amazon has listened to well-worn computer 'experts' without listening to its customers. After all, we are not all computer professionals, and we don't repeat the same steps for problems on a regular basis, like pros do. If I could I would return the Echo, even though I like it very much when it's working. For $200 they should include easy set-up, as in most tablets and laptops nowadays.
