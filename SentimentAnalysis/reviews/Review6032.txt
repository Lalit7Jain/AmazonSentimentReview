It hasn't wowed me yet. It Can do almost everything my smartphone can.  I have concected a smort home or a smart car to it so I havent seen its full potential but once I do, then I will be able to write a more in depth review. For now it does the functions that i purchased it for ; music, simple questions. Wish it made calls.
