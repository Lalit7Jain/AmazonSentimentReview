The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because the echo dots are a fraction of the price and do exactly the same thing the only difference is that they don't have the 360 degrees speakers ... But you can hook your own speaker to the dots ... I know is not right since the dots came out earlier but since they are cheaper the dots are getting the 5 stars
