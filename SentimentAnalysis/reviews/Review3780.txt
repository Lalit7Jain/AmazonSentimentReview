This I bought for ME.....Wow is all I can say!  I use it mainly for music and Alexa has learned my type of music now and I just have her play her choices and I am never disappointed.  I am not real savvy when it comes to Electronics, so I don't get all the uses out of it that I could.  The music is good enough for me!  I carry it from room to room to listen, probably need the little echo!
