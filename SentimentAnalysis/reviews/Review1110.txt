Its a fad. If you have a spare phone you will get the same capabilities as this echo. Alexa can't answer a lot of the types of questions i ask, but it does decent job of playing music on demand. Sound quality is good for a small room, however i wish it had audio out. I have older HIFI system so it doesn't support the bluetooth audio from the Echo. "Note: Echo feature: Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) support for audio streaming to Bluetooth speakers from Amazon Echo" A little expensive for what you get. A better deal is the Echo Dot which does come with an audio out port.And it'll save over $100.
