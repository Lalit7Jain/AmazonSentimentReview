It has been a great addition to my daily routine. I ask Alexa a lot of questions. She does have a good answer base, but I find that she only has one variation of one-off questions. Ex: if you ask for a funny pick up line she uses the same one over and over. Not a deal breaker whatsoever, but if people are use to Siri having a larger variety of answers to the same questions you won't find it here. The flash briefing feature is nice, and the commute feature is really cool. The speaker is wonderful and the selection of music is perfect.
