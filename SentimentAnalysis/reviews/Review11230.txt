Love Alexa.  I own several Dots and 2 Echos.  We love of them.  My biggest complaint is Amazon punishes early adopters.  I just bought a second Echo two weeks ago and this weekend the price dropped $40.  The original 2 Dots I bought were double the price I paid last month for 3 more.  I'm not feeling the love here Amazon.
