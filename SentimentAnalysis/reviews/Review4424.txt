Great sound, great product. but i wish it did more... Limited podcast selection,  Free Audio books from prime not accessible straight from echo, have to use phone/tablet and connect it via Bluetooth.  it will play audio books you own however... But really think it should have open access to podcast and audio books... Maybe I'm just missing something here. Would like to be hands off the whole time, and not need my tablet around for things.
