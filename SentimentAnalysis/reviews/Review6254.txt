Update: After a little over a month, I'd say the Echo is still not bad (3-3.5 stars).  It won't blow your socks off or anything, but it does have some useful features.  The price does need to come down, but it's still a relatively new product.  Economies/scale and customer demand will eventually drive price to something more reasonable.  I'm toying with getting some lights, to get the benefits of voice control of my smart appliances.  For $20-50 per smart bulb versus <$5 per dumb bulb, it's a tough sell.  As cool as it would be to voice control my lights, I can flick a switch just as easily.  Also, it just doesn't work well with Logitech Harmony (for me anyway).  Even when it does manage to turn on the TV, it's still easier and quicker to grab my phone or remote to control the devices. I think I would've preferred the DOT, as I can hook it into my sound system.  However, it may be better to wait for something with optical audio out from Amazon, Google, or Microsoft.  I use it for the Alarm, Music, and occasional Google Calendar appointment.  I tried to get into the habit of using the timer during cooking, but end up using the stove timer more often.  Just set in my ways.
