Alexa is always listening. If anyone says her name (TV commercial, Radio, a friend on Discord, TWITCH) she will respond. Being able to customize her name to Echo or Amazon instead doesn't fix the issue either. Having a custom name so that she really becomes "my" household device would really alleviate this. I do understand there are issues with people creating their own custom names, but even Alexa sometimes doesn't hear her name correctly and she will randomly jump into conversations picking up on phrases we can't quite figure out.
