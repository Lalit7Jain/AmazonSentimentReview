It's super nice to ask and get the weather, play games, listen to music, get some headlines, stuff like that. I haven't tried the order part yet, because I like to see a picture of the thing I am buying to verify it's what I want. Alexa is not so good at searching to find an answer, when I ask questions like "How many times have the New England Patriots football team have gone to the Super bowl? For questions like this, I get "I don't know the answer". If I use the wikipedia command, she starts reading the page. I have to prompt her to read more. It can take a while to get my answer. I would like Alexa to search to find the answer when I ask it the first time, versus read the first sentence of a wikipedia page, then ask if I want her to read more. So, the search technology from spoken language needs to get a lot better, and I am sure they are working on it. Otherwise, it's fun to play around with and offer's lots of games, and interfaces to other appliances.
