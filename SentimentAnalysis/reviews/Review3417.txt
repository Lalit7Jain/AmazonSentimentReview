This was the one Christmas present I was most looking forward to but I was so disappointed.  Everything we asked she responded "I can't find the answer to your question" unless it was the weather.  When I looked in the app the question was listed just like I asked it so it was understanding me, just not finding answers or responding.  I called customer service and they were of no help.  I told them I asked "when does Ohio state boys basketball play again" with the same "I don't understand the question" response.
