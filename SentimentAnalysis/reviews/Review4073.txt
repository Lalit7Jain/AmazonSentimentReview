Love the ease of set up and how it works for news, sports and weather. However, I had to deduct a star, as I have not been enjoying the music. It is great requesting anything you want from Amazon Music without picking up your phone, but there is very little base, and sounds very tinny. I will use the Echo for convenience, but will be going back to my MEGABOOM and Sonos when wanting real sound quality.
