This product is hands down one of our best purchases yet.  The Alexa has outdone our expectations.  She arms our alarm, she turns on and off our lights, she tells us jokes, plays us music, answers our questions, and even tells us stories (of course she has endless possibilities though)  we even had a moment where our at the time 7 year old daughter asked her "Alexa where do babies come from?"  At that very moment we froze...... but we gave her a chance to answer before we told her to stop.  Alexa answered with "I think that is a question you should ask your parents"  just like that we fell in love that much more.  Kids will be kids, and Alexa with be oh Alexa.  We are so happy with this purchase, and we are looking at getting a dot for our kids rooms to keep the fun going.  Thank you for an amazing product.
