The one thing that I find undesirable--in fact, quite creepy--is that it "listens" to sounds in its environment.  (Note the recent request made to Amazon to provide information that could be helpful in a murder investigation.  The Echo was in the room during the murder and presumably recorded sounds that might be clues.  This was reported in the Washington Post shortly after Christmas 2016.)
