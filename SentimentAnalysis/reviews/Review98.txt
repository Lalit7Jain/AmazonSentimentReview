Alexa doesn't know about a bird named an oriole, only the team. It can't tell me in what play Mark Ruffalo is currently starring. Or who is the king of the Greek gods. Or a ship named Ironsides. Or the captain of Moby Dick. Or, asked about Jane Eyre, it responds "the character in Jane Eyre." And so on and on...and on. I thought if I held back from being an early adopter, the knowledge base would be a little more robust. It is most assuredly not robust.
