We've been using Alexa for couple of days now and I am underwhelmed by how little Alexa "knows" and understands. The hilarity of incorrect responses wears off pretty quickly and gets replaced by frustration over the money spent on a rather dumb Bluetooth speaker. We even took the time to train Alexa to our voices but it didn't make much of a difference. After all that hype in the media it seemed like Amazon has cracked the code. Instead, Alexa is like Apple's Siri, just worse!
