This beautiful lady joined us earlier this week and we have had nothing but fun with her.  Well,  there was the time I wanted to see how loud she could sing and she got so loud she couldn't hear me telling her to lower it.  But all in all its been great ! She needed an outfit so I ordered this silky red number.  Her size?  Don't ask,  that is just rude . A wine bottle outfit fits her perfectly.  ~Elaine
