It would prove to be more useful if it didn't have to be plugged into an outlet.  I guess I was expecting something that was rechargeable.  I was disappointed that it wasn't.  It didn't come with much of nothing for instructions.  Any and everything you choose to do on it has to be tied to amazon.  So I am not so happy with the product.  I am just to lazy to send it back.  My granddaughter stated she will make use of it.  It needs improvement.
