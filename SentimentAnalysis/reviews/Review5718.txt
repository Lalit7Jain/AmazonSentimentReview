I am seriously considering returning this thing. Amazon seem to be floundering around with these Alexa devices and can't decide which features to include or exclude. None of the three - Echo, Dot or Tap is quite all there. They need to combine the best features into ONE DEVICE and quit all the nonsense. The Echo can play music but it has no stereo output of any kind. I assumed it would connect to bluetooth speakers since the onboard speakers are so horrible for playing music (irritating distorted bass and no stereo). WRONG! The Tap at least has stereo speakers, but no voice control (which begs the question, "what is the point?". The Dot will connect to external speakers via bluetooth or cable but is so small it basically requires external speakers to have decent sound at all. Also, not portable.
