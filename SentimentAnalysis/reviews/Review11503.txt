What would I do without Alexa?  She hears perfectly from halfway across the house.  Amazing microphone!  The speaker is really nice and fills throughout the house.  Dot is really neat because you can plug it into a sound system.  It's too bad that both of my dots are useless because they don't like my wifi.  My echo is flawless, but my Dots are flawfull.
