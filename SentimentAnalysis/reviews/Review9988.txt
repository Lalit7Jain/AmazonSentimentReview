4 stars instead of 5 because of the physical design of the Echo. It's top heavy, which isn't the end of the world, but it wobbles. The base is not flat and it allows the Echo to wobble, or rock, back and forth (using the label for orientation). I sent the first one back thinking it must be flaw, but it's just the design as the second was identical. If you never touch the thing, you'd never notice, but since you can both mute and adjust the volume manually, you'll probably run into this. This make the Echo feel less than solid. It's a small thing, but it makes it feel cheap.
