the dot is  the best  save your money and buy the dot  the echo is triple the price and has less options such as pairing a Bluetooth speaker ... But imagine the little dot does the same as the big brother and has more options ..... But do not  get me wrong if you have no interest i paring a blue tooth speaker and you want a stand alone speaker buy the echo. The sound quality is descent but not as good if you pair it with a Bluetooth speaker
