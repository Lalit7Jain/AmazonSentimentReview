My husband loves this.  He wanted one after a couple friends purchased one and he got to 'play' with it all night.  It really is lovely to walk into our home and ask Alexa to play us some music or check the score or see what the weather will be like.  We love our Amazon Echo.  We've recommended it to several other friends.  Would buy again!
