I am somewhat savoy but had some trouble setting it up but I manged, I still have trouble adding App's to it.  Got a device to turn on a lamp, worked for over 3 hours using google, you tube and found a # for Amazon Tech support.  I could get my smart phone to turn on/off my lamp but after searching though again Google,You tube, etc. still could not get Echo to recognize my device.  The support person with Amazon told me I knew more than he did and I know very little.
