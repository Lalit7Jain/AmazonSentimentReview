UPDATE 1/18/2017: I've given the device an additional star as I've had more time to use it. The kids seem to enjoy playing games with it from time to time, and the family plays Jeopardy at dinner time. Although my wife maintains a facade of indifference toward the device overall, she does appear to enjoy using it from time to time for news and weather updates.  I've also got plans to integrate the device into my Homeseer automation system as there is a plug-in available. Once that is complete I may return to award Alexa another star; we'll see.
