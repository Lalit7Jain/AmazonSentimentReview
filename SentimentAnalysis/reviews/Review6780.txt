We, as a family, love Alexa!!  My youngest thoroughly enjoys playing around with her.  She is fun and informative in many ways.  We've also bought the Harmony hub and hooked it all in with the entertainment system, tv, surround, and bluray player, along with using IFTTT.  Alexa has exceeded expectations thus far.  I think she is a wise choice for those who enjoy the automation side of the world, especially for the cost, and her skills are growing constantly.  I have also gotten an Echo Dot for my room and plan to get atleast one more for the kids' rooms. I am extremely happy with Alexa, and do not regret my purchase in the least.  In fact, I highly recommend her to everyone I know, and strangers who read this!!  Thanks Amazon for yet another amazing creation!!!
