The device is great! The ability to control my Philips HUE lights is amazing and I even can do scenes (lighting color schemes) through the ECHO. I have Samsung Smartthings connected as well so I can control my air conditioner and fans with my voice. I have a total of three ECHOs (One Big ECHO and two ECHO DOTs). Sometimes two pickup my voice at the same time but it seems the ECHO that gets the request first wins and the other one stops what it is attempting to do. The reason why it is not a full 5 stars is the lack of multi-room audio capability. I know they are adding SONOS compatibility soon but there are so many other systems that could use some love too! I have the Samsung Multi-Room Audio System and I can only connect the ECHO DOTs to one speaker at a time while the Big ECHO can't connect to any Bluetooth speakers and only plays music through its own speaker. It is disappointing that I have a huge Bluetooth enabled soundbar with sub-woofer next to my Big ECHO and I can't play music to it from the ECHO. WHY? If Amazon can add multi-point Bluetooth to the ECHO and ECHO DOTs this would be a non-issue. I have to say everything else is FANTASTIC! I have a news briefing in the morning from whatever ECHO I'm next to at the time that I've customize to my liking, It plays pretty much any song I want from Amazon Prime, Spotify, and any channel of Pandora I'm feeling at the time. I've even asked it to play me some fun music or relaxing music and it does a great job of interpreting what music fits my mood! All-in-all I recommend it to anyone with a smart home system or anyone who is just a curious person because Alexa will answer whatever you want pretty effectively! If you like your music I recommend the ECHO DOT because it has audio out and Bluetooth audio to a speaker of your choosing. I have multiple speakers connected to my DOTs but you can only play out from one at a time and you can't switch the speaker with your voice, only through the Alexa app.
