There's so much you can do with Alexa through Amazon's Eco-System and Wikipedia the possibilities are endless, and Amazon is constantly updating her skills in the Alexa app they send an e-mail every Friday with a new skill. That's all I can say now but no home is complete without Alexa!! Thank you for reading my review.
