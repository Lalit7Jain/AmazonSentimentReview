I love our Echo.  Great sound quality.  If you are thinking about buying a quality Bluetooth speaker, just buy the Echo for about the same price and get Alexa as a bonus.  The only negative comment I have is that when music is playing at volume 8 or higher, Alexa's voice control dies not work unless you are yelling from a few feet away.  Obviously, the loud music drowns out the voice recognition, so shame on me for asking Alexa to play anything at volume 10.  Otherwise, great product!
