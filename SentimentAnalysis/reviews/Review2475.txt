I recieved my Echo as a Valentine's gift from my parents and absolutely love it!!! I'm a pretty tech-mad person and love having my gadgets. I'd been wanting the Echo for awhile, though part of me questioned its usefulness. Well, my parents know me too well and they gifted it to me almost a week ago. Since then, I've found several reasons to love my Echo. One of the most obvious is the music streaming capabilities on it. It's easy to stream from Amazon music or hook it up to my iPhone or iPad to play music or other audio that way. I'm partially blind and will say that the Echo, particularly for its audio and voice capabilities, is an insanely blind-friendly device. The Alexa voice service very seldom fails to understand my commands and I'm always figuring out new tips and tricks. The ability for Alexa to play Kindle and Audible books thrills me as well as I do enjoy a good read when I'm not otherwise caught up in school, family, or video games. If I can get my Echo to read my PDF textbooks then I'll be an even happier camper than I already am. I'm also very excited about my Echo's smart home potential. I look forward to the day I have smart lights and, eventually, even a smart thermostat where I can tell Alexa to change the temperature at a whim rather than squinting at the display of my current thermostat. I'll end this by saying that I love my Echo and can only see myself loving it more as time marches on.
