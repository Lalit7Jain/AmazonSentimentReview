Amazon Unlimited, once you get past the autotuned nonsense that it initially recommends, is actually pretty good.  That stations and algorithms seems to work pretty well, and the bit rate seems like it is fairly high.  No noticeable distortion that you'd hear with lower bitrates, especially with guitars and cymbals and the like.  Audiophiles will have their own opinions on this one.
