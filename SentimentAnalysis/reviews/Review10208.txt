This is (in my opinion) very handy, and has more and more functionality being added all the time. The echo can do anything from playing music from Pandora, iHeart, Amazon music etc, to updating a grocery list, turning lights on and off, ordering a pizza, accessing Wikepedia, getting weather and traffic updates etc.
