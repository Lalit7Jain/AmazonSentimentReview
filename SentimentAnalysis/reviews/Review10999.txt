Cons:  Very limited as far as usefulness.  We don't have a lot of smart home integration, which may make Echo more useful for some.  Otherwise, most of the available apps suck, and Alexa's text to speech is pretty awful to listen to.  Too bad.  There is a lot of room to make fun and useful voice apps, but as of now we are nowhere near "fun" and barely reaching "useful."  Hopefully it isn't consuming too much energy (on all the time), or spying on my family.  If you ask Alexa, like most questions, she won't understand.
