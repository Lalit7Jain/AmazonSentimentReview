This is one of the great new consumer devices in the last decade. As a general user or tech geek like myself, this has quickly become a must-have appliance. I control our entire home automation system with it: lights, window shades, temperature, TV, temperature, etc. (Note that you must have an existing home automation system for some of these items). But even basic tasks like updating items on our shopping list, ordering, getting answers to simple or complex questions and much more, all become a basic part of your lifestyle once you start using it. The amount of enhanced technology inside of this device makes it a bargain as well. Excellent work Amazon!
