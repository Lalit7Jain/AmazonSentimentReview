Phrasing seems to be important with Alexa. For instance after enabling certain skills Alexa may not recognize them if I ask her to launch a skill with slightly different wording. 2 examples I have come across are "Alexa, let's play Jeopardy!" (Alexa tells me skill is not enabled) versus "Alexa, open Jeopardy!" (Jeopardy! opens). And also, "Alexa, open today in history" (Alexa tells me the skill is not enabled) versus "Alexa, open this day in history" (opens skill). Phrasing seems fairly important in other questions too. I asked Alexa a moment ago what 281.66 x 2 is. I phrased it differently until she responded with an answer to the fourth phrase.
