They seem to have a problem with the power adapter.  Mine quit working one day after I unplugged it and then plugged it back in to get the Echo rebooted.  Never came back on.  I went online and found that many people had encountered a similar problem.  No knowing whether it was the adapter or the Echo that had died I tried the online warranty claim with Amazon.  They wanted me to ship to their facility where they would check it out.  I inquired about the adapter problem that I had read about.  I was told that if the Echo tested out OK they would send me a voucher to purchase a new adapter.  Seemed like too much of a hassle.  I just purchased an alternative adapter from Amazon for $15.  Worked like a charm!  Cost me $15 that it shouldn't have but was better then shipping a unit back and forth and waiting for it all to happen.
