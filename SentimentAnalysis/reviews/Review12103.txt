It works OK some of the times. other times I have to yell at it as if it was a little kid. The value of eight or nine it cannot hear me,  I have to manually go up to it and turn it down or even at a  lower level I have to talk very loud,  to it I've tried talking to it while in another room it will not respond. It does not work while the water is running not sure what version they are using in the advertising but mines does not work this way  is my second unit still needs.  Doesn't work you can ask at the weather and it works with no problem same for sports updates and for Pandora music that's when it's working 2 1/2 star a minimum
