Amazon does not provide a remote.  It used to have a remote in the box.  They have taken it out and now charge you for a remote.  Some functions of the Echo require a remote to identify an electronic device.  Without the remote you are dead in the water.  It is an Amazon rip off.  They do not tell you this when you read the information  about the Echo.  Be aware!
