At 69 years old and not having my nose continually stuck to a cell phone, I find it grossly annoying that I can't even remove items from a grocery list without going to the computer.  Seriously...who wants to do that?  I can't go to the internet.  You should be able to tell Alexa to go to Google or whatever you're using and all I get is "That's not available".  So far, I've found this useful for the local weather report for two or three days, a few songs Amazon Prime doesn't want to charge me for and getting the local radio station by call #'s.
