This review is likely a drop in the bucket, but we do love our Amazon Echo. We use it way more often than our high quality bluetooth speakers because of the convenience of waking up "Alexa" using nothing but our words. I find myself using the Echo mostly for music (it is connected to our Pandora, Spotify and Amazon Music accounts), but also to create shopping lists, get the weather, track traffic and even do basic arithmetic. We have recommended it to our friends and purchased an additional one as a gift.
