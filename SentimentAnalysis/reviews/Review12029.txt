I bought this product to help streamline our family calendar and help me with our shopping list.  Not only has it transformed both of these items in our family's life, but Alexa is a favorite in our household for music, homework questions from kids, traffic information for my husband's commute, and we even use it for our TV to find out what's coming up to watch!
