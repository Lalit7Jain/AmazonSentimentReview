Needs to get smarter. It doesn't answer ?s like google does. It often answers our ?s with "I'm sorry I don't understand" but it is good for weather & sports updates and I guess smart home duties which we don't use. Our family wants to be able to ask ?s and get answers. I bought this and Dots for bedrooms which have the same issues. I am hopeful that ongoing updates will make it better.
