Well, I thought that it would speak to me when I need it to remind me of appointments!  I guess I really don't know how to use it, & need some structural advice by a real person!  I purchased it so that it could help my husband who had several strokes by reminding him of thing of importance!  Clearly I need help learning how to operate this wonderful gadget!
