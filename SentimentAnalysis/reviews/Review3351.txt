What a blast !  My wife my self and my brother in law and his wife set here for almost 2 hours trying to find a song that Alexa did not know or could not find. We were playing songs out of the 1950's and 1960's she got every one. The sound is very good and it is easy to use. I should have got this a long time ago. I would recommend this to my friends.
