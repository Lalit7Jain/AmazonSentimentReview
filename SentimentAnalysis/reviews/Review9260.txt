Skills are hit-or-miss. They are very easy to install, you just click "enable" and wait a few seconds. Most of them are great and work as described, but for some of them the voice commands don't work or the answers are jumbled (especially if it's reading from a live feed). Some of my favorites are chat bot (hilarious insults & really sweet compliments) and Motivate Me Please.
