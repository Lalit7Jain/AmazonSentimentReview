I seriously cannot recommend the Echo enough.  We have 2 in our home.  The sound is great and the functionality is stellar.  I use it for music, home automation, weather, news, as a time, to take notes and for Audible primarily.  It is so nice to have it in the middle of things so everyone can use it.  It is well constructed and easy to use.  Buy it now. You will not regret it.
