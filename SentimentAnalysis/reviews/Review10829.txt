This all started as soon as Amazon started offering My Music, all their music for $7.99. The 1,000 albums I purchased need to be played on a competitors machine. I wasted the money for all those Albums plus the Cost of the Echo and the Tap. You might find them in the woods behind my house after I throw them out the back door.
