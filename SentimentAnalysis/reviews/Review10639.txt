Alexa, what's on my calendar today.  What can I say; I love it. My kids got it for me last Christmas and I literally had no idea what the 'Echo' was. Well, I found out real quick and believe me it goes all over the house with me.  Kitchen, lower level where I sew, bedroom, Can't wait to add an Echo Dot to it so I don't have to carry it around.  I listen to music, books, news.  Folks, it's the best. Great sound as well and great to give as a gift.
