I reviewed this product app. a year ago and have decided to add a few more comments.  As a serious audiophile and in addition to spending big bucks on stereo equipment, I look for a sound that is pleasant to the ears.  I am pleased to say that the Echo is surprisingly good for the low cost.  I have compared it to both my Bose Wave system and my Bose mini speakers II. The only difference is less bass at the low end but overall the Echo has a nice balanced sound that is pleasant to listen to in my bedroom.  It will hold its own against these items that cost more.
