I told Alexa I needed a hug - she apologized for not having arms! Love it! I ask her what to wear in the morning and her suggestions are great! We've even had an argument - just what I need sometimes! Am looking forward to learning more. This was a gift from my daughter - what a gift - thanks honey!
