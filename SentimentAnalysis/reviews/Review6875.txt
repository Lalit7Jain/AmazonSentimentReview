Alexa "Amazon Echo" is in my opinion a big disappointment. First off why call it echo but when you want to talk to it you call it alexa? It (she) doesn't have a good search engine or maybe not one at all. It wouldn't even play all the songs from spotify. If all you want is an alarm clock and to ask it the weather and order some things from amazon then get the echo. But Im sending it back and trying out the Google home.
