Based on countless positive review from dominantly English native speaker and i want to see if I can use Echo to listen to Vietnamese music. I subscribed to Amazon Prime Music today and started adding some albums and song to My Music and then tried it with Alexa. The results were mixed; I said " Alexa, play music from Tuan Ngoc", to my surprise it worked. However, when i tried it again 30 min later, it would not understand me!!!!
