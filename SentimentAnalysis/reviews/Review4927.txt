Another feature I'd like would be ability to add a bluetooth speaker so that there could be sound at both ends of a room. I do miss my "stereo" sound, but the ease of using Alexa is changing how I access my music (is there a slogan there? ;) ). Many have said that Alexa's speaker misses the bass. I am not a soundaphile, but I do find this is true but not to the point of me wanting a dot with bluetooth--because there would be more wires and need to sync the speaker each time it is accessed which to me, is too clumsy.
