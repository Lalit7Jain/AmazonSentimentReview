Alexa is mostly another marketing gimmick to get you to buy additional items such as Prime music or expensive wifi Alexa controlled thermostats, etc. Or the stand that only takes up more counter space and collects dust. Many of the requests you make to Alexa only responds with "can't answer that, go to my app or this song request requires Prime music". Also the device can't answer many simple questions that are right there in google. There are really only a few useful things Alexa does without added expense. Set a timer (so you don't have to push microwave buttons)  shuffle music, and check the temp. outside. The concept is great but the current model is way too restrictive right out of the box.
