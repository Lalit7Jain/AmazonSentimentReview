The music selection from Amazon Prime is alright but leaves a lot to be desired.  Asking her to play "Rock" music will playing the same rock playlist that starts with a Disturbed song.  I've experienced similar issues with other genres as well.  Alexa lacks the capability to block or automatically skip artists.  This is even more problematic because asking her to play pop songs will get you more Adele then you have ever wanted to hear.  This wouldn't be so bad, but skipping songs via voice is tedious as you have to yell over the speaker to be heard.
