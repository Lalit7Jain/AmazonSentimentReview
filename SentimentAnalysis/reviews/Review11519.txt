Update: So I called in. An agent picked up, asked many questions, tossed it to 2nd agent, asked many questions, NOW the 3rd agent. By this, time passed 25 minutes and I was standing in the street. Then this 3rd person told me to check ECHO.. If this would include a Time-Warner type of step-by-step check-up, why not told me in the beginning??? I wasted my time, and NOTHING RESOLVED.
