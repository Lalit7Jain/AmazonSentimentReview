"Alexa, can you make for me medium brew coffee, and do the laundy.." Okay, says Alexa. Just kidding but this product is beyond awesome. It is a game-changer and makes wonder how life used to be before Alexa came along.  I purchased Amazon echo (the big one) and six Echo Dots (4 as gifts to others and 2 for wife's office/our kitchen). I'm planing on adding two additional ones, for my office and home theater. Wife likes it, peace in the house, and here is why: as long as you have Wifi, set up is a breeze. Unlike Siri, Alexa is so intuitive and listening at all times that even a nearby TV show does turn it on. People with accents be damed..Alexa can hear you very well. The Amazon Echo is in my master bedroom: once it was set up, I went into the Skills (under settings) and connected it to my Kasa (smart lighting ).  I have six Kasa bulbs in my bedroom. So here is how awesome Alexa is: when I go to bed,  I just lay down and calmly ask Alexa to play Yo-Yo Ma music from Amazon Prime Account. I turn around and say Alexa, bedroom lights off, and Alexa respond by saying, Okay. Lights off. I ask Alexa to play and turn itself off after say 30 mins - which it does. At 5:00am, Alexa alarm comes on. At the same time, it turns on the Kasa smart bulbs.  When leaving the bedroom, I just say Alexa, bedroom lights off. When we are cooking, my family likes to play trivia games including Jeopardy with EchoDot which is strategically placed in our kitchen. Next task is to connect Alexa to my home theater system. My brother in-law has such a set-up and it is beyond believable, it awesome i.e. Alexa, tell harmony to turn on Netflix and dim the lights.
