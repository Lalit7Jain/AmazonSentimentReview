I wish I could give this a 10 star rating because I love it so much, but the truth is Alexia is about as smart as a new puppy!  When I ask for the Trawlerman's Song by Mark Knopfler (I know she can because she plays it on the Shangri-la Album!) she instead plays Troller man by someone I've never heard of. She started one day out by saying "Today is the day that Roger Staubach threw the "Hail Mary pass" and then when I ask her who received that pass (Drew Pearson) she doesn't know!  It can be very frustrating!  She sounds like an adult but she's really a very limited child!  In frustration one day I asked if she was stupid!  She told me she was still learning!  But, do I like Alexia?  Yes!  I love her and I am thrilled to have the service!  It's not perfect and can certainly be frustrating!  It's hard not to think of Alexia as real person!  To quote Sir Paul "I got to believe it's getting better, getting better all the time!
