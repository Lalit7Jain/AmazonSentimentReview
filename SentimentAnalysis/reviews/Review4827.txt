The audio quality isn't great, I'd say it's below the quality of my Bose SoundLink Color Bluetooth speaker.  However, it's not bad either, it's definitely usable if you're just looking for some background music. A nice feature would be the ability to use the Echo to connect to another bluetooth speaker, however this isn't available with the Echo (the Dot apparently can do this).  The Echo is only able to act as a bluetooth receiver, not transmitter.
