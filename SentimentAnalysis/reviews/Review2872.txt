The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars for now is that the Bluetooth only connects devices to the Echo and you can not connect BT Speakers to it like the Dot (Gen 2), You can only use 1 Harmony Hub so if you want to control more than one tv in a different room you need to buy something else, I am waiting for AnyMote Ir blaster to come in and im hoping that might give me more options but if not I can control 2 TV's in 2 rooms using both devices this way, . If the skills allow more integrations later like calling/texting people using trusted services or linking cell phones , Intercom between devices, the Alexa app on ph also doubles as an Alexa device to be used when mobile not just setting up the Echo and Dot skills, other manufactures make accessories that work better so I can get BT or Wifi speakers etc that can be cut on using Skills and not using automation devices or leaving speakers on to make more convenient  Also note you have to upgrade your Prime Music or purchase the individual music plan to be able to stream any music to all amazon devices (dots, Echo's etc using amazon services, Right now I use Spotify for me and the amazon service for family. That would be my wish list but out of the box it is still worth getting and the price is reasonable.
