Do you love yelling at an inanimate object because it can't understand you and has absolutely no cognitive ability to comprehend what it's done wrong? Then try this thing! :) Enjoy the frustration when it confindantly carries out its misheard instructions forcing you to yell things like, "No! Alexa, stop!" Or "OMG Alexa stfu!!". Do you like how when talking to Siri you can edit the text it "heard" when it misheard you? Yeah Alexa doesn't have that ... At all. Do you enjoy listening to music with even remotely hard to understand song or artist names? Hahahha well your screwed. Also enjoy listening to hour long podcasts that you can't rewind or fast-forward, forcing you to just use your computer. All this with the added benefit of giving Amazon and Jeff Bezos access to a highly sensitive microphone in every room of your house!
