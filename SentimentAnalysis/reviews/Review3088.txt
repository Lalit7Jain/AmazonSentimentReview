Doesn't do internet searches, doesn't has good understanding as Google AI, doesn't do and send maps and directions to phone, doesn't call phone numbers, doesn't integrate with Chromecast, and music is stuck every time at "buy Amazon music " , can't even sing poems like Twinkle Twinkle little star without subscription to Amazon Music for $8 / month . I am not sure what it's good for,Siri and Google Assistants are far far better.
