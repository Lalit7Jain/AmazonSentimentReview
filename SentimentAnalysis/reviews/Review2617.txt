1. You have to be very precise when asking Alexa a question. The phrasing is important or she does not understand. For example: when I ask her for a Random Fact, she does not understand until I phrase it, "Alexa, ask Random Fact for a Fact." This would not be so bad if all the requests were phrased the same way, but when you want to find out which holidays are being celebrated daily you must use this phrasing, "Alexa, ask National Day Tracker which holidays are being celebrated today." Other requests require different phrasing which Alexa often claims she does not understand encouraging you to enable the skill which has already been enable.  She also does not quite get what you are asking when using the grocery list app. Instead of mayonnaise, she lists may, or instead of red beans, bens.
