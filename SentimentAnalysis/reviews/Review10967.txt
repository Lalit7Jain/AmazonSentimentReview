Rubbish. It can'd do anything useful unless you are tied in with Amazon's various music software accounts and so on so if you ask it to play a song from the internet - it can't do it. If you ask it say "what sound does a cow make" if can't do it. It is like a terrible version of google's search engine basically. Moreover, it doesn't work when you are abroad in another country. You can't even download the mandatory app as it is IP restricted!!! I've put my alex in a corner unplugged where it will remain I'm afraid. Complete and utter waste of money and effort.Don't buy this, I'm told the google version should be better but who knows.
