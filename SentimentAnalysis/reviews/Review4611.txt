I Love Amazon Echo!!! I have Alexa telling me the weather, turning on and off lights, telling me jokes, If not sure how to spell a word I ask Alexa and she spell it for me, she reads my books, she play my music, sets timers for cooking, sets alarms, converts feet to pounds, turns volume up and down, connects to my iPhone, iPad. There is so much more then she can do it would take me way to long to list them. Buy one you will change your Life and you will Love her. Cheers...
