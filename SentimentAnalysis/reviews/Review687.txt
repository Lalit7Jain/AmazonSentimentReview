Absolutely wonderful piece of technology. Very happy I invested in this. The speaker is great for the size and I haven't had any problems except her misunderstanding me every once in a while. This has improved how I do things in my day to day life, and it continues to impress me. If you are on the fence about it I recommend just doing it.
