It is definitely fun to play around with. With that said you kind of find what you get used to using it for and for me it is mostly the timer/alarm, weather, music, and sport updates.  I'm setting up WeMo switches so I can use it for my lamp in my coffee pot. The lamp works awesome but I have yet to set up my coffee pot.
