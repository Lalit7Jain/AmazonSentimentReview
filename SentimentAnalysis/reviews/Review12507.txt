This was the first real voice assistant and for a short time still the only standalone option.  Amazon got a lot right with the Echo and the Dot, however they are going to have to make many improvements soon to stay competitive if the Google product does everything they claim.  The biggest issue with the Echo for me is the lack of a way to sync playback across multiple Echos and Dots throughout the house, or any compatible devices to make that possible.  Also it sounds like the Google product is going to be far more conversational and contextual making it far easier to interact with.  Still Amazon is way ahead of the Google in compatible devices and adoption since the Echo family is a mature product and Google hasn't even released theirs yet, however they do have a surprising number of companies that have already said they plan to be compatible shortly after release.
