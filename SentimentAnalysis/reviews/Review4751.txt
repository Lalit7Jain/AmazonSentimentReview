Highly recommend it. I received it a week and a half before the actual delivery date. Still getting use to it and trying to figure it out. The little time I was using it i could say it's amazing!!! I wasn't expecting a big speaker taught it be small like other little speakers. Well worth my money! Sounds nice and loud.
