I LOVE MY ALEXA. I love that I can play music without moving from my bed. I don't have to roll over when I'm cozy and check the time. Alexa can answer pretty much any question I ask her. It is SO convenient! I would recommend it to everyone. It is expensive, but very much worth it. My mom was PISSED when she found out how much money I spent on Alexa. However, once she started playing around with it, even SHE said, "Okay, for everything that it does, the price isn't too bad"
