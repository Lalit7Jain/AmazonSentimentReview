What can one say about the Echo that has not been already written? I decided to give myself one for Christmas, and I am glad I purchased it on Black Friday; had I waited much longer, they would have been sold out for Christmas Delivery. I am still learning all the wondrous things Alexa can do, and I must say it is a lot of fun! Being a Prime member, I am enjoying access to Prime Music, and I am currently trying out the Unlimited Music. Not sure if I will ever use Alexa to control things like garage doors, sprinklers, etc., but I am quite happy with this product so far.
