Ok, its neat, but the newness wears off fast.  I love my daily flash briefing and its neat to be able to launch a radio station, a news podcast or even a game by voice.  However, there just isn't enough useful content yet.  And I really use this thing.  I have had it read me recipes while I'm cooking (it will even create an ingredients list on your smartphone), play BPM workouts while I'm on the elliptical, I've even played a couple rounds of Jeopardy. All good stuff, just needs a lot more of it. The majority of the functions currently available aren't very good or particularly useful.  There are a select few that are awesome (Tune in for podcasts and radio stations, All recipes, flash briefing of your favorite news sources), and I would love to see Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha make it onto the Echo.  Kind of like when you're looking at apps on Google Play.  I give Amazon a lot of kudos for bringing essentially what is "smartradio" into households.  The sound quality is very good but one of the most annoying features on this is volume control.  When you are listening to music at a high volume, you have to practically scream at the device so it can hear your command when you want to turn it down. The other annoying feature occurs if you are watching tv and someone happens to say "alexa".  I recommend putting it on standby if you will be watching tv for a few hours so it doesn't interrupt you.
