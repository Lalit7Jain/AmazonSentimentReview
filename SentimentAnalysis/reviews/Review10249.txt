As a bluetooth speaker, I use it a lot to connect it to devices that have media that I want to play on the device. It's very cool to be able to just say "Connect to blah blah blah" and it finds and connects to that device. This bluetooth feature works well for those who have a large library of something like music or talk shows or anything audio on a bluetooth enabled device that you want on a bigger speaker.
