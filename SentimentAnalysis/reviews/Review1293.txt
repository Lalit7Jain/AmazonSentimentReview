Just added wifi enabled lights in our house -- just to see if Alexa's "user interface" was as easy as I hoped it would be.  It is. I have, subsequently, ordered additional lighting -- and am using bulbs that do NOT require a hub.  The cool thing is, I can control my lights with Alexa AND when I'm not at home I can control the lights with my smartphone.
