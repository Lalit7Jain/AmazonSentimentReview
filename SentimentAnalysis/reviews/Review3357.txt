What can we say??  Alexa is awesome!  Sometimes you have to re-word your command or question but Alexa keeps trying and will always get it right.  We took this on a family vacation with us and the whole family had fun with it.  During many conversations when we could not remember  details or definitions of something, we would ask Alexa!!  The ECHO also has a very good sounding speaker, we play music through it very often!  Did a lot of dancing on vacation too!
