Unlike Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, Jeff Bezos has stated that Amazon will comply with any and all subpoenas and warrants for full voice data with account holder's personal contact information.  So while with Apple your data can't be tied to you and is therefore useless to criminal hackers, stalkers or even the governments of the world; Amazon is a potential goldmine to hackers & thieves.  Not to mention Communist governments, Muslim Sharia courts & dictators around the world depending upon your devices location.
