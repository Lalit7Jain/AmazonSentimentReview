Another key missing feature is the ability to have Echo give you the latest stock quotes on ticker symbols you ask about. More ideally, it should be able to give you a rundown of your entire portfolio with one request. Your daily briefing can only be tailored to general areas of interest or the top few stories of a few specific news outlets. You cannot, for example, give it a list of companies that you want to hear news about daily. You can't give it a specific topic to address, either. Try to add gene splicing news or electric car news to your briefing. You can't narrow the topics of your daily briefing very much at all. As such, it is fairly useless to me, because the information it provides is general news I already knew. I want in depth details about about the specific events/topics/companies I choose.
