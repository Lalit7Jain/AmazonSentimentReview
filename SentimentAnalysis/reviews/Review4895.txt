Excellent product and definitely deserves 5 stars.  One thing I would really like to ask Amazon though is to create Echo's that are receivers only.  Why?  Well it is very nice to just tell Alexa to turn on a certain channel without needing a remote control.  This however will not work well when the volume is loud.  Other one is when you want the full sized echo to play music in the main room when you are not in direct view.  This requires yelling which is not great as well.  If you have an echo it plays out of the small speaker on the dot. Not great as well.  Lastly, what if you tell the large Alexa to play music and she is playing it loud.  You literally have to get right in front of it to get her to stop since it cannot hear over the music.  SO A SHOUT OUT TO AMAZON.  FIX THIS ISSUE and that would be awesome.  I CAN HEAR ALEXA LOUDLY ALMOST ANYWHERE, BUT HARD FOR IT TO HEAR ME.  VOICE RECEIVERS IS AN EASY SOLUTION.
