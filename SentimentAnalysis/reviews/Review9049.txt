3. Music - I love music, and I always have to have it on wherever I go. Short of an intercom/music system, our Echos are perfect. Music is one of those things that I always found to be painful. Before I would have a BT speaker which I'd have to pair to my phone then open an app (Amazon Music/Pandora) to get music. Now I just tell Alexa to play a playlist/music/pandora, and I'm done. The Echo really is perfect as a music vehicle, and if I need to exert more control I can use the app.
