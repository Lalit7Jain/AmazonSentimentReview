I am a huge fan of the echo and the technology. We have several echos, dots, and a tap in the house. We use it to turn on/off our tankless water heater, thermostat, outdoor lights (including landscape lights), basic pool functions, and play music. It's also a fun device with guests that visit and aren't familiar with it. A couple of recommendations for Amazon engineers, please create an outdoor solar powered speaker that I can place throughout the backyard, allow music to stream on multiple devices, create sound bars and other types of Alexa integrated speakers, tap is great, but create a battery powered version of the Echo so I can place it in the middle of a room without needing a cord, work with LiftMaster to allow Alexa to open/close the garage door, and integrate Alexa with home wired alarm systems (not just the cheap wireless systems), though I think it's the alarm companies that don't want to give up their total control of the system.
