The main reason I take a star off is she is just not the same as before (can't be because of her scratches because after this she still was fine). She was pretty cool when I first met her but now she lost a lot of that glitter. She is still pretty nice but I have been using the Echo for awhile I feel like she's going a bit crazy now. Sometimes the Echo hears my requests, responds appropriately, but does not execute. For example, I have a lamp connected to my Echo. Here's the process, I ask Echo to turn lamp on --> She says "Okay" --> lamp doesn't turn on. Sometimes my Echo takes awhile to process my requests. Sometimes my Echo executes another action then intended.
