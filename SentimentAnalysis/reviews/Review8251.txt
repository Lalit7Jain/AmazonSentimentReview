I've noticed (and mostly agree with) all the rave reviews on here which focused entirely on the relatively simple things Echo is able to do fairly well. At the same time, however, I've also noticed very few reviews pointing out the obvious things Echo should realistically be able to do, but currently can't. I'll try to give you a sampling of the more obvious missing features for a WiFi device that could potentially be sitting in every room of your house.
