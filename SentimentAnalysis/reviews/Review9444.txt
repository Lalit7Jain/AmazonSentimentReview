Not hapy with this so far. I have had it a week and still can not get it to connect to my hue hub or my z wave lock. I had to re run setup several times! I know many people like this however I get more IDK answers from it then I get actual answers. I used it side by side with Google home and it did not fair well. Google home answered so many more questions. The only thing this has over  google is the puck. you have to get the google home unit for each room you want to use it in but the echo can add the puck at a lower price to other rooms. If you want more answers get Google. Echo at this time also lists more thing it can connect to, however I am having issues connecting it to anything!
