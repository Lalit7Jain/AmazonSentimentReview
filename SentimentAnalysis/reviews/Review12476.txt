I move it around the house depending on what I'm doing at that moment, which is why it loses one star - I wish it was portable. Being tethered to a wall outlet is rather annoying, and waiting a minute for it to boot up after being plugged back in feels like an extraordinary long time. However, that problem will be solved once my Echo Dots arrive.
