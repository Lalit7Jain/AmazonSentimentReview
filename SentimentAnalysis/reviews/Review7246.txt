So far, as far as speaker and sound quality, I think it works well as a stand alone speaker. I have not hooked up any other devices to it through bluetooth. I've been playing Pandora through it, which is more enjoyable now than having to load the app on my phone, and then connect it to whatever device. There is a good amount of bass from the subwoofer, and the maximum volume setting is loud, with no distortions that I've noticed. The only thing is that when the volume is cranked, it can have a problem hearing you. But this could also be because I have it sitting to close to a wall, so the echoing probably intensifies.
