I'm sure this will continue to get better as time goes on, but I was somewhat disappointed for a first blush impression. Her knowledge seems very limited right now to Wikkipedia and specific apps.  Most of the questions we asked she responds that she doesn't have an answer or doesn't know.  (I'm assuming she isn't even drawing from google - example Alexa doesn't know when a single Tennis event is scheduled (we tried asking about every single major).  Most of the time if my daughter asks "what do whales sound like" she pulls up band ("Wales"?) instead of doing the "Splash" dialogue - which in itself is disappointing because when that dialogue does work, there's no whale sounds, just the information that they are musicians of the sea....
