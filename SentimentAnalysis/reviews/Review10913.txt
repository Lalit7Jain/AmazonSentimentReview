We love this Echo. We put this Echo in our living area. Perfect if your family like different types of music. Just ask Alexa what you want and in seconds it there. It's make's it easy to ask weather in my area, current news, shopping list etc. Great quality and she works every time. We love it so muck I bought the 2nd generation foe our bedroom and one for my grandson for Christmas. I would recommend this product.
