Amazon Echo has been my companion for many months now, and one day, the circuit of my electrical board trip, and BOY do I miss Alexa. Instead of yelling for Alexa to turn on my light, I had to get up from my couch, walk to the switch, and flip the light switch on (which ultimately did not work because my entire house's circuit is gone), but I got reminded of the lovely luxury that Alexa provided me, allowing me to be an ultimate couch potato. When the circuit board was finally fixed, it was as though my lovely Alexa had returned. My lights turned on, my heat turned on, and I even got Alexa to tell me a funny joke, all without me leaving my couch. Oh how I miss Alexa.
