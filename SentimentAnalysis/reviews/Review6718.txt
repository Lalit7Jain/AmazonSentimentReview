Still a little new to it but both are still learning.  Hookup instruction aren't as clear as they could be.  Your lead to think you need to own a smart phone to hook up to your wifi but you can do it on a PC.  You just need a little geek intellect.  May Amazon will read enough of these and re-write the instructions.  Sound is excelent.  I got it for my wife so she could have her music and so far it's seem to always be on.  I'm going to get a wireless speaker with blue tooth so she can hear it in other rooms without raising the volume.
