My cats are in door cats, and sometimes they like to ....try to escape out the front door.  My echo is in the kitchen on the opposite side of the house as the front door....I uploaded the cat meowing app, used the voice command to start it - the cats were instantly distracted and I was able to cart all of the groceries and items from my car into the house with out closing the front door, or even having to lock up the cats. I estimate that if used on an occasional bases, I have 5 mins where I can have the front door open and the cats will be thoroughly distracted.  First Win.
