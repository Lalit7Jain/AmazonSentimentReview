 I have to attest that it has been an arduous journey.  But one thing that has made it possible for me to live on my own even though I am paralyzed from the chest down, is "smart technology."  For example, I am able to run my entire home with apps on my phone, computer or tablet.  I have lights, electric door locks, electric bed, air-conditioning/heat, cameras, both indoor and out side.  Smart technology allows me to input data on my laptop when I am laying in bed – I cannot use my arms when I am laying flat in bed because of the paralysis.  Up to this point, I have used input through joysticks that operate by using my mouth.  They work effectively but the joysticks must be placed specifically in front of my mouth and they have to remain there all night long.  Smart technology allows me to be able to live safely on my own and has even allowed me to help take care of my 75-year-old mother whose health is, due to God's grace and technology, now stable and she is actually helping me more each day.
