She is prompt with tons of trivia such as the ages of celebrities, the height of the Eiiffel Tower, geography, and so forth. But try asking, "Alexa, what is $138 dollars plus 15%." And she says she can't answer that. Nor can she answer something simpler, "What is 15% of 138 dollars?" [We laters discovered the word "dollars" was confusing Alexa. She could do the math if we omitted the word.) Google returns the correct answer to our original question in under two seconds--"one hundred fifty eight dollars and 70 cents). So the difficulty with Alexa is not the design of the hardware but the information she can access and/or the inquiries she is able to process. Google is exceptionally competent at both of these, and gets better just about every day in terms of intuitive responses. Google can follow a line of questioning, understanding that a follow-up question is based on previous ones.
