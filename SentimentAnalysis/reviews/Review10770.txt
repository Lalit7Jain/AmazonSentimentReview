My family LOVES our Echo. For over a year I kept ignoring Amazons offer on this device because I failed to reconize the possibilities. At a friend home they demo theirs and I was in love. Now my family could not be without our Echo. Not just for music but weather locally and nationally, traffic reports then there's the new bits. The Echo would make a fabulous gift plus one for your self. The quality sound is amazing. Even for our 22ft ceiling family room. Echo is lofty in weight so no risk of tipping over. My family has utilized the endless options that Echo offers.
