This is my wife's surprise birthday present that I'll give to her in a few weeks so I can't make a personal and conclusive product review.  The reason I gave it a "5" star is because my wife had done some research a few months ago and she told me she definitely wanted an Amazon Echo.  So, whatever the wife says, it has to be a "5" star no matter what the outcome, right!
