Took forever to get this in.  Got this one for my mother in law 82 years old.  We already have one and love it,  once we got her set up off her computer wifi she likes it.  She used different stations for her music as she doesn't want tied to monthly fee of Prime at her age ( don't blame her) she listens to music daily, when she's not playing her organ.  Asks questions and likes something to talk too! Ha!
