this thing is pretty good for listening to music and podcasts but that's about it. with the technology we have today i guessed i expected so much more out of the voice commands from asking questions. like siri can do. but for music and podcasts its great! the only reason it didnt get a 5 star is because it cannot set reminders and it cant sync with your google calendar and remind you of things on your schedule. if it had some of those features it would be a solid 5/5
