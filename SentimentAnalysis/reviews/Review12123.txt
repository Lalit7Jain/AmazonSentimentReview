I hope Amazon will learn from this review and fix these problems for others, but it’s too late for me. While going through all of these remarkable hassles, I was constantly re-evaluating my commitment to this device. I was deciding whether to spend up to $235 for what is essentially just a voice-activated speaker - $180 plus $25 for the subscription, $30 for an additional remote.
