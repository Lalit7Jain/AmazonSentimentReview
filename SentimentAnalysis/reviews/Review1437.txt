My Amazon Echo stopped working within 7 months from the date of purchase... I tried calling the customer support and couldn't connect. Since, I am travelling last 6 months I am never getting proper time to focus on these small things. Not sure what has to be done.. My direct line is +1 925-415-0154 or you can call on my India number +91 997-225-2270
