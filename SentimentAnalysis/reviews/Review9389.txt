I love my Echo!  I use it constantly to schedule appointments, add to a grocery list, get sports updates, answer questions and light & thermostat control. There is always room for improvement with new technology, but the Echo is definitely ahead of the game.  I also recently bought a Google Home, but they have a ways to go to catch up with the features if the Echo.  I also prefer the looks of the Echo to the Google Home.(It reminds me of an air freshener)  For those that like white instead of black, Echo now comes in white. I like my black.
