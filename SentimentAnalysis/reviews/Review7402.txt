I LOVE it! Just wayyyy to much fun! I feel so lazy using it hahah but I love it. I have to play around with it a bit more to see where the best spot in my house is, the Alexa couldn't hear me when it was up at volume 10, but that might be a minor adjustment of placement issues. Otherwise, my husband, kids and I are having a ball with it!
