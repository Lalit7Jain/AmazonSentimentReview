It's hard to explain just how useful the Echo is until you own one and start using it as part of your daily routine.  Getting weather, traffic, news,  are just some of the more common uses.  I manage my outlook calendar with Echo and I also use the unlimited music subscription.  Recently my wife and I have been adding Philips Hue lights to our home and it's nice to have Alexa turn your lights on and off for you.
