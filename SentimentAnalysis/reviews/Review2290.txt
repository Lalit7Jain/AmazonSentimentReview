I love my Echo, but the communication between Amazon and their clients need to be a bit clearer. I purchased the Echo on a 5 month installment plan. I paid the first payment with a gift and was planning on paying the payments with my gift card balance (Amazon customer service told me I could.) so when my payment came up due, they told me I COUND NOT use my gift card balance. Now I sending it back... very upset customer right now.
