I almost never write reviews and I own a ton of Amazon stock, but my experience with the Echo and the Dot is miserable and I am not a pc idiot. I also bought the Google Home unit. It was up and working in minutes right out of the box flawlessly.  The Amazon Echo is not for the novice to set up or the darn thing simply doesn't work correctly. We spent an HOUR on the phone with Amazon's tech group too, so it surely wasn't the operator. Send the Dot back. The Echo is going back now too!  Off to Best Buy to buy another Google Home. And no I don't work for Google>
