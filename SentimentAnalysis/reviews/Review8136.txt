I'm loving the Amazon Echo.  The initial setup was super easy and within moments I was having Alexa do simple things for me like "Play Broadway Musicals", "decrease volume", "increase volume".  A few extra minutes of setting up the WeMo outlets that I had also purchased and I was entertaining myself by having Alexa turn on and off my office lamps.
