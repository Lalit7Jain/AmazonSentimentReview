This product did not in any way exceed expectations. While I have used only a fraction of the features, I have already encountered a couple of would-be-deal-breakers for any future purchase like this. 1. There is no AUX cable, yet all lesser models have one. 2. The bluetooth option does not work if your wireless network is down. Thusly, I am unable to listen to music from a device. In defense, I bought the Alexa in lieu of buying bluetooth speaker (s) as a dual function. Clearly a bad idea. Had planned to link Alexa with other speakers throughout the house- which is clearly useless for bluetooth activity. Alexa is responsive, and the sound is great when connected. When dropping signal Alexa used to shout it out - day time or at 3AM. Amazon seems to have fixed that. In hindsight, I should have waited out the technology or just purchased a plain old speaker.
