I bought the Amazon Echo mostly because I just thought it would be neat to have to play my Audible audiobooks without having to use my phone or my computer while I cleaned, cooked, or worked with art supplies.  I have found the Echo to be even more useful than I had expected.  Yes, I do use it a lot for my audiobooks but I also have it play music, give me my daily news (Flash briefing that I have customized), play NPR podcasts (the NPR One Skill is essential for me!), play sounds of thunderstorms that I can fall asleep to while a sleep timer makes certain it shuts off when I want it to, play random games with, amuse visitors with bad jokes, silly stories, and just ask general questions of.  I love that it sends expanded information directly to my Fire and I honestly can't imagine going back to mornings without my Flash Briefing.
