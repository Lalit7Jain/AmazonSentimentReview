I live in Jamaica and wanted to be able to enjoy the Amazon Echo experience.  I actually ordered one only find out that this device does not work in my country.  As a loyal and frequent customer of Amazon I was extremely disappointed that you don't seem to value your customers outside of the US. I'm so very disappointed. Now I'll have to wait and see what Google Home does for it's overseas customers.
