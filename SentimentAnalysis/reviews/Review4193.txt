What can I say that hasn't already been said? This has quickly become my favorite gadget in the entire house. I have paired this device up with a Phillips HUE bridge and wireless light bulbs, WEMO insight switches and wall switches and a Logitech Harmony Hub to be able to control everything in my office just by talking to my Echo. I will soon be planning on adding additional smart devices to my set up to make my entire house function as a smart device.
