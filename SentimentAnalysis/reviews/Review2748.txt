Family likes it in the kitchen and it is great for adding items to our grocery list that is then linked to my wifes phone.  One HUGE drawback is that it will not link to Apple Music.  I know Amazon wants to own my life, but I already pay for Apple and I don't want to pay for the same thing twice.  If it would let us do Apple Music this would be a 5 star.
