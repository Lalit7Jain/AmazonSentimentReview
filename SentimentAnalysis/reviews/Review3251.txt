The Echo is a great buy for any household.  It comes in handy on so many occasions.  Whether playing music, checking traffic, hearing news updates, or even the weather, it always is reliable.  It also serves as a source for much fun and games!  And the volume level is incredible!  I can hear it throughout my house if turned up loud.
