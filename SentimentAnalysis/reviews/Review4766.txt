One major problem is that you cannot change the Timer sound.  The current sound is a sound that is difficult to hear at any volume and does not sound like an alarm.  You are able to change the Alarm sound but that requires you to select a time.  This doesn't help if you need to set a 10 minute timer for something like cooking. I know you can do the math and always set Alarms, but it is bizarre that they let you customize one and not the other. There are sync problems between the app and the unit that they are still working on. It would be nice if you could give verbal commands to change settings, but that all has to happen on the app. Which doesn't alway synch to the unit.
