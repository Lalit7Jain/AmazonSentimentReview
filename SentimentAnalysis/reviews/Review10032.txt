I have only had the device for a day and am having fun with it.  I am considering returning it though because reminders are just added to a list. It is handy to be able to ask her to remind you to do a task at a certain time, but if you have to remember to check a list it defeats the purpose!  A fun little gadget, but almost useless as an assistant and maybe not worth the price.
