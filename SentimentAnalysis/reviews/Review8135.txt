I bought the Amazon Echo as well as the Amazon Fire TV devices looking to start experimenting with voice technology and home automation.  I returned the Amazon Fire TV device before opening--I visited a friend's house who was using it and was really turned off by how hard it was to get the device to get past the Amazon product pushes before doing something simple like watching a TV show.  HOWEVER...
