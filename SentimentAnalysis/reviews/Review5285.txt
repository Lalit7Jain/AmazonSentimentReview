Having all of my smart devices (such as lights and TVs) plugged in and on so that I may control turning them on and off with apps and Alexa works great - until the power goes out at 5am. The moment the power returned, all my lights, TV, and even Alexa turned on. There may be a solution to this, but I will need to explore (such as setting schedules and having the devices check the schedule when powered back on). Until then, I fear power outages.
