I love Alexa. I have her making my shopping lists, adding dates to my calendar, turning my lights on and off and soon she will be locking/unlocking my doors and controlling my garage. My kids think it is fun to ask her funny questions or make her sing but generally she is a tool to make life a little easier. I am learning to add "skills" to Alexa so I can make her more available to do more tasks important to me. The Echo is easy to set up and very user friendly. Do you neeeeeeed Alexa, not really but I wanted her and she is working to make my home work for me and my family.
