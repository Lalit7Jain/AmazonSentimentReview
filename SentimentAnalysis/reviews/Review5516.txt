Awesome device.  I have MS, so I bought it to start making my home a smart home.  It does exactly what I want it too, and then some. I ordered a Nest thermostat to couple with her.  Works like a dream.  I just installed the Nest yesterday in -0 weather.  Easy.  Display is big and bright, and I can read it from Across the room.  Echo/Alexa was easy to set up, so don't believe the online negatives.  It was a little tricky for me as well, for quite a minutes.  Once I figured my mistake, it went super fast.  Echo will control your devices, just make sure to follow every step needed.  In the case of Nest specifically, I missed a step.  Go to the Nest device, Settings, and find the device name.  Then ask Echo to find that device.  I kept saying "nest" or "heat' etc, but I had forgotten when I set it up online I called it "hallway".  So, again, easy.  I have played with Echo for a month now, and I already loved how I could ask for music.  For such a small device, she has good sound.  I will not go as far as great, but dang- almost!  I have played with her everyday asking for the weather here as well as in my sometimes-winter getaway in Florida daily.  Very cool.  I have joked with her a little, just for kicks.  Sometimes she jokes with me, if she gets it.  All very handy stuff for a sometimes-shut-in who has a hard time moving.  I can't wait to now start looking at lighting systems and ceiling fan controls.  :)  Smart home 2017, here I come!  No HGTV contest needed!  LOL
