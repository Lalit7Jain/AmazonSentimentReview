Still learning about the device. I can't wait until Amazon can come up with the remarks for non questions. I hate her : "I don't understand the question". Get rid of this program and make a response that is humorous or more intelligent sounding. Overall I really like the product and it great for people with disabilities to control so many things by her voice.
