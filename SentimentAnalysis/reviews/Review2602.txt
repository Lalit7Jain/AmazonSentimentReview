Alexa does some things really well.  Her speaker is fantastic and she integrates with a ton of smart home devices.  Unfortunately, she's not always a great listener or a great doer.  Asking her to turn on the lights frequently get's me an acknowledgement and a dark room.  Occasionally asking for anything gets her to play some music.
