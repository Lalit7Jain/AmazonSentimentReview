Suddenly I can turn a light on that previously was the ONLY light in the upstairs hall that just happened to be controlled by a switch that was UPSTAIRS as far away from the stairs as you can get. Great. NOW I can carry my dog up (dachshund) with me without running up and down dealing with lights. And bonus I get in bed and tell my FIre to shut it off and it does. Echo dot coming soon to a bedroom near me!
