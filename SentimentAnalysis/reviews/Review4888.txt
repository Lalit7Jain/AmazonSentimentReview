I love this thing. It doesn't always understand exactly what I am saying all of the time, but for the most part it works very well. It hears me amazingly, and it sounds like a more natural AI than what you are used to (It doesn't sound so robotic). It's very helpful all around, especially in the kitchen (It's where I have mine). You can set timers, play music, ask it for conversions (like how many tablespoons are in a cup) and many other things. I really like my amazon echo, and would highly recommend it to anyone that is considering buying one. They are definitely worth it!!
