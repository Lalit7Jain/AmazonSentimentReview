There is a lot of potential for this device, but simply its not there yet.  There is too much to try to remember when giving commands that you stock up on all of these skills and end up not using it because you can't remember the prompts.  I've asked it a number of questions and it comes back saying it doesn't have an answer, but when I use Google assistant on my android, I get the answer - Amazon needs to work on that if it wants to compete with AI like Siri/Google Assistant.  I do enjoy the simple conveniences of setting a timer, weather, traffic, etc., but there is a lot of work needed here.
