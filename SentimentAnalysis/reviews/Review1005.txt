The basic function of Alexa is very good, that is playing music, telling time, setting timers and such. But it seems that almost every functional thing beyond the basics requires a smart phone or Android device of the latest OS or Apple and they have to be got from third parties through Google Play or Apple.  My problem is I don't have a smart phone and my Android device isn't of the needed vintage.
