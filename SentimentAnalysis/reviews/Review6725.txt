I am greatly disappointed with this purchase.  I bought this for my husband who is disabled (blind) and daughter (low vision and poor fine motor) hoping they could rely on this less than surfing the net.  First of all, unless you subscribe to Amazon music, the music library is very limited.  It cannot connect to our iTunes unless each and every time we sit down on the computer and make the connection manually. For two folks disabled, it is easier to just play iTunes off the computer.  The weather app is worthless.  It gives the high and low and current temperature of the day and whether there will be precipitation. But it gives us no idea how much.  Really.  a dusting of snow? a inch?  2 feet?  Nope, just "snow is in the forecast".  The to do list, alarm and reminder features are cool, but I expected more from a cylinder we paid $129 for (on Black Friday. otherwise it would have been $179).  Other than these 3 cool features, it seems it is only good at parlor tricks.  During Christmas dinner we got into a discussion on a movie and the question was raised who directed it.  Without getting  up, we asked Alexa.  Way cool.  But worth $129-$179?  Not really.
