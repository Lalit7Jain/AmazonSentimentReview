Having a lot of trouble with my Alexa and customer service is really really bad.  It's been over three weeks that they keep saying they are working on it and we still have seen no improvement.  What a sad turn of events because in my opinion, no one is working on helping us fix the problem.  There's no way it takes this long with no return phone call.  I think we got a lemon and there will be no resolution. We are stuck with a defective product and Amazon Customer Service has no intention of doing anything about it.
