I think this is a very cool device.  I just hope Amazon continues to improve it and add new features.  It could do so much more.  For example, it really needs a calling and texting feature.  It should come with built-in VOIP support so that it could function as a smart speaker phone.  I can connect my cell  phone to my 4 yr old entertainment system in my car and say call "person" but the Echo does not yet have this ability.  Queries such as "what is the crime rate in the US" or "is global warming real" should illicit an intelligent response.  Please send Alexa to college!
