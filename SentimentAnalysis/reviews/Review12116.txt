But back to Echo. Another battle I had with Alexa was that I assumed she could hear me at all. It’s quiet in my small house, and my office is just down the hall from her, but often I got no response to my voice commands. So I figured I’ll try using the Fire TV remote device to feed in my commands directly. I bought Fire TV initially because of the suggestion somewhere on the web site that it would work with Echo, which I planned to buy later (I don’t particularly like Fire TV, but at least it wasn’t expensive.)
