This is our second echo. I do love Alexa, however, I don't know what has happened with the update. Both of them now seem to be hard of hearing. They shut off while I am speaking to them, they act as if they don't hear me when I say "pause" or "stop." Echo used to hear these comands from across the room but now I practically have to be standing over it to get it to respond. This has to be an update issue. Please fix this problem.
