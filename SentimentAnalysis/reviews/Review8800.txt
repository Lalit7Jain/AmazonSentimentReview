Mom had a problem reaching a pull chain to turn on an overhead ceiling fan light. I thought this might be the perfect solution....and it is! I installed two outlet controls, one for the fan light, and another for the bedroom table lamp. Now when Mom enters the bedroom or wakes in the middle of the night she can turn the light on. When she is ready for bed she simple tells Alexa to turn out the light and she doesn't need to make those few steps in the dark. The fan light works equally well. She loves them both. The "extra" was how much she enjoys turning on music or setting a timer to make sure she doesn't over-bake the cake in the oven.
