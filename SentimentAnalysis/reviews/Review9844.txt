Alexa lives in my Greatroom.  Her sound quality is excellent and fills the main living area.  For the most part she is extremely smart.  I like waking up to an alarm that plays the news headlines.  She is great at math, world facts, weather and programmable tasks such as alarms, timers, grocery lists and calendars.  If I need some info otherwise I ask her Wikipedia.  She knows music tunes that become a party game of sorts at my house.
