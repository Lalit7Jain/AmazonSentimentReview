Love it, love it, love it!  I was dubious at first.  For some reason, the ads and reviews I saw/read just never resounded with me.  Then I visited my brother's house and, after seeing and hearing the Echo in action for an evening, I knew I had to have one.  My family and I now find ourselves listening to music all the time -- it's just so convenient (and fun) to shout out a request and hear it played without lifting a finger.  I highly recommend subscribing to Amazon Music Unlimited to REALLY unlock the Echo's potential.
