I am most definitely concerned with frequency response. "2.5 inch woofer delivers deep rich response." Not. "Echo has been fine-tuned to deliver crisp vocals with dynamic bass response." Not. Its dual downward-firing speakers produce 360° omni-directional audio to fill any room with immersive sound." Not. The sound is thin and boomy and since I already own several Airplay-enabled speaker systems, I'm not about to replace them with Echo-compatible ones. As far as I can tell Echo is not compatible with my Airplay-enabled Denon receivers.
