It works beautifully.  We got this for our daughter, as maybe the only practical non screen-driven option for listening to music, and all our kids have loved it.  It would be nice if Amazon recognized this aspect of the device's appeal and put more parental control options out there (e.g., songs with explicit lyrics won't play accidentally when the kids are trying to play their songs...), but it's a great product for our family.  Talking to Alexa is like what I imagine talking to Siri would be like if Siri were capable of understanding or doing anything useful...
