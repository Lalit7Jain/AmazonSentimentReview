Well, this is a beautiful piece of technology that has yet to realize it's full potential. The conversational quality of the voice recognition is very good, so the core capability is excellent. However: other than playing very attenuated playlists, checking the weather, and ordering creamed corn and dog food, Alexa disappoints. I tried connecting it to our Nest thermostats, and it was a total fail. Loaded a few skills, but none of them really work as expected. I feel like we have a toddler or a new puppy in the house. There is tremendous potential, but she's not very smart or capable yet...
