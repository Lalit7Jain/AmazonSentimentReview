We have both the Echo and the Tap. Both are great. The sound quality is impressive for the size of the device, and the voice recognition is quality. Alexa is now my kitchen timer, my Bluetooth speaker, my news feed, my traffic update, and my quick Google search. We use the Tap for when the husband is out in the garage and wants music, or for a sound machine in the bedroom at night. I'm impressed with all that Alexa can do, and I can't wait to see even more of her abilities as we connect to other smart home devices.
