Excellent and interactive step into the march to artificial intelligence. Surprisingly fast response to questions posed and a real office and home assistance too.  It's definitely a needed accoutrement to every household and office environment.  If I have a complaint it is simply in the low fidelity sound which makes music listening muddy.  In all other respects the Alexa voice recognition is superb and the fact that "she" learns and keeps adding more and more information is quite remarkable. As a senior citizen, I find this device a necessary part of my daily routines and urge people considering a purchase to own Echo and at least some room extensions as well.  Well Done Amazon!
