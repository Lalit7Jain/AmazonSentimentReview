"1","Love it. I don't like how my kids talk to her but I love having it!! Hands free!! I wish it was cordless.","Positive"
"2","Cool. Grandkids (five and seven) love it but sometimes they talk a little too fast to be understood.","Positive"
"3","This instrument might be the greatest thing since sliced bread, but the app makes it useless.  If you are lucky, it might recognize your password for your router, but it doesn't tell you.  Then the menus are dead ends, so you have to go back, and Amazon Music is the default!  About ready yo send it back and I have had it an our.  If you have Apple devices, look at the ratings for the app!","Positive"
"4","Love it  - Did not expect to !","Positive"
"5","The Echo is awesome. I cant wait to get connected devices light lights, thermostats, etc.... this thing is great. We use it all the time and have a lot of fun with it. Its actually quite surprising how well it does in taking commands and answering questions you would not expect it could ! I understand I can even have Alexa start my car now (note I don't think all manufacturers support yet) !","Positive"
"6","I liked this product while it lasted.  It has now gone dark and is unresponsive.  I tried unplugging it and plugging it back in, but alas.  She seems dead.","Negative"
"7","I received Alexa yesterday.  I was so excited to begin using the music app......","Positive"
"8","I think I have put in over 2 hours trying to make this work.","Positive"
"9","I will try to get help but may have to send it back....sorry to say.","Negative"
"10","I've forgotten what life before Alexa was like.  I love it.  Every morning I wake up and listen to my flash news briefing.  It was changed my life for the better!  I'm excited to see what future developments hold for this product.","Positive"
"11","I purchased this mainly to listen to music but I have found myself doing SO much more with it.  It plays games, turns off lights, plays OCEAN WAVES or RAIN - THIS IS GREAT!!!!  My mother was over and is purchasing her one as we speak!","Positive"
"12","AWESOME INVENTION I USE EVERY DAY ALONG WITH THE DOTS","Positive"
"13","More amazing.  The perfect ""Christmas gift for special people.","Positive"
"14","After purchasing the Amazon Echo I became very frustrated.  I am now unhappy that everything else in my life isn't voice activated!!!  I have told everyone I know how great this product is.  Well done Amazon!","Negative"
"15","On a serious note, I have caught myself starting to speak commands to other appliances, only to catch myself and realizing I have to actually pick up the remote to control them.  How barbaric!  lol","Negative"
"16","I would have given it 5 stars except for one maddening fault. When you tell it to turn on or off a device it  ALWAYS says ""I found multiple devices with that name. Which device did you mean?"" after witch you repeat exactly what you said the first time and it does what you asked. If it at least let you repeat the device name before it finished it wouldn't be so bad, but after 100 times it still always asks for the device name again and it gets extremely frustrating!!!!","Negative"
"17","love it","Positive"
"18","I absolutely love the Echo. At first I didn't think I would use it for anything other than music but I have been using it for everything from news updates and alarms to games, podcasts and my smart devices. The sound is excellent. I've recommended this to everyone in my family.","Positive"
"19","Love Amazon Echo!  This little tower can really do so many things.  I personally love being able to turn on and off the lights with just a simple command.  My only complaint is I ordered the gift wrap as it was a gift for my husband and it was stuffed into a skin tight bag that I could not seal.  Very disappointed I spent money on wrapping it when in the end I had to wrap it myself to keep it a surprise.","Positive"
"20","Great fun for the family.  Speaker sounds decent and Alexa has smart technology so she learns. It's great to have a question and be able to ask it without grabbing your phone or computer. ""Alexa how do you spell....?"" or ""Alexa what's the weather tomorrow?""","Positive"
"21","Nothing but fun fun fun!!!!!","Positive"
"22","The best speaker Iv'e bought so far! It beats Google Home in every way as I bought both devices. The amazon echo is accurate and superb in sound! It won't let you down! Highly recommended! :)","Positive"
"23","Its amazing what it can do and its very helpful and it can tell you jokes lol","Positive"
"24","I'm also adding a battery base to it to make it portable. :)","Positive"
"25","*** The things I feel like could be added to the amazon echo would be other custom names instead of amazon, alexa and echo. Also a speakerphone for conversations such as phone calls. If these features could be added, then this would be the ultimate device! :D","Positive"
"26","Very impressed. I bought a factory refurbished unit, and it functions perfectly and looks nice.  Lots of fun.","Positive"
"27","OK, keeping this brief, because I love my Echo, though I've not explored it's abilities as much as I should be.  As I am about to buy a Tap and a Dot, I wanted to make Amazon aware of the following review, in hopes that they will investigate work to resolve the claims made in the article below...I finished it feeling as though the gentleman was paid by Google, but I also know some of his claims are valid...I hope Amazon is able to move the next step forward to continue improving a great product.","Positive"
"28","I use the echo mostly for listening to prime music and getting my daily flash news briefing. The kids have some fun asking her silly questions and to tell jokes. It gives a nice sound and can play at a loud volume without distorting the sound. It's also handy for giving weather reports and traffic updates.","Positive"
"29","Only leaving 4 instead of 5 stars due to when she's playing anything over volume 5 she doesn't respond to her name and needs to have you walk over and push her action button to get her attention. Superb sound, nice features.  Just improve her response rate and make her a little smarter for general questions and she would be a 10 rating.","Positive"
"30","Alexa is about as helpful as Siri, which is not much.  She rarely hears my requests correctly and has little capabilities beyond what my iPhone can do.","Positive"
"31","I'm not sure how I ever lived without Alexa. The echo is so useful, especially for children who haven't yet learned to read/write, tell time, etc., or elderly who have difficulty with new tech. Just set up the Echo and everyone can use it.","Negative"
"32","really struggles with language. many struggles getting espn westwood one radio tonight to listen to packer game. What is the answer?","Negative"
"33","So far so good. Still learning the proper commands and all, but def like it.","Positive"
"34","We use Alexa every day. It's fun and the kids love it.","Positive"
"35","good toy","Positive"
"36","I have only had the device for a day and am having fun with it.  I am considering returning it though because reminders are just added to a list. It is handy to be able to ask her to remind you to do a task at a certain time, but if you have to remember to check a list it defeats the purpose!  A fun little gadget, but almost useless as an assistant and maybe not worth the price.","Positive"
"37","Too much work setting up. I'd probably rarely use it.","Positive"
"38","Ordered it after reading reviews on the internet. Was not disappointed.  It does all it says it can with minimal trouble. Just wish it covered Nascar in the sports section. I would recommend it to my friends.","Negative"
"39","Fairly useful except the main thing I used it for, to play my music back randomly, didn't work. Amazon's communication about this flaw was one-sided, unclear, and not useful. I hope Amazon can fix the issue.","Negative"
"40","I love Alexa","Positive"
"41","Oh Alexa what would I ever do with out you! My hubby travels all the time for work and she's kinda like my friend ( sad I know) I tell her good morning everyday and she say Good Morning and tells me a fact for the day! She also tells me to have sweet dreams at night!","Positive"
"42"," Makes ordering way to easy! Good thing my 4 yr old has not figured out how to order but you can set up a password for orders.  She's kinda funny she's a member of our family now!","Positive"
"43","Works great. Can't for the updates that will make it more knowledgeable.","Positive"
"44","  My dog is hilarious when I have her open a box of cats! IF YOU HAVE A DOG TRY IT!!!!!! It's funny.","Positive"
"45","  Annnnnd there's a finding Dory alarm I have set every am for when my son has to get ready for school. It's a life saver he drops what he is doing and goes to brush his teeth and hair get shoes on back pack!","Positive"
"46"," Alexa is awesome!!","Positive"
"47","Still getting use to talking out loud to a machine, wife hates it. It has so many functions that you really need to search the internet to learn them and do a periodic check since they add new functions on an extremely regular basis. I use it to get a weather report and news report while making coffee. I also am now using it as a cooking timer when I have more then one item that needs timed. I am a novice user, I recommend you do a bit of research prior to ordering to see the thousands of things you can do with it and see if it will work for you. I give it 4 stores since it started playing hardcore RAP music while my mother was visiting scaring the daylights out of her and my wife since it was so late and neither one had used the ""ALEXA"" keyword to when I checked the recording on the Alexa APP to see what hard started the music. This furthermore made my wife hate it. It is fun to listen to the older commands on the APP when you are not home. I had quite a laugh listening to my wife ask Alexa how much she cost trying to learn more about it and give me grief is my guess. Alexa at least didn't tell on me!","Positive"
"48","Breathes there a man with a soul so dead,","Positive"
"49","I purchased as a gift for someone and he loves it!","Positive"
"50","The basic function of Alexa is very good, that is playing music, telling time, setting timers and such. But it seems that almost every functional thing beyond the basics requires a smart phone or Android device of the latest OS or Apple and they have to be got from third parties through Google Play or Apple.  My problem is I don't have a smart phone and my Android device isn't of the needed vintage.","Positive"
"51","I showed my wife the commercial for it right before it was released. She isn't super tech savvy and didn't really see the point. She surprised me when she got me one for our anniversary. We set it up in the kitchen and use it every. single. day. Now there is constantly music playing in our kitchen instead of having to stick a phone into a docking station.  Love that it syncs with Pandora and I honestly would never use my prime music account without it. I am notorious for not putting things I use the last of on the grocery list. Not anymore!  Kitchen timers, news briefs, the kids LOVE asking her to tell jokes. I also love that it is open sourced and constantly evolving. We use her to control our Hue lighting system and have several wemo switches now. Looking forward to adding a Nest thermostat in the near future.","Positive"
"52","I love my echo.","Positive"
"53","I used to have Alexa in the house. Then figured out that having it in the garage is much better since i can leave it up high enough and out of the way when working, and no need for a larger radio or having to use bluetooth all,the time with a smaller speaker.","Positive"
"54","I got mine when they first came out when i had to sign up to get one, as a prime member i paid 99 dollars and have never had a problem. Great device. Looking to get a few dots for around the house.","Positive"
"55","Worst thing I have ever purchased from Amazon.  It has never worked longer than one hour continuously.  Usually stays on anywhere from 5 minutes to 10 minutes than goes off line and has to be rebooted.  It did not work properly when I first took it out of the box.  After three days with three different customer service and tech people, it stayed on for almost an hour.  I have moved it three times to get it ever closer to the wifi. I have rebooted and reinstalled it at least twelve times.  I was gone for three weeks and unplugged it in my absence in the hope that it might work when I returned and that was the final move, closest to the wifi.  It has been worse.  Today in frustration, I again called customer service and spent about 30 minutes with someone that kept telling me he would fix my problem.  I finally had to ask how he was going to do that when everyone else had failed.  Turned out he was just saying it to fill time while we waited for Alexa to YET AGAIN reboot.  I was asked to go get another power source and try that.  I had to share that I have not additional power sources for Alexa nor should I have to have one.  After the reboot and the half hour and a call back 15 minutes later, Alexa managed to stay on for 20 minutes.  This is the biggest waste of money and no one at Amazon seems to know how to fix the ones, like mine, that do not work.","Negative"
"56","Love it","Positive"
"57","Awesome product a must for any home.","Positive"
"58","Grear sound, easy setup up!","Positive"
"59","Fortunately, Amazon has an app for PCs which allows me to add the book reading function by clicking on the book to be read, but it requires me to turn on the PC - which I'd have to do with all the other devices, too.  The smart phones, of course would usually be on for texting and other such time wasters.","Positive"
"60","Every time you loose internet/wifi, the echo is a beeatch to get reconnected. I have two of them and I hate the set up","Negative"
"61","time I have to kill everytime. I almost tossed both of them in the fire this morning, Next time wont be almost.","Negative"
"62","I am very happy with Amazon Echo, it works as I expected and I have found it to be great when I need to set a timer in my kitchen or ask for recipes, and ordering Items from Amazon.","Positive"
"63","Love it.  Hardly pick up my phone at home anymore and I live through my phone.  I turned my house inyo a smart home.  My girlfriend loves to leave lights on.  I can turn any light off through echo","Positive"
"64","My 73 year old parents LOVE IT!!!! Gave it to them as an early Christmas present and they use it all the time. Two of my brothers order one after seeing it! Easy to set up and use.","Positive"
"65","Ummm yes everyone needs one! Just do it...it will not disappoint.","Negative"
"66","Very useful. I like this so much I bought another. And then I bough an echo dot. and then I got my mother and my in-laws one. I should own Amazon stock.","Positive"
"67","Great product. Just as advertised.","Positive"
"68","Awesome. Bought as a gift . My husband loves this thing and the sound and operation is AWESOME. Easy connectivity.","Positive"
"69","I wish I had purchased it sooner. Definitely will purchase a few more for the relatives. It truly did it all with ease. Paired with the alexa app, it's so easy to use","Positive"
"70","Using items like smart outlets, which is what I wanted for my hospice patient wife, at the moment, is impossible because I have to create another account for the devices, and they only accept input from there app on a smart phone.  Without that, Alexa will neither find it nor operate it.","Positive"
"71","This is one of the most intuitive items I have used in a long wile. The voice UI is close to spot-on, for me better than Siri and Okay Google on my smartphones. I can even give a command from about >20 feet away in the other room. Although it seems to struggle with the volume up above six (6) hearing me from farther away making it hard to turn down the volume from the other room. I would have not only given this five stars but I would have purchased several more if they would connect giving me music throughout the home/patio. This one device playing at a time just seems like a waste of good technology.","Positive"
"72","We love it great little helper","Positive"
"73","It's just a OK device and don't get fooled by all the hypes.  The search is very awkward and too limited.  In order to find any meaningful result, you have to say wikipedia +""question"". When search a song, it also just pulls up from Amazon.  I will give Google Home a try and heard that the search is far better and natural.","Positive"
"74","I love the fact that I can speak to Alexa and add grocery lists, turn on music, etc.","Positive"
"75","I love my echo when im getting dressed in the morning it tells me the weather and then plays my favorite songs to start my day.","Positive"
"76","Bought as gift for sister.  She LOVES it, One was given to my son as a gift, he LOVES it.  So I went ahead and bought three more.  The white for my sister's BDAY, and two more(purchase limit) on Black Friday for xmas gifts!! Does too much to list, you have to see it your self. Just buy it...the guy at Best Buy told me they had a demo for Google one, and it wasn't as great. I also do not like the look of the new Google one anyway.  (FYI-- you can listen to itunes through this, just need to use it as a bluetooth speaker, and stream through it that way, can use ""Alexa Pause and Alexa skip"" with that only)","Positive"
"77","Echo comes out of the box just waiting to be amazing. You start by plugging it in, and from there you get instructions from Alexa on how to pair with your internet. Download the Echo app and you're off. So far, the voice recognition is spot on. There aren't many instances where she hasn't understood what I was asking for. If you have your music REALLY loud, sometimes you need to raise your voice to her, but she can still hear you.","Negative"
"78","Where she really shines is her integration with Spotify, Pandora and TuneIn. After linking these services, all you have to do is ask for a song or playlist from your service and she gets it for you. Her accuracy with spotify so far for me is about 80%. Sometimes she will say that she can't find a certain song, but if you get more specific with your request, she will find it. Where she starts to have trouble is with little kid voices. My kids (7,3) love using it, but she has a hard time understanding them sometimes. Once they slow down and speak clearly, it works just fine.","Positive"
"79","Overall this is an amazing gadget with a thousand uses. From music, to sports scores, to weather, to the news. She can do just about anything. Then if you have Nest, or Hue products..she can control your smart home too!","Positive"
"80","Love this. Great gift","Positive"
"81","I'll keep the Alexa,  much disappointmented, but I'll return the outlets as unusable because I am not investing in a smart phone.","Positive"
"82","My kids love it. I like the convenience of just asking it to play pandora when I sit down to do my art and not fumble with the switches when my wife yells something from the lower floor of the house.","Positive"
"83","I bought this for a Bluetooth speaker.  I have a couple of Bluetooth speakers that really aren't very loud and are hard to pair.  This is very satisfactory in both regards.  It pairs easily with my Android phone and plays at a good volume.  Yesterday I was listening to Pandora and actually had to say, ""Alexa, reduce volume."" The volume reduction was immediate and met my requirements.  I haven't used many of the features  beyond Bluetooth, but when I asked for news, I got a five minute news report from my favorite station, so that was very cool.  It is rather pricey, but so far it has been a good addition to my life.  It is portable enough to take from the kitchen to the bedroom (I got the battery base).  Next I want to try bringing it in the car.  My car will pair with my phone, but I can't use voice control to ask for my Audible book or etc.","Positive"
"84","Pros:","Positive"
"85","1. The setup and use of this device is as easy as any wifi integrated electronic equipment; easier, in fact.  The Bluetooth connect procedure is a bit trickier, but only slightly.","Positive"
"86","2. Voice recognition is superb.","Positive"
"87","3. Basic voice command functions are incredibly simple (e.g. Weather, Smarthome devices, specific music requests, volume control, etc.).","Positive"
"88","4. Aesthetically compatible in any room.","Positive"
"89","Cons:","Negative"
"90","1.  As an audiophile, I can only say that the sound quality is passable, but by no means is it on par with Bose or Klipsch minispeaker systems.  DO NOT let this put you off of the Echo.  It is not bad at all for ambient music, but it won't be your go-to for party music.  My wife uses the Echo exclusively.  She's perfectly happy with the audio quality and methods to choose what she wants to listen to.","Positive"
"91","2. When music is playing, getting Alexa to wake up is very intermittent.  Doesn't  seem to discriminate voice from music well at all.","Negative"
"92","I've decided to chuck both the smart switch and Alexa, both require too much and return too little.  One shouldn't have to have a handful of devices to make Alexa smart enough to do its duty (I refuse to humanize a barely functional machine).  I bought them to comfort my wife in hospice by playing music and reading her Kindle books, but she's gone now and the machine was no help at all - due to the ridiculous, designed in constraints that refused to even read a bought and paid for book from Amazon or turn a light on and off without first having a smart phone or the proper Android OS.","Positive"
"93","3. The folks at Amazon are always working to improve functionality, and that is a good thing.  A lot of questions we've posed simply are out of the realm and reach of the search engine's capability.  In other words, don't try a lot of AND or OR discrete searches.  This does seem to be improving, but it is currently the Achilles heel for now.","Positive"
"94","4.  Items 1-3 above are not major issues that would cost the review more than one star combined.  The fact that I cannot connect the output from the Echo to my Bluetooth audio receiver, however, is a full star deduction.  Seems intuitive that the unit should have both transmit and receive functions at this price point.","Positive"
"95","All of this said, I really like the Echo for what it is.  I would recommend this as a great gift for that person on your gift list who is not a discerning audio snob and who is someone that appreciates the simplicity of a true plug and play device.","Positive"
"96","Amazing.","Positive"
"97","Love Echo.  Cool item to build your lifestyle around overall.  Now, Amazon just need to sync to youtube","Positive"
"98","Amazing device.  My wife and I are enjoying learning all Alexa can do","Positive"
"99","I have a love-hate relationship with Alexa.","Positive"
"100","The product itself is superb and even better that it was a refurb.","Positive"
"101","The concept of Alexa is fantastic but it's execution is lacking and still very much in the infant stage.","Negative"
"102","We love it!! Just got it today and Alexa is playing all our request. Very happy so far","Positive"
"103","I purchased an Echo about 6 months ago. As with any tech purchase I was very excited to receive my new echo but the excitement was short lived. I have a speech impairment so I expected with any voice recognition software to have to learn my speech pattern; I thought there would be a paragraph that a person has to read 3 or 4 times for the software to learn your speech pattern, but there wasn't. There isn't any set-up for the voice recognition software so it just arbitrarily dismissed me.","Positive"
"104","Rarely do I need Alexa to tell me a joke or a specific one-liner.","Positive"
"105","I want to ask Alexa complex questions and have her find me the answer or have a dialogue with me to find what I'm looking for.","Negative"
"106","Her ability to read Wikipedia is lacking.","Negative"
"107","I want something as simple as telling Alexa to remember my birthday and store it in her database of useful facts for me.  I want to tell her the birthday of my wife and to record that she likes a certain type of flowers.  Then as it gets closer, I want to ask Alexa if she has any deals for me relating to birthday gifts for my wife and I want Alexa to offer to buy flowers for my wife.  That's what a personal assistant does.","Positive"
"108","Alexa is still so lacking in the ""if this, then that"" field.  The bright side?  She plays music and emails my wife recipes from the Food Channel.","Negative"
"109","Love love it!","Positive"
"110","I absolutely love my Amazon Echo. From Music to sports updates to my audible books to the alarm.  I deliberated for 3 months or more on whether I thought it would be worth the price.  I got a black Friday deal, but would even buy it over again at full price.  I love Alexa!","Positive"
"111","Love Echo.  Does everything as promised.","Positive"
"112","Siri has a small amount of personality , this does not. Other than playing music and giving you the weather this is a dumb piece of","Positive"
"113","And since it was past the time limit to return I now have a $139 paperweight. Thanks Amazon","Negative"
"114","I love this item!!! Would buy it again ;-)","Positive"
"115","If you are thinking about buying just do it. It took 30 minutes for me to fall in love with this. The speaker is amazing for music, Alexa has so many features, and I am excited for more things to be added. I look forward to using this over the next months.","Positive"
"116","Easily one of my favorite tech purchases EVER and I just bought two more. The voice recognition and command system is far beyond anything Apple or Google has put forward. Nearly all the house guests who have witnessed us nonchalantly telling Alexa to turn the music down, play a specific song, or ask a general question are in awe and almost immediately commit to buying one themselves.","Positive"
"117","did not work with my router spent hours with support to try and fix. They could not fix it.","Positive"
"118","Well.. it's alright device. I'm considering returning it and then 4 Dots I have simply because I have to return and rebuy the echo to get $40 back. I even said I'd take Amazon credit was told only $20. Once I was escalated, the manager said that by taking to him the $20 gift card offer was no longer valid and told me I was out of luck and go ahead and return.","Positive"
"119","Really want to see a better search feature.","Positive"
"120","I bought this thing in Feb 2015, never even bothered to plug it in until November 2015 when it became compatible with my Smartthings Hub. I used it a few times a day for random things (music, alarms, weather, etc). At the beginning of November 2016 it worked fine one day in the morning and later that night it was dead. No lights, no response, nothing. Amazon sent me a replacement ac adapter because apparently their early models were shipped with defective adapters. Still didn't work. Tech support said it was out of warranty but they could offer me a ""special"" price to replace it. That price was the same price listed on the website for everyone to purchase. How was this ""special""?","Positive"
"121","The echo was great when it worked, but I'd expect it to last longer than a year of use. I won't be buying a replacement... especially at the ""special"" price.","Positive"
"122","I really like my White Amazon Echo, it sounds great, it looks great, and it seems to have a really nice solid high quality build with really nice buttons and the top turns with a satisfying amount of resistance. I took down 1 Star because a lot of the questions I ask, it doesn't know the answer to, but I think that will be fixed over time as more and mor epeople use the service. I would definitely would recommend this to a family member or a friend. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!","Positive"
"123","Great product","Positive"
"124","It's okay but doesn't understand many questions asked of it. Unfortunately it died after seven months.","Negative"
"125","Our new best friend Alexa is as fun to have around while she's being so darn handy. From music to weather and scores and recipes. Haven't tried any others like this in the market so I can't compare her to the google one but I can say she's better than Siri. Understands me and my boyfriend easily and goes well with the app.","Positive"
"126","work like a charm easy install and reponds great to commands","Positive"
"127","I freaking LOVE this thing. Now to get a couple Dots to go with it.","Positive"
"128","We've loved our echo ever since we've gotten it.","Positive"
"129","We are having a lot of fun with it.  Our son set it up for us.","Positive"
"130","I love Alexa my only issue is I can't remember what each launch fraize to use for what skill.....how is this resolved....I have stop and look on the app.....kinda defeats the purpose....????  Maybe in the future she will be more adaptable to questions kinda like google is.....  I have to say I do plan on purchasing the Dot to put in my bedroom.  There has been so many times this past year I wanted to add to my shopping list or to do list or play this etc... and  I found myself say Alexa...but she is in the living room and can't hear me....LOL","Positive"
"131","Good for music and simple questions.","Positive"
"132","The Iphone Ap didn't contact or set the Alexa up correctly.  Difficult interface made it too much trouble to use.","Negative"
"133","Amazing device!!! I love it!","Positive"
"134","Per my boyfriend, ""Alexa is my new girlfriend."" We have yet to tap into all her utility, but so far she's been a great companion to friend's child by answering questions, my boyfriend and me by settling arguments via fact checking, picking playlists based on what I announce my mood to be, and informing me of the weather as I am rushing around in the morning getting ready for work. I can't wait to work through all other functions.","Positive"
"135","Best purchase I made all year!","Positive"
"136","I purchased an Echo when it was only available to Prime Members.  It has improved over the years to a fully functional assistant.  I use it so much, I purchased a second one for my office.  I always think I am going to remember something but then I don't.  Why don't I just use Outlook to organize?  Because it just seems like so much work and sticky notes just get gone.  I just add a reminder to my to do list or calendar and let Alexa take care of the rest.  I don't use my Echo to its full potential but she keeps my calendar, reminders, grocery list.  She impresses co-workers with her ability to answer a question pretty efficiently.  She turns the lights out when I'm to lazy to get up and turns them on when I leave during the day and get back after dark.  She reads to me from my Audible account.  I use her to place orders.  Okay, I am a little lazy, Echo just makes it less obvious to others.","Positive"
"137","What can I say that hasn't been said about the Amazon Echo. It is an awesome product, I use it in everyday life from playing music to controlling my smart home devices in my home. I even won over my wife and she loves it. The seven microphones can pick up my voice across my entire home. Its tied directly into my home automation system and combine with IFTTT the possibilities are endless.","Positive"
"138","Great Product 5 Stars","Positive"
"139","Love this product!! So many uses and always coming out with new things you can use it for. I started out with just the Eco and now have 5 or 6 different lights amd other items I can control through it. I recommend getting Amazon Prime and it opens up a whole new side of the Eco.","Positive"
"140","I have both a dot and an echo and they are just fantastic. Its creepy awesome how you can just a question out of rhe blue or have a song in your head and within seconds Alexa is there. The Exho has a full sound it doesnt take up space Its crazy awesome","Positive"
"141","I just received my Echo today and I already am in love, 5 stars for one of the most interesting technical parts of my life. It plays your music, it can read you books. It answers any question at all you have for it. It  will update you on all your favorite sports teams. It sets alarms and timers for you. It will add things to your shopping list as you think of it. It will add things to your calendar as you think of it. It even can operate things in your home like your smart thermostat or the lights in your home. There isn't much it cannot do. She is awesome!!","Positive"
"142","I love Alexa and I'm very happy with the Echo.  I do wish it was wireless though","Positive"
"143","I got my Echo today, and it's safe to say that I'm in love. For starters, Alexa is a Monty Python fan, because when I asked her, ""What's the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?"" ... well, she knew the right answer. She plays my favorite music, even making suggestions that are dead on. She knows the time, the weather, celsius to fahrenheit conversions ... and she'll wake me up from a nap, take dictation (shopping list and to-do list), keep track of my calendar, adjust my Nest thermostat and my Phillips Hue lights, and order me a pizza. She'll also bark at my dog (on command) and play music from my iPhone via Bluetooth.","Positive"
"144","Bought this one for a neighbour because we were so impressed with ours.","Positive"
"145","And that brings me to the sound from this smaller-than-expected device: It's unbelievable. I have AudioEngine bookshelf speakers that are pretty darned good, but the Echo shames them. What a robust sound! I'm seriously blown away.","Positive"
"146","So, yeah, get thee an Echo. You won't be disappointed.","Negative"
"147","AMAZON CUSTOMER SERICE is HORRIBLE!  I have speaking to a customer service rep for over 30 minutes and he seems clueless as to how to help me with what should be a relatively easy inquiry.  I bought an AMAZON ECHO as a gift last week and noticed that it went on sale days after my purchase and I called to ask if they could provide a credit for the $40.00 difference.  I was told by the young man ( who had difficulty communicating ) that it would be best if I returned the one purchased and buy it again with the sale price.  REALLY it was a gift and I am not willing to ask the recipient of the gift to give it back.  What?  C'mon Amazon I am a Prime Member and this is the best solution you got?  By the way I am still on hold while he tries to find his supervisor.  It is now over 45 minutes...50 MINUTES AND COUNTING...NOW over an hour...UNACCEPTABLE","Positive"
"148","I enjoy the Echo but you put it on sale 5 days after I bought it.  As a Prime member I wish I had been made aware of this.  Disappointed in Amazon.","Positive"
"149","This thing is pretty neat. It comes in handy turns off my lights. My favorite thing that it does it's turns on my bathroom heater in the morning not having to go into a cold bathroom first thing in the morning is priceless.","Positive"
"150","I have now tried twice to have Amazon replace this defective unit (it repeatedly goes mute - no sound output at all), and twice the customer service reps have said something to the effect of, ""Reset the device, and I'll call you back tomorrow to see how things are."" Amazon never calls back, and my device is still defective. The second CSR even acknowledged that the first CSR should have called back, since they have record of the first call in their files. Then, he left me hanging just like the first.","Negative"
"151","I'd love to 5-star this, but customer service has left a bad taste in my mouth. If you get a working unit, good for you. If you've got a defective one like me, good luck.","Positive"
"152","I wish I hadn't purchased this. The only thing Alexa seems to do for us is tell a joke or the weather. Half the time she doesn't understand what we're asking or refers us to the app. I added things on the app and she still doesn't recognize what I'm asking. I don't know what people use this for other than smart home devices which we don't currently have.","Positive"
"153","got it with the 5 payment option...good product","Positive"
"154","Love the amazon echo. Family is already enjoying it.","Positive"
"155","Enjoy learning with it!","Positive"
"156","Love it... Will order another for my downstairs.","Positive"
"157","I wish Alexa had a little bit more AI and be more conversational.  The skills are great but I sometimes forget the ""catch phrase"".  I also hope there are more settings for traffic report for work.  I use non toll roads and Alexa only gives me fastest route.  Otherwise, I find Alexa to be an eye opener to making my home smart.","Positive"
"158","I've only had it one day and already love it! This morning I checked my calendar, weather, set an alarm, listened to jokes, made a to-do list, a shopping list, and listened to my favorite music all through simple voice commands! (and with out leaving my cozy bed LOL!!!!) Only complaint is that I had to order a battery pack separate or you need to have it plugged in 24/7. Also, I have not learned all the features yet, but once this connects to your phone (text, read emails, and make calls) everyone will want one!","Positive"
"159","OMG... how did we get along without Alexa? She is so helpful (and at times so funny). She tells us the weather for the day and the week ahead. She answers questions that frequently pop into our heads (i.e. Alexa, when did So-and-So die? Alexa, what is the capital city of ....?). She orders items from Amazon when we realize we need a replacement. She plays our Prime music for us and her speakers are great. She gives us information on restaurants, etc. She even says good-night to us... haha. She'll sing, tell jokes and give us the news of the day in our Flash Briefing. I cannot imagine life without our Echo. Recently we bought the Dot to go in our family room downstairs... that's how much we love these devices.","Positive"
"160","i can't say anything about this as of yet because it is for a christmas gift. i know my son has one and enjoys it so i am hoping my husband will enjoy it when he gets it.","Positive"
"161","Wonderful item. She can be stubborn sometimes. Or maybe I don't say it correctly-LOL!! We get along pretty well though. I'm liking the Christmas music she plays. And the jokes are fun for my grandkids. This is a very clever thing and I enjoy Alexa alot.","Positive"
"162","Well, I thought that it would speak to me when I need it to remind me of appointments!  I guess I really don't know how to use it, & need some structural advice by a real person!  I purchased it so that it could help my husband who had several strokes by reminding him of thing of importance!  Clearly I need help learning how to operate this wonderful gadget!","Positive"
"163","You can ask it almost anything, sounds great","Positive"
"164","Arrived really fast, was going to gift it to myself for Christmas but I couldn't resist. Easy set up, Alexa picks up your voice easily and the speaker sounds really nice. Only downfall would be the app, it often crashes and I find myself having to close it and reopen it just to change a song on my phone sometimes, it doesn't affect the device one bit as you can easily do that with voice control, but just thought that I'd mention that. Other than that, I love my Echo!","Positive"
"165","Love Amazon White","Positive"
"166","Absolutely adorable and very soft and cuddly. Very very happy with this purchase.","Positive"
"167","With so many wonderful reviews, we thought we'd give this a try. We were disappointed in that it ended up sitting idle most of the time. It would be great for a single person but we found it lacking for a family with kids.","Positive"
"168","We got Echo primarily to listen to music. We got the 30 day unlimited trial but:","Positive"
"169","2) When she understood us, she often came up with a cover version of the song and not the most popular version. You have to know both the name of the song and the artist to get the song you want.","Positive"
"170","3) If you ask to play music by an artist, she plays all the songs randomly, regardless of popularity. So you hear a lot of what you don't want to hear.","Negative"
"171","4) There is no way to get just the clean versions of the songs. Too many songs popular on the radio have explicit versions as their album versions and that is what you'll get. This alone was a non-starter for us.","Positive"
"172","We have a WeMo controlled light, and that was fun to turn on by voice, but not convenient enough to get the Echo for. Granted if we have more, it might have been more valuable. We were debating to get more WeMo/Philips Hue but decided it was more of a gimmick and often confusing to those who just wanted to turn lights on by the switch.","Positive"
"173","The games for our kids were awful. We tried 20 questions and an animal game and a few math games. The interaction is awkward as Alexa is always in a rush and the whole household has to be quiet or she'll interpret the noise as an answer and move on. With two kids, one just has to be very quiet so one's answer doesn't mess up the other's game. She was equally terrible with the few math games we tried as she'd often not hear the correct answer correctly, tell the kid they were wrong, and then the kid's confused as to what the right answer is as they can't figure out what the right answer is (given they were just told the right answer was wrong.)","Positive"
"174","Lot of fun @ informative","Positive"
"175","Alexa is not conversational. If you ask her something, you have to repeat it in any follow up. For example, we asked if the library was open and she (incredibly!) told us the right answer. You can't just say ""Alexa, how do we get there"" as she won't know what there is. We'd have to say ""Alexa, give us directions to the Anytown USA Library"".","Positive"
"176","Overall we found this not very useful and the fun things were more than offset by the frustrating things. I'm thinking of getting a DOT as it is most of the functionality for a fraction of the cost, so maybe it could be worth it (just to turn on the lights, say, and to have some access to the Echo deals) but we are returning our Echo","Positive"
"177","This echo needs wifi to work and needs to be plugged in at all times. It may also connect to a phone through bluetooth for general audio but the true features come through syncing your devices' apps to the echo through wifi. AleXA sets my alarms and is a good listener. I don't have wifi outlets yet to use her to turn my home appliances and lights on or off but I might buy some once the technology gets better for those plugs. I'm happy with alexa and she can be very hilarious to chat with aND ask questions to.  Sometimes I have to yell at her to be quiet cuz no one was talking to her and she's giving random history facts but that only happened one really convenient (funny) time in a conversation with my husband.","Positive"
"178","Wish it was as cool as UE boom/megaboom but it doesn't have the durability or portableness. Very stationary,  find an open spot in your home, don't put her on a book case, she needs to be able to pick up the voice from 360 degrees around.","Positive"
"179","Echo has cool sound and I love having it all the way up in my apartment during the day. Shakes the ground so keep it at volume 6 or less for nightime use out of respect for apartment peeps. 7 or higher when you're home alone or during the day, no one will mind as much. Great for music lovers who like to dance to a heavy beat or sing along loudly!!","Positive"
"180","I wish alexa could find a lost phone in the house by either pinpointing the wifi signal or telling her,  verbally where you're moving the phone?","Negative"
"181","Alexa is an absolute must have! My children and I are very impressed with this product. I wake up to the children asking ""Alexa what is...?"" Or ""Alexa, how do I...?"", ""Alex, play a game"",  ""Alexa, tell me a joke"", ""Alexa, set an alarm"",  ""Alexa, play music.""  This is only the tip of the iceberg of what Echo is capable of. She can read you books and when linked to other devices, she can turn on and off devices. The speaker system on this is impressive, and I absolutely recommend the Echo.","Positive"
"182","  My children love it so much, that I am getting the Dots for their rooms. They don't need the loud speaker that the Echo provides for their rooms. With the Dot, they will be able to enjoy the other functions of their very own Alexa in their own rooms. Such a fun gift and learning tool for  children. They are 10 and 13 and have no shortage of questions. LOL","Positive"
"183","Loving this device so far! it as exceeded my exceptions by far! so happy with it! way worth the investment.","Positive"
"184","This Speaker and its uses are endless, great product","Positive"
"185","good product, I do have some questions about privacy in regards to this device. I would think Amazon would advise purchasers of this product about the privacy issues.","Negative"
"186","Not great outside of the US.  Doesn't use GPS so you need a zip code.  None available in HK so the use of the device is limited.  In the US this thing must be great!","Positive"
"187","Good speaker. Very sleek look. She has room to","Positive"
"188","improve as far as doing what you ask but I'm sure that will get better the more she is used and with updates.","Positive"
"189","Alexa, I love you!!  She is wonderful!  She makes our shopping list, plays Christmas music, tells us the score of the Eagles game,  orders items off Amazon, tells us if we need our umbrella,  tells us the best route to our destination and even does the dishes!  OK we haven't taught Alexa that yet but we're getting there!!  We love her and put Dots all over the house in the bedrooms!!  Falling asleep with Alexa is wonderful, she even wakes us up in the morning!  We love you Alexa xxxooo","Positive"
"190","I didn't realize what I was buying when I bought it. I just wanted a Bluetooth speaker, but it's WAY more! Alexa is almost like having an assistant in my kitchen! I can look up over temperature million songs with my amazon music. I just ask and it plays. This thing is great.One note: you have to keep this item plugged in or purchase the base for portability at almost $50.00.","Positive"
"191","LOVE IT!!!!!!!","Positive"
"192","I have an Echo Dot and bought the Big Echo because of the sea price and also I needed built in sound.. the Echo has fabulous sound!!  I play a variety of music from Country to Smooth jazz and this echo has fantastic sound!  I set it up in my living room and it it fills the Kitchen and dining room with beautiful sound.. thats about 950sq/ft.. if you have high ceilings and more than 1000 sq ft.. then you may need a higher powered speaker system.  If you already have a good system that can connect with Bluetooth then thats the way to go.. I love the sound quality.. I listened to many BT speakers to see if there was another that I would like better.. reality is.. for the money the Echo is fantastic!!  If the echo isn't enough then you need to connect to a high end stereo or Home theater system.  I have a 7.1 sound bar for my 4k TV and the Echo sounds better alone than when I connect it to play through the sound bar..  It wont get as loud as my 700 watt system  but the quality is better from the internal speakers.. If I have a party then I will go for the higher volume in on the sound bar.. but let me tell you.. I listened to Sonos..he JBL the BOSE... and it only the BOSE came close to the built in sound quality of the echo!  I would have to spend another $200 to get just a little better than what echo delivers!  Try it for yourself!  You can always return it.. I doubt you will !!  I am giving this as a gift to all my friends for Christmas.. they will love it.. I will get one for my office as well..  I hope they keep expanding the capabilities !!","Positive"
"193","LOVE THIS!!! My new best friend!!!","Positive"
"194","Even when using in Russia echo feels incredible and amazes all my friends. Hope to get support of more services in future.","Positive"
"195","Awesome!  Love it!","Positive"
"196","Awesome !!!! I'll trade in Siri for another Alexa any day! Love it!","Positive"
"197","Awesome!  Quite the toy/tool just wonder how long it keeps our interest....only time will tell.  I bought the Dot also - in hind sight the Dot might have been all I needed - could have saved $100.","Positive"
"198","This speaker has awesome sound and bass for listening to music!! I Love listening to my pandora on it!!! It also tells u the weather, news, and answers question u might have. Definitely worth the money!!! I Love it!!","Positive"
"199","Alexa is the best","Positive"
"200","I LOVE Alexa! I am amazed at how many different things you can do. From listening to music to setting timers while cooking, Alexa is simply AMAZING.","Positive"
"201","The most useless piece of equipment ever... it also has a terrible speaker... garbage lame and amateur","Negative"
"202","All I can say is I love It.  Very easy to setup have connected it to both WeMo devices and GE bulbs through wink hub.  Many extra features such as playing any music from my Amazon prime membership.","Positive"
"203","You know what would be great?  If the Echo was wireless.  You don't specifically mention this in the product description.  If a device can turn off my tv/lights, you'd definitely think it would be wireless too.  That seems like a huge missed opportunity Amazon.  I'm an Amazon employee too, but again, huge missed opportunity.","Positive"
"204","Purchased the Echo for my husband. It was originally supposed to be a Christmas gift but I'm terrible at keeping secrets. Plus my husband frequently checks my account, so I was worried he would see it and the surprise would be ruined.","Negative"
"205","Shipping was fast, nothing less than what we've all come to expect from Amazon. The packaging was easy to open. Set up was effortless. I love the emails that Amazon sent regarding set up and the different features that the Echo provides. It does a lot more than I ever thought it could.","Positive"
"206","Very unhappy with this item.  Most of the time it just does not work!  I ask for it to play music and it goes silent.  It rarely responds to my husband, or guest or me. But the strange thing it occasionally will respond to some question on the television. Odd!  I would not recommend for purchase as a waste of money.","Negative"
"207","I am pleased with it but I just wish I didn't have to get an app for most everything.","Positive"
"208","Easy Set Up","Positive"
"209","User Friendly","Positive"
"210","The only one I can come up with is that the Echo does not work with apple music. I'm sure Apple is a direct competitor, but that's where I keep my music.","Positive"
"211","AM a little disappointed with this , want to love but its uses are limited, I drops wifi signals sometimes and works with my automated lighting when it wants to,  the only uses to me are weather, tell me some jokes, can't see all the positive reviews, I guess  just a lot of lonely folks out there. Just not worth 179.00 just an over hyped gadget in my honest opinion!!","Positive"
"212","I have one of these (which I ordered from another site that was offering them at a lower cost at the time) and one echo dot.  I keep this one in my bedroom and mainly use it to play music, since it has a better speaker than the dot.  It is not high end Bose quality, but much better in quality than old school low end computer speakers, and some bluetooth speakers.","Positive"
"213","This is (in my opinion) very handy, and has more and more functionality being added all the time. The echo can do anything from playing music from Pandora, iHeart, Amazon music etc, to updating a grocery list, turning lights on and off, ordering a pizza, accessing Wikepedia, getting weather and traffic updates etc.","Positive"
"214","I see them as being as useful as you want them to be. Some of the skills that can be enabled are pretty useless or just for fun, but others like the alert my buddy app (which can alert a list of people if you need help, which can be great for seniors) can be very useful. I have found that it responds to and understands commands most of the time very well. It mainly only has problems when there is background noise like from a TV.  Although it occasionally understands a question but does not know the answer.  You can give it feedback through the app which you have to download to a phone or tablet to get it set up, by telling it whether the unit did what you wanted next to what it heard.","Positive"
"215","Though I'm amazed & impressed by the technology -- the speaker has a rattle in it, as though it's blown! I've tried various things -- placing it on a cushion surface (like a mouse pad), which helps some -- but a new product / speaker shouldn't have a rattle. Anyone else having similar issues?","Positive"
"216","The setup is very easy, just plugging it in, connecting it to wifi via the app and then reading off a list of 25 commands so it can configure to your voice.  It is definitely not something that everyone will find useful or see as a must have, but if you have seen the commercials or looked into it and are intrigued by at least some of the things it can do then I definitely think it (especially at the reduced holiday price) is worth the expense.  Even if you are looking for a reasonably priced bluetooth speaker this will give you that functionality and a lot more.","Positive"
"217","Love the amazon echo. everyone needs one for their house. Would recommend to friend and family","Positive"
"218","If you like to listen to music Alexa is a must have product.  I just bought it out of curiosity but I use it often for the weather and to play music.  You can tell her to play country music and she will play top country station or whatever type of music you want.  She will also play specific songs.  We have 2 parakeets that like to hear the Green Acres theme song.  Where else can you get that just by asking?  Nowhere!  It will also do many other things and Amazon is constantly adding to what the Echo can do with updates.  My Mom who is in her late 60's and will not even get a smart phone thought Alexa was Amazing!  So I may get her one for Christmas.  You must have WIFI in your house but I imagine most people these days do.","Positive"
"219","Alexa is amazing!","Positive"
"220","this is a christmas gift I need and extension on the return date to JANUARY 30th or I will have to return it.  They may not need it I have ordered 3","Positive"
"221","Easy to install, voice command music is really nice. Time to get rid of conventional stereo system","Positive"
"222","Purchased one as a family xmas gift. We have a prime account so my wife and son love being able to play tons of music easily. I like some of the simple commands when I have my hands full and want to know the time, or weather real quick in the morning.","Positive"
"223","Reordering is also a plus and pretty simple. Only have run into a few command issues where I've had to repeat myself or it couldn't understand.","Positive"
"224","Currently the Alexa app for managing it is garbage as of the last update and is pretty unusable. I had to set it up using my laptop and the web based setup. This review doesn't account for that.","Negative"
"225","worst electronic I ever bought it never understands the question or can never find the answer very very disappointed","Negative"
"226","After the first day excitement, no one at our house calls Alexa anymore. You have to buy music from Amazon for Alexa to play which I don't have many.","Positive"
"227","Alexa is becoming my new best friend!  I got this for Christmas last year, and since then there has been a lot of functionality added.  I can order from Amazon, order pizza, play music, get news briefs, and a whole lot more!  I look forward using this a lot more in the future.","Positive"
"228","I love my Echo and I received it only a month ago. I took it to my Son's house for thanksgiving and she played while everyone danced. I know my Echo will do many more things I just haven't got there yet. I bought the smaller edition for my grans and one small one for my son in Illinois.","Positive"
"229","Alexa is fantastic and is an integral part of our family now. I own three :)","Positive"
"230","Awesome!!!!","Positive"
"231","I have only had my Echo a few days but I really like it. I haven't tried everything out yet. If anything changes I will change my review.","Positive"
"232","I just wanted to play music without the hassle of changing CDs.  Just tell Alexa to play xxxxx and she shuffles the music and it plays for hours.  Easy to turn into a white noise machine with your own background sounds.  Get the weather and most questions answered.  Really easy to set up.","Positive"
"233","Ok, I didn't believe the hype of the commercials about the Echo and all it did, so I didn't rush out to buy it...my mistake.  Where do I began, the sound is so pure from this device, I was like, you hear ever note: my jaw dropped, when it first played the jazz selection, I requested.  The set up is so simple, if you mess it up, you just weren't following directions at all. I opted for the white, which looks great because i didn't want to be wiping dust everyday.  Now to get the Echo Dot","Negative"
"234","What a clear sound; and the voice recognition is very good. FUN!","Positive"
"235","Purchased this product because it seemed like the latest and greatest hype.  AND BOY IS IT EVER!!!!  It's literally fantastic.  It has increased my overall daily productivity ten fold.  Sounds fairly good, not for the audiophile, but for everything it does, the sound quality is A-OK.  Sings happy birthday in probably the most soothing voice imaginable.  Truly fantastic.  Use it every day.","Positive"
"236","Lot's of fun We enjoy using it.","Positive"
"237","Loves the Echo. However, notices that Alexa ignores me at times. Other times she cannot hear you over the music. I would say though that I am really happy with my purchase. I purchased the $3.99 unlimited music from Amazon and she has found all my music request, even the weird ones. Speaker sound is great although I would have loved more base.","Positive"
"238","Really nice product. Great sound. Very easy to setup . Wifi connection seems to be strong, even at long ranges.","Positive"
"239","What a great multi-tasker. I really enjoy the benefits of the Echo. I especially like the access to Amazon music","Positive"
"240","This is a good protect, but it still needs a lot of work.","Positive"
"241","It will understand the basic questions and items like Nest or other wireless items ti turn on or off. But when it comes to questions like what you could ask Siri, it doesn't come close.","Positive"
"242","I would expect more Amazon but they are getting there s;slowly but surely.","Negative"
"243","Love it! Young Grandkids love it! It helped our 3 year old granddaughter with pronunciation! She was determined to pronounce Alexa properly so Alexa would respond and play her favorite songs!!! It's Just purchased the third one, makes great gifts!!","Positive"
"244","I have Owned Amazon Echo for Six weeks. I am Totally impressed with ALL she can do. I do have a Amazon Prime account, which makes this a better bonus to own. Actually, If I did not have a Amazon Prime account, I still would of bought a Amazon Echo . This product is a blessing in My household. I would like to bring up that you do need to have ""WiFi with her. She has a alarm ,she has a Timer, she has a shopping list, a To- do list. Not to mention all the Apps you can add to your Alexa Amazon Account If you choose to do so. There is always something new that she can do and she will tell you. All you have to do is ask her..""Alexa, what can you do?"" She can do Math questions Tell you the weather anywhere in the US, she can give you the time,you can ask her to activate her night light, of which is on for 3 minutes, if you choose. The Endless possibilities of Amazon Alexa ! We also own the Amazon voice TV stick. OMG.. Alexa is on that as well.!!! Oh what fun we have playing the ""20 questions game with Alexa. You do have the option of calling her Echo or Amazon or her Famous name Alexa when you speak to her. Just activate that name on your Amazon Alexa account. We also enjoy a joke of the day. She is amusing! She is a great learning tool for children/Young adults. I would say this Amazon product is a great gift at any time of the year. You can also link a calendar to her (Google. Outlook etc..) she will let you know what events you have scheduled.""(Alexa, what events do I have scheduled this week?)"" And she will tell you. I also purchased a dimming smart light. It works (Links) with Alexa. So when I get home from work, I say "":Alexa, turn on the living room lamp""  and the light turns on!  What a Beautiful thing :) Since this Alexa is only 2 years old, She is still learning from her owners. The more you talk to her, the more she knows and learns. She has plenty of potential. In my Eyes, She is the neatest thing I own, that keeps me Smiling.  Thank you Amazon For this great Product!!!","Positive"
"245","Bought it to use in Canada... difficult to set up and has been lagging","Negative"
"246","Great My daughter love it!! so I got one for myself...","Positive"
"247","Love Alexa!","Positive"
"248","I LOVE my Echo!  Great speaker for music and so much fun to ask questions and get the answers right away.","Positive"
"249","She gets better every day","Positive"
"250","I purchased it on Amazon thinking it would be cool for my condo. Being a jazz lover and modern contemporary type I thought it would sit great on table in living room. The problem is the damn thing never works. I have two different wifi networks and it can never connect! When she plays music it is always cutting out! It has become very frustrating, I would have done better buying a 25 dollars Bluetooth speaker to do what this $179 piece of crap is doing.. do not buy this product you will be very unhappy with it, not worth the hype!","Positive"
"251","I read a comparison between Amazon's IP-connected, AI-assisted Echo speaker and Google's whatever copycat thing they call it. The review said that the luminescence ring on the top of Echo was off-putting to some people when the multi-directional microphones hear the wake word ""Alexa"", and the ring lights up and snaps to attention focused towards the direction of your voice. I find that delightful as it reminds me of my beloved childhood dog  Jodie snapping to attention when I uttered our ""wake word""; ""Wanna go for a walk ?""","Positive"
"252","Ordered this 11/ 24 / 2016..This item stopped working one day ""after"" the warranty expired..11/ 25 / /2016....One year to the day..How nice..Can't even get it repaired anywhere..","Negative"
"253","I use Siri heavily (to annotate text messages, to find places around me etc). I wasn't convinced if an Echo would be useful. Amazon had a sale, so I bought one to give it a try.","Positive"
"254","Almost 99% of skills I've used have been useless. I find myself using the basic things that Amazon has included within it. For music, it's great! It's a great speaker that has intelligence built in...so it's a perfect music player. I've integrated it with Spotify. It's able to read all my playlists. It works great and always manages to understand what track/artist I'm looking for. It doesn't do well with music that's not Western music...so, just beware that you can't have it look for tracks or artists that don't have western names. It may work sometimes, I guess. The speaker is actually really good. It's no Bose, but it is very good. It's not tinny, it's got some decent bass, which works well with music or talk.","Positive"
"255","As a bluetooth speaker, I use it a lot to connect it to devices that have media that I want to play on the device. It's very cool to be able to just say ""Connect to blah blah blah"" and it finds and connects to that device. This bluetooth feature works well for those who have a large library of something like music or talk shows or anything audio on a bluetooth enabled device that you want on a bigger speaker.","Positive"
"256","My wife and I have two and we love them","Positive"
"257","I also use it for news. It's surprisingly convenient to get your flash briefing as you are getting ready for work and know what's going on in the world in 5 minutes.","Positive"
"258","Some of the surprisingly useful use cases I've found are: using it to set a Timer (for cooking), using it as a clock, a weather-knower-thing and a basic dictionary, for times when you encounter that WORD that you wish you knew...you can simply yell ""ALEXAAAA!!!! WHAT'S SUPERFAGELISTI....err"".","Positive"
"259","One of the most amazing features (and yes, it is a feature) is it's VOICE. I thought Siri was a good voice until I heard Alexa. It's way more human sounding. Google Home sounds bad compared to Alexa, hands down. If Google's voice was on Par with Alexa, then I would switch to Google Home in a heartbeat...as that is a much more capable device. Alexa does some things really great, Google Home will do a lot more things great; however, saying ""ok google"" over and over again will annoy the hell out of me. I have no clue why Google can't figure out a simple thing: put some PERSONALITY behind your product so that people can latch onto it. Amazon has created the Alexa voice to be very human. I know the speech rendering technologies are probably very different...but as an end user, I don't care. Google Home will eventually have a great voice (as I saw in their latest show-and-tell. So, until Google Home's voice sounds like crap and you can't change the hotword ""ok  google"" to something, anything else! I'll stick to Alexa","Positive"
"260","Bottom line: For what Alexa does out of the box, it does it well. Skills are complete duds. If MUSIC or some type of audible media (such as books etc) is not your main use for this device, then you may want to consider twice before buying. Meaning, don't buy this to turn lights on and off...get off your butt and turn the lights on/off :/","Positive"
"261","Really enjoying the PA. And it's getting smarter.","Positive"
"262","Love love my Alexa!","Positive"
"263","Love the shopping list and ease of use of my Philip Hue lights using Alexa.. You have to train Alexa but she is also training you.  I love the neat shopping list that she produces form my voice commands to her, I then open the Alexa app in the grocery store and never forget an item.  I can tell Alexa to play anything in my prime including favorite artist and she will shuffle the hits.  I can say Alexa play upbeat R&B and she will play songs I have not thought about in a while.  Was so impressed with her my husband wanted a dot for the upstairs.  I can reorder thru amazon with no fuss and place new orders you have to work a little at this one but it does work.  Well worth the money.","Positive"
"264","Pretty amazing device which only gets better. Besides the info that's available for the asking my favorite feature is the ""smart home"" angle. I've also purchased a Dot to compliment the Echo and all has integrated well with the Wink hub. If you're into tech this device is a must have.","Positive"
"265","Alexa was looking at me in a funny way. She does not give out much in the way of personal information. I am wondering if she is plotting against me?","Negative"
"266","I think Alexa treats my wife better than she treats me.","Positive"
"267","So far I'm not too impressed with it. I was expecting it to do much more. They are adding more to the program so that's a plus. Just don't think you can ask Alexa any question and you're going to get an answer other than , hmm, I can't find the answer to the question I just heard. Needs lots of work.","Positive"
"268","Works great. Love it.","Positive"
"269","I love Alexa! Makes my life easier and more intergrated. Some people will get lazy but others (like me) will take advantage of the efficiency and integrate it into a more productive lifestyle.","Positive"
"270","Take a look at Google home.","Positive"
"271","The most ""fun"" with this product is trying to tick it off by asking really rude questions. Overall after ""adding"" mote knowledge to to Alexia it works fine. Google annoying questions to ask it and and let the fun begin!","Positive"
"272","Love Alexa.Only complaint is that she Amazon music does not always have the music I want to hear.","Negative"
"273","Awesome great sound!!!!!","Positive"
"274","Great sound, someone that really listens to me!","Positive"
"275","Favorite thing to own","Positive"
"276","Love the Echo!  Got it for a good price and decided to try it with full intention of returning if it didn't show value for us.  Although it started out slowly, we use Alexa more and more as we learn more about it.  She is really becoming part of the family over time.  :)  As other equipment is replaced in our house (garage door opener, thermostat, sprinkler controller) we are replacing them with ""alexa friendly"" devices.  It's really neat.","Positive"
"277","Bought for my wife to play music while she's cooking.  She loves it, so I love it.","Positive"
"278","Very happy with this delivery.","Positive"
"279","love it","Positive"
"280","have not been disappointed.","Negative"
"281","I love it","Positive"
"282","I am very pleased with the Echo.  It has pretty good sound for the size of the unit.  It is the perfect size for the condo.","Positive"
"283","We're in the kitchen finishing Thanksgiving dinner. My 2 year old daughter says ""recksa."" I said huh? This happens a couple times and then my wife says ""are you saying ALEXA?"" Which I followed up with ""oh, you want to hear Sesame Street?""","Positive"
"284","That was all it took. Alexa starts playing Sesame Street songs in the next room, and off goes my kid to dance and listen. It's past her bedtime, and she tricked us into getting Alexa to play songs for her.","Negative"
"285","This is absolutely the best thing I have ever bought off of Amazon. It does everthing, music, games, lights, security. Answers pretty much any question you ask. Very smart and getting smarter every day. Easy setup. Use it every day. Well worth the money","Positive"
"286","just ask and she does it, lights, music, ect. love it","Positive"
"287","Very nice product. I did however return it. The Dot is the same product for about $80 dollars less. I added a Bluetooth speaker, and BAM!!","Positive"
"288","Alexa is awesome and a new member to our family.","Positive"
"289","I love my Amazon Echo.  I used it daily.  Sadly someone actually stole it.  When I can afford it, I will replace it.","Negative"
"290","With Amazon dash buttons, mobile apps, Amazon.com and the plethora of other options combined with the absolute USELESS ability of this device of being anything smart for useful answers beyond basic conversions and arthymictic questions, it's an absolute waste of money. Even at the discounted price of $130 I feel shammed.","Negative"
"291","The good:","Positive"
"292","1. Excellent speakers - As good (if not better) than most mid-high bluetooth speakers on the market","Positive"
"293","2. Does a great job at basic things - News briefings, Weather, scores etc.","Positive"
"294","3. Seamless shopping on Amazon","Positive"
"295","1. Not very intelligent (yet). Terrible at ""unstructured"" queries. Google/Siri feel much more evolved","Negative"
"296","I am so TIRED of this horrible API.  Literally say the song's name, word for word, and it plays some off shoot version or not at all, even though the song is in my library.  Amazon has a LONG way to go in the programming department.","Negative"
"297","My best purchase ever. I have it setup with my Harmony Hub. I control my entire entertainment system with it. I also have it setup with VeraPlus. I can control my entire house. Turn on/off lights, turn off appliances and control both upstairs and downstairs thermostats. It is so awesome that I purchased a Dot2 for another room and I think I will purchase another Echo for upstairs. I use Alexa for my weather, commute, news and listen to Spotify. Alexa play Aerosmith, ""Playing Aerosmith from Spotify...... LOVE IT,","Positive"
"298","Echo is fun to have around the house! It keeps you updated with news and the weather every morning! It keeps you organized with your shopping needs and plays your favorite songs! If you are a single person alone at home this will keep you company!!!","Positive"
"299","The physical hardware is really OK.  Sure the speaker is mono but it has a decent sound for playing while I remodel my bathroom.  The voice pickup is outstanding and the signal processing for the phased array microphones works really well.  Then things go downhill.","Positive"
"300","Alexa's voice recognition (turning that signal into recognized speech) is pretty good.  It seems better than my daughter's iPhone, but not as good as my Samsung/Google phone.  I suspect this is the context part of the software that Google is just better at, but my phone also can't do that well without an internet connection so there is some backend processing at work.  The Alexa app frequently (but not always) will show you what it heard and give you some chance to provide feedback on it.","Positive"
"301","You can ask Alexa to play music in a genre which it does.  In the Classical vein this will typically be short, familiar pieces.  The musical equivalent of cotton candy.  There are a number of ""curated"" lists that Alexa can access which are usually ""relaxing"" or ""for reading""; in other words music to have on in the background and ignore.","Negative"
"302","The workaround you can find online is to build a ""playlist"" which contains the music you want.  You can go to the Amazon music app and browse and build a playlist.  That used to work pretty consistently until Amazon launched their music service and broke that functionality.  After that Alexa just plays a random piece of music that it thinks you will like.","Positive"
"303","The other unforgivable sin is that Alexa wants to shuffle.  She wants to shuffle so badly that when you put a whole album into your playlist Alexa shuffles the content on reading the list.  That's right, there is no way to turn off shuffle until after the shuffling has already occurred.  Put the album ""Toscanini complete Beethoven Symphonies"" and Alexa will start with the first movement of the 5th, then the first movement of the 9th, etc.","Negative"
"304","The good news, such as there is of it, is that all of these problems are on the back end.  The hardware piece that you buy is just an audio web browser.  The flawed content is entirely in the Amazon backend.  That means it can be fixed if Amazon wants to.  Right now there are probably 13 different ways you can query for a Beyonc song, but try to play that Bizet CD that Autoripped for you and forget it.","Positive"
"305","Echo, when playing classical music, has been reduced to the same level of functionality as a Bluetooth speaker.  If you have to manage everything from your phone by hand, what's the point of verbal access?","Positive"
"306","Once it thinks it figured out what you said is when it goes to Amazon for a search of some kind.  If its a canned search or something specific that Amazon is marketing it does pretty well.","Positive"
"307","They say Alexa is always learning.  Well you better be prepared to keep learning, too.","Positive"
"308","I don't review anything, this deserves my first review. I hate this thing! If I could, I'd give it 0 stars. I sincerely regret buying it. It has become an unreliable gonna drop you anytime, might work once in a blue-moon speaker with just as horrible an app. I could deal with it before because I could connect Bluetooth to play reliable music apps but it won 't even connect anymore. And generic emails from customer service disgrace the customer. Bring back real customer service!","Negative"
"309","Alexa is great!!!!","Positive"
"310","It sounds terrible, changes songs in the middle of the song for no apparent reason and really is nothing more than an expensive way to allow the consumer to buy more junk from Amazon.  I tried to return it but I was beyond their 30 day returns policy so they would only give me some credit to be determined and would not give me an address to the damn thing.  If I am only getting 25 bucks back I will donate it to,Goodwill and let some kid have fun with this.","Negative"
"311","LOVE IT, use it every day, get the news while making my coffee. listen to music, cant wait for it to connect with my Sonos in early 2017 update, then I can die happy.","Negative"
"312","AMAZING! I LOVE MY ECHO. I GET MANY COMPLIMENTS AND EVERYBODY WHO COMES OVER LOVES IT. MY 8 YEAR OLD USES IT AND I LOVE HOW YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE IT. I FEEL I AM TECH TRENDY, BUT HOW DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS SOONER. THANK YOU AMAZON! WELL DONE. RUN AND ORDER ONE RIGHT NOW, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!","Positive"
"313","I lesson to music most of the day, ask question, you ask it Echo does it. I woke up this morning, and just for heck of it, I said good morning, the echo said same to you, and Happy Thanksgiving. I was blown away. Worth every dime Amazon Echo!!! Dave","Positive"
"314","The family is having so much fun with Alexa and the Echo.  Certified Refurbished by Amazon is a great way to get great products, checked for quality assurance - just like new - and save a bunch of money.","Positive"
"315","Coolest tech out there!","Positive"
"316","kinda cool","Positive"
"317","Great product and excellent service","Positive"
"318","Greatest gadget ever! We love it.","Positive"
"319","Getting smarter everyday.","Positive"
"320","Love my Alexa she gives me info I want all day long!","Positive"
"321","LOVE THIS!!! It was super simple to set up and the sound quality is amazing!!!","Positive"
"322","Love it. Makes my life easier and more fun. my new housemate","Positive"
"323","I thought it would be able to look up just about anything on the internet, but I was wrong...But I do enjoy it daily!","Negative"
"324","Having so much fun with this. Listening to music, controlling my lights, getting weather etc.","Positive"
"325","Though Alexa is fun to use she's still missing some really basic skills like searching for things. She almost always cant find what I am looking for or just doesn't bother responding even though the app clearly shows she understood me. Half the time she won't play things from my Music library and tells me I don't own things I clearly do.","Positive"
"326","I enjoy my Amazon Echo. This product offers an abundance of use. I continue to learn it's capability. As a matter of fact, emails are sent to me regularly to notify me of the things this product can do. I mostly listen to music with it. You can ask Alexa to play anything you like. She can tell you the top news, weather, directions, etc.... basically anything you want to know.  I ask for the best route to work as I'm about to walk out of the door in the morning to avoid traffic.  You can even program the echo to sync with other electronics in your house. The uses are endless. My mom enjoyed it so much on her last visit to my house that she's buying one for herself.","Positive"
"327","Alexa, is great. We have enjoyed asking it question, trying to see if can stump it. We really enjoy the daily info that it shares when you tell it ""Good Morning"". Weather updates and the shopping list have been great features that we enjoy and use.","Positive"
"328","I bought my Echo on April 21, 2015 and already it has stopped working. Powerless, DOA, no power at all... I suspect it might just be the power supply but who knows?!? Either way this is not the life span I expected for this device or any device in the same product category.","Negative"
"329","Overall I like the technology, I own several Echo devices, however I find the hardware on this, my oldest Echo device. Has caused for my confidence to waiver and question whether Amazons hardware will really live up to the software.","Positive"
"330","My family loves this thing especially the kids, She helps them with homework and even cool fun facts! I love the ability to finally be able to control SMartthings with my voice this was huge! Her skills get better and more well rounded everyday! This is one device that i know i have definitely gotten  used multiple times a day every day!","Positive"
"331","Totally awesome!!!!! Still learning but having fun and it's all we expected!","Positive"
"332","Works as advertised! Really cool device. Highly recommend!","Positive"
"333","Great product. Words are not enough to express how satisfy I am.","Positive"
"334","Alexa is in my bathroom giving anyone using the bathroom great jamz...","Positive"
"335","Thank you Amazon for the payment plan.","Positive"
"336","Unfortunately it is way overrated. Even the most basic questions she cannot answer. Much worse than my Google phone. Apps? Appsolute garbage. Hope you like cat facts! or Bridge Trivia!","Negative"
"337","A: Im sorry, there is no devic","Negative"
"338","A: okay.","Positive"
"339","We don't use this quite as much as I had thought we would, but I still like having it around. The most used features for my family are: playing music through Pandora; checking the time; checking the weather; using as a timer; checking our Google calendar for events; adding shopping list items to our 'Our Groceries' app. We do have to be careful though as our 4 and 6-year-old kids have figured out how to add items to our Amazon shopping cart (fortunately, I haven't enabled the instant buy feature).","Positive"
"340","A: Im sorry, ...extremely long and annoying statement that just says she dosnt know anything.","Negative"
"341","A: Im sorry, extremely long and annoying statement.","Negative"
"342","A: Im sorry, ...extremely long and annoying statement.","Negative"
"343","M: FINE, Alexa, connect to the tablet","Positive"
"344","A: connecting to tablet (does not connect to tablet)","Positive"
"345","M: Alexa, set a timer for 10 minutes.","Positive"
"346","A: setting a timer for 10 minutes.","Positive"
"347","Weak speaker...bought the Dot instead and a Bose mini soundlink speaker that connects to my Dot so I get the best ultimate sound and all the functionality of Alexa to boot!","Positive"
"348","A: No timer is set.","Positive"
"349","A: There are 15 kinds of almonds, let me list them to you.","Positive"
"350","Like many things that are being sold as finished products these days, she is a work in progress. You spend half the time arguing with her and calling her names while you find a more traditional solution to your issues. I still use her, to turn off and on lights, I still use her for timers (although half the time I just use the microwave as you cannot tell if a timer is set or how much time is left without asking her, and some simple conversions and math shes okay with. I also use the shopping list app. Although, it MUST have a internet connection so if you are in a store with a bad connection (which is almost every store in my case), no shopping list for you!  Its near impossible to navigate Pandora stations or anything like that with her. Just know what you want before you ask her because you cant browse obviously. Like I said above, the apps fail half the time and the ones that do work are appsolutely rubbish.","Positive"
"351","Overall this is a toy. If that is what you want, you will like it. If you actually hope to use it for anything with any sort of consistency, you might be disappointed.","Positive"
"352","Amazing!  This is so much fun and so practical that I can't believe I never had it before. My family just loves it too. Can't wait to order a pizza with it. There was a bit of a learning curve but not much. Plus if you google ""echo"" lots and lots of info out there. I highly recommend this futuristic machine.","Positive"
"353","Really love the Echo.","Positive"
"354","This is the greatest device. I use it everyday and connected hue lights and a nest thermostat. Everything works perfectly. Lots of uses and well worth the price.","Positive"
"355","I love the Echo and the Alexa app which is the voice for the Echo.  I have had the Echo since August 2016.  I learn new features about it every day.  I find the Echo useful for weather updates, news,  to spell words, to read my books or to play my Audible books for me when I'm busy.  I can create reminders for taking pills or appointments.  I can tell the Echo to add items to my  shopping list which I can carry with me on my phone or print it out if I prefer.  I also can create a to-do list.","Positive"
"356","If I wake up in the middle of the night, I can ask the Echo the time, the weather or to read for a set time such 10, 15 minutes or more until I can go back to sleep or I can even ask for a joke.  If I tell the Echo to stop reading, I can pick up my Kindle the next time I want to read and will not have lost my place in the story.  The Echo will play my music playlists or I can ask for new music by favorite singers.  I can also request almost any kind of music to suit my mood with Amazon's Music Unlimited app.  There are a large number of skills on the Amazon Alexa site which can enabled to make the Echo even more useful.","Positive"
"357","Love it!!!!! So much fun and can do so much!","Positive"
"358","It is an amazing product and look forward to see what else it will be able to do in the future.","Positive"
"359","I also found the Echo amazingly easy to set up.  I purchased several EchoDots, the smaller speakers in the Echo family, that connect by wireless so I can talk to the Echo almost anywhere in my house.","Positive"
"360","As you can tell from my review, I highly recommend the Amazon Echo.","Positive"
"361","We like it ... especially for playing music.","Positive"
"362","My daughter loves her echo. She's constantly playing music, setting alarms, etc.  when it's playing music it is hard to ""wake""  Alexa so I often find her yelling over her music to ""get her attention"" Good purchase, but wish we had gotten the dot bc of the better value and ability to connect headphones or a speaker.","Positive"
"363","I know she will love it","Positive"
"364","A fun and even handy device.  Looking forward to other capabilities being added as time goes on.","Positive"
"365","Great. I love using it","Positive"
"366","Finally, something in this house that does what I ask, when I ask!  I'd write more, but right now Alexa is lulling me to sleep with my requested 'music to sleep by' selections.  If only she could dispense chocolate on demand.  My new BFF.","Positive"
"367","I am so glad I bought this! It is pretty awesome! She listens to you to! Was alittle worried because it was a refurbished! Works great so far and I've listened to her alot!","Positive"
"368","This has been great to have! Use it all the time for many different reasons! Sound is really goo too!","Positive"
"369","Does not pick up all voice commands or maybe she is just ignoring me. Have much better success with my tap.","Positive"
"370","works good","Positive"
"371","Love it","Positive"
"372","Awesome product.  I would recommend that Alexa have a little more personality.","Positive"
"373","I thought my kindle paper white was the best ""gadget"" I ever bought until I got ""Alexa"" Echo. I have been able to listen to music that most people weren't lucky enough to know...Jack Jones, Shirley Bassey, Jerry Vale, etc...etc. It's the perfect gift for parents and grandparents (me). So easy, just set to WiFi and listen. LOVE LOVE LOVE it.","Positive"
"374","The only reason i am rating it 3 stars is because my Echo did not come with a remote control, while i have a friend who purchased the same product and a remote control was included. If there is an option of buying the remote control, i will gladly appreciate purchasing one for my echo.","Positive"
"375","Be aware if you want to play prime music, they will charge you an additional fee, even if you are a prime member!  They should tell you this upfront!","Positive"
"376","Best purchase ever!  I just got  Alexa yesterday and I love it.  Set up took 5 minutes or less.  Plugged her in, downloaded the App and followed the prompts to connect her to Wi-Fi and my Amazon account.  We were talking like old friends in minutes.  I'm so impressed. The sound quality is awesome.  I enjoyed listening to my Prime music and my ITunes music (I imported my iTunes music into my Prime Library).  I can also listen to my IPod via the Bluetooth connection if I want.  Alexa walked my thru the Bluetooth set up.  Set up for Bluetooth was the easiest than any other device I have tried in the past (Bose Bluetooth set up took many tries).  I'm impressed with just listening to music at this point.  I know there are other features to fall in love with.  I can't wait to play with her some more.  I would recommend to anyone..","Positive"
"377","LOVING the Echo/Alexa.....having so much fun, along with the music. Actually like the idea to use electric and not battery.","Positive"
"378","love it","Positive"
"379","The Echo exceeded my expectations and is so easy to use. Since it is connected with my Amazon Music account I can enjoy all kinds of music which is great because I have an eclectic taste in music. That is only the beginning! I am looking forward to exploring all the other endless things it can do.","Positive"
"380","I've had it for a week now. The family really enjoying the Amazon music service. All types of genres at the command of your voice. I've installed 2 Tp-link smart switches. Easy to use and integrate with Alexa. I'm able to control my outside lighting for my home. You can also set up a schedule for the lights. Also if you're away from your home you can turn on/off the lights with your smartphone. The possibilities are endless. I'm still exploring other skills. I was fortunate to get it on sale during the one year anniversary. I really recommend this product.","Positive"
"381","I've owned this since it initially came out. The sound is great, the design is great, and it has quite a few useful features.","Positive"
"382","The search function though? Horrid. Alex doesn't understand questions, and I've noticed it's becoming worse over time. I really hope Amazon steps up its game in regard to this, because I don't want to buy a Google Home as a companion to this.","Positive"
"383","I just love Alexa... where has she been been all my life?","Positive"
"384","OK, so I've had my Echo for a few months now and it is terrific.  Love using the skills.  The speakers are awesome and can output very clear music.  Only downside is it's inability to do some simple searches.  (i.e. When is XYZ television show aired?) Hoping as it ""learns"" it's searching ability is more consistent.","Positive"
"385","Highly recommend the echo. Does everything as advertised and as additional apps are added it will be indispensable.","Positive"
"386","Wow <f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+0098> my Amazon  Echo -Black. Fun to have her name  is Alexa ,she's your best friend  n Roommate ask her anything she has the aAnswer. She s  like your assitant.","Positive"
"387","Great product.  Love using it, still finding out all about it.","Positive"
"388","Works good but doesn't have all the songs I'm looking for.I thought I spoke well but it has a hard time understanding me at times..I guess Alexa should come with a new York accent","Positive"
"389","Just got,one and Its so,worth it.  Unbelievable sound. Love it!","Positive"
"390","I enjoy having a smart voice-controlled device, but I have not found myself using the voice control for more than just asking Alexa to play a song on spotify. Occasionally, I will ask Alexa to tell me a joke, put something on my to-do list, tell me the weather, or set an alarm, but I often find my phone a more convenient utility for these features, so the utility for those features diminish.  The Echo becomes more useful once you acquire and integrate more smart home features like lights and locks, which is something I have not found the motivation to do--the value proposition is not there yet. The Echo also requires having it plugged in at all times, which can be very inconvenient when needing to move it to a new room, plugging in and waiting for it to connect to the internet again.","Positive"
"391","Fun","Positive"
"392","My unit does not work - constantly needs to be turned off and on to reset. Very frustrating - perhaps Google's device is the better way to go?","Positive"
"393","Awesome","Positive"
"394","Limited voice recognition.  Not even close to Siri or Google.  Certainly a waste of money in my opinion.","Negative"
"395","Amazing device easy set up and never ""talks back"" lol","Positive"
"396","I am new to the Echo. It's not only informative, great sound, diverse range of music, news,  stations ,Playlists. Alarms. This is a great product. I use it for ordering items to shuffling various music genre's. Very pleased. Alexa app is greatly appreciated. Will be adding on to the various smart devices that work with Echo. Family fun with Alexa as well, jokes for all ages, reading, headlines news. Enjoying Echo very much. I will update this review in a month. Owned for 5 weeks. User friendly!  No regrets thus far!","Positive"
"397","I have had it for a year now and Alexa is as good as advertised.","Positive"
"398","Enjoyable and helpful having Alexia in my home! Watch our for school kids, for she will do ALL their homework! - Dwight","Positive"
"399","Oh my goodness!  Alexa is my new best friend.  Great sound and I love all the other features, shopping list, to do list etc.  At age 76 my memory for the little things could use an overhaul.  It's great when I am cooking and see that I am running low on something to speak to Alexa and have her add to my shopping list.  Never thought I would be so fond of an electronic, but I am.  Now if I could just program her to do floors and clean the toilets I would be over the moon.","Positive"
"400","It went connect to my smart devices","Positive"
"401","My wife bought me an Amazon Echo for my birthday this past September.  I really like the device and have had great listening music through iHeartRadio, HOWEVER, with the holiday season upon us we cannot get iHeartRadio to play the iHeart Christmas station.  I can play the station through the app on my smartphone but Alexa DOES NOT recognize the station.  I've been in contact with Amazon about this and they tell me several people have reported this issue and it's unknown when and if it will be addressed and they have recommended that I utilize another 3rd party music provider.  All other iHeartRadio stations work with the exception of the Christmas station.  As a Christian, I find this to be suspect.  If this matter is resolved in a timely fashion I'd consider a higher review but I'm not going to hold my breath.","Positive"
"402","Unbelievable! What a fantastic devise. I went shopping for a very high end music system and came home with a factory refurbished Echo that I wouldn't part with for anything! It id great! AAA+","Positive"
"403","Love it","Positive"
"404","Fun to play with and great sounding speakers.","Positive"
"405","Just started to use it yesterday.  Love it!  Absolutely love it.  Wonderful clear and crisp sound with decent fabricated bass.  A must have.  Just in the one afternoon of use, of course any music I wanted was there, I asked about weather as well and jokes.  The capability is so much bigger than what I'm using right now.","Positive"
"406","I love ALEXA!!! The speakers are amazing quality and is so much more useful than Siri!","Positive"
"407","I love my echo","Positive"
"408","There are good points and bad points about this.  The value you get from this will depend on how you plan to use it.  If you have a lot of smart devices (like nest or hue lights) in your home and plan on connecting them up, then you will get a lot of good use from this.  You can also use it to order items on amazon, add items to your Google calendar, play any music you can think of, find your smart phone,  hook it up with IFTTT and other things.  There are over 900 some ""skills"" that you can download and activate, but no good way to search them to find the best ones in my opinion.  Out of the box it will play music for you, tell you jokes and order things from your Amazon account, and some other things but if you want more functionality you need to enable more skills.  Comes with a small booklet of ""things to try""","Positive"
"409","Omg. This thing is awesome.  I am glad I didn't buy a regular Bluetooth speaker.  The echo is amazing","Positive"
"410","Long time Echo owner and I still feel strongly enough about Alexa to write a positive review and it's been at least a year and a half.  She's become a fixture in my home and I use her everyday for music, timers, weather, news, and other random stuff.  She feels like a real person and has so many capabilities that each owner can use her to their liking.  I can see Amazon's commitment to upgrading the Echo and staying on the cutting edge of connectivity and artificial intelligence over the time I've owned it.  I fully recommend the Echo (Alexa) to anyone and everyone.  Amazon did a great job with this one.","Positive"
"411","The sound quality was great.  No complaints at all there.  You can also control volume manually, or speak it by saying Alexa volume down or Alexa volume 6 for instance.","Negative"
"412","We find Alexa isn't as good at understanding our voice commands as Google Search is.  It is not uncommon for us to have to repeat commands because the Echo can't understand them or didn't register anyone was speaking in the first place.  It is hard for it to recognize a voice command when there is background noise.","Negative"
"413","It's nice being able to control things with just a voice command, but many times I'm wishing for a screen to see things on, which is where the Alexa App comes in, but I find the app to be lacking, it's not as sleek and user friendly or feature rich as I want.  For instance you can't delete all history at once and it will save every command you ask it.  So if you asked it something you didn't want anyone else to know you asked, you have to go in and find the certain request and manually delete it.","Positive"
"414","The Echo is growing on me more and more as we slowly add more skills to it.  We love the bedtime stories and the ability to listen to so much music and talk radio.  My main beef is that music when played from Amazon does not have the same volume level.  Sometimes it gets louder sometimes quieter.  Have to constantly adjust volume.  Do like the voice control, but if you don't speak clearly and succinctly it doesn't always do a good job of hearing and understanding.  You also need to speak quickly, if you hesitate in a request too much it will time out before you get your request spoken.","Positive"
"415","Best gadget we had!","Positive"
"416","arrived in perfect condition and is working great. enjoying this device very much.","Positive"
"417","love it","Positive"
"418","I love love my Alexa so do my grandkids we take it from room to room","Positive"
"419","I own both the Amazon Echo and the Amazon Echo Dot (2nd Generation), so I'm writing from the perspective of someone who enjoys both, but for different reasons.","Positive"
"420","Great!","Positive"
"421","First off, the Amazon voice service is pretty amazing for most of the things I want to do. I ask Alexa about the weather, news headlines and things like that each morning to start my day. I also use it to play music easily when I'm getting ready, and also use it to set timers and stuff like that when I'm doing various activities. If you don't mind dropping nearly $200 to add a few extra minutes back in your schedule, it's pretty great for that.","Positive"
"422","This leads me to the only criticism I really have: the speaker on the Amazon Echo seems like it is lacking a good bit and not worth $179. That's why I offer up the fact that I also own the Echo Dot, which I have hooked up to my stereo system in my living room. This is where I do the majority of music listening, so having this connected to Spotify and my Bose speakers is awesome. But, when I listen to the Amazon Echo system by itself in my bedroom, you can tell there's a definite difference. (I know I'm comparing this to a Bose system, but I'm just saying - if you want good quality music, you're going to need better speakers.)","Positive"
"423","So, maybe don't believe people who think the speaker is really wonderful. It's exactly what it looks like: a tiny speaker that is just okay. If you're only interested in voice interaction and potentially hooking Alexa up to your speaker system, get the Echo Dot only.","Positive"
"424","I bought this as a gift for my husband and I can't wait to give it on Christmas morning. I opened the package just to make sure it arrived safely, and was really impressed at the quality. It's got a good weight to it, not easily knocked over when sitting out. I read through the instructions, so it wasn't time consuming on Christmas morning, and was pleasantly surprised to find out that it's very simple to operate.","Positive"
"425","Love the echo, use it for my calendar, and to listen to music primarily.","Positive"
"426","Pretty cool for playing music, looking up the weather and answering SOME questions. My husband and I love looking up random facts when we don't know something and I was hoping it would have voice recognition and look up ability similar to the google voice search, but more often than not Alexa says she doesn't understand my question, which is a bummer. Hoping to set it up to turn on lights but so far haven't been able to identify the best option for our home.","Positive"
"427","Okay so, I wanted to love this I really did. Out of the box it is a beautiful device that seemed to work very well. Now though there are so many issues. The volume wheel doesn't spin properly. Alexa answers me, but doesn't follow through with a response or a command. It's frustrating. I payed good money to have this work properly in my home, but I would say before buying explore your options because there are definitely better speakers out there and now that Google Home is out, that is worth a look!","Positive"
"428","Overall, I just think the product is a made a bit cheap and has too many flaws for something at that price point.","Negative"
"429","Was a little skeptical buying referbished but I couldn't be happier! Alexa has become an everyday essential in the house! Our little one even used it to sing him happy birthday for a quick pick me up! Lol so happy with this purchase and highly suggest to any house with a family or even just roommates. She's the life of the party!","Positive"
"430","Great product.  I was received mine in January 2015 and have seen it grow from a device with fairly limited capabilities into something that is useful on a daily basis.  The ability to check my calendar and add events was a great addition to its abilities.","Positive"
"431","Needs to come with pre-defined ""links"" to news sources, etc.  Out of the box, it should be able to answer ""Alexa, what is the stock price of X?""  but it can't -- you first have to set up a connection with a stock quote provider....  tedious for each of your news sources.  Amazon should pick a standard ""bundle"", like Basic Cable, which gives you a useful environment to work in.  Ditto for setting up and connecting my music from Amazon Prime Music to makes lists that Alexa can play.....","Positive"
"432","Fantastic !!!!","Positive"
"433","I can't say enough about Alexa.  This is the greatest gift I've ever gotten.  Extremely useful in everyday activities and controlling lights, appliances, and other technology.  I have bought 2 more for my daughters.  They work great and voice recognition has been spot on for us.  I love adding things to my shopping list as I think of them and then just looking on my phone and never forgetting items any longer.  I have prime and love just asking for whatever music I want at any given moment.  We currently use smart plugs and hues lights with it and have had zero issues with them working.  It's so easy to have Alexa do whatever and whenever you need it.  Just buy it!!!","Positive"
"434","I received the Amazon Echo as a gift one year ago.","Positive"
"435","The echo makes simple tasks even simpler! It has replaced my alarm clock completely, I can add a to-do list, I can check the weather every morning, etc.","Positive"
"436","There are a few cons that could be a big deal breaker like:","Positive"
"437","Amazon limits a lot of features for non-prime users like using spotify, ordering pizza, adding your own music","Positive"
"438","Every once in a while the echo will think I said, ""Alexa"" and it will trigger random actions.","Positive"
"439","Don't be worried though with every con there is a pro:","Negative"
"440","Love it - so much fun.","Positive"
"441","You can control your house if you have the right accessories","Positive"
"442","Overall this product is really cool to have around and makes a lot of tasks simpler.","Positive"
"443","We've been pleased with the Echo.  'So far we use it only for music, quick questions such as how to spell something, and my favorite: playing thunderstorm and rain sounds.  (We live in the Mojave Desert.)","Positive"
"444","So dreadfully disappointed.  This is a limited use item.  Amazon limits your music imports to 250 songs at the base commitment monthly fee (8 bucks) and charges for your uploads monthly after that. The news management is awkward to adjust after your initial programming. All in all I rather wish I hadn't bothered to give amazon a try on this one.  Back to Sonos.","Negative"
"445","Great great product. Good sound, and I am particular about the sound. I roll over in bed in the morning and tell Alexa to connect me to my Public Radio station. Nice playing music from Amazon Prime which costs extra. Alexa's jokes are so bad they are good. We use it to control lights in several locations in the house.","Positive"
"446","Amazing voice recognition","Positive"
"447","wont stay online..got a new router and infinity hookup  when I leave home it is on, but when I come home  it off line  , so it wont turn on the light for","Positive"
"448","My entire family enjoys Alexia! This device is in the center of our home! She keeps our grocery list, many reminders, plays all of our favorite playlists, orders amazon items, wakes us up, tells us when its time to leave, adds events to our calendars, and much much more!","Positive"
"449","I love Alexa!!! I bought Google Home first and took it back immediately. Echo is so much better. A far superior experience.","Positive"
"450","Few glitches but I like it,","Negative"
"451","The main reason I bought it was the payment options. I wanted one but wasn't sure if I needed it. Well after I set it up my family was hooked.  Honestly if you are in the market for a smart speaker you can't go wrong.","Positive"
"452","I've been an Echo user since the very beginning, pre-ordering my Echo back in January 2015.  What started out as experiment in AI has now become a very useful tool in our household.  I've since added a couple more Echo Dots around the house because I found myself wanting a reply to calling ""Alexa"" anywhere in the house I was. We started using it for music, time and weather.  Now we use it for news, directions, ordering, controlling our home thermostat, and most recently, as a personal assistant in my home office.  Way better than Cortana or Siri. Have since added Amazon Music's subscription for Echo for even more music capability.  I am probably most impressed by the commitment the Amazon team has to actively improving the platform, which is communicated to me through occasional email updates on the capabilities they have added to Echo.  The full-blown speaker version is good -- I had it in my kitchen for a long while as my primary music device.  I've since moved the full-sized Echo to the master bathroom and use it for all my updates in the morning.  I now use Echo dots connected to my computer and to my Sonos as the main kitchen and office Alexas.  Either way, you'll find a device format that works for you and once you commit to actually learning how best to use it, it really is a cool tool that you can use to make your day easier and more informative.","Positive"
"453","two years old and it quit working - no power guess  that may be the life span - cool while it lasted - not sure i would do it again","Positive"
"454","I bought this in July so I'm a little late with my review, I love this device! I bought it originally to replace my outdated stereo & since I could place this anywhere it worked great outside when we have company but it could not be to far from the house otherwise the wifi would disconnect. The only downfall so far is I had to buy another one because I mistakenly put it in the room with my bird to entertain her while I'm not home (Congo African Grey) and she is now loving it, she can turn it on, play music, skip a song & turn the volume up all without my help so if I don't disable it at night I wake up to music playing at 5am lol. So if my bird can run this device anyone can is the morale of my story. Enjoy it nothing is perfect so don't pic it apart unless you get a faulty one & they refuse to replace it.","Positive"
"455","I love it","Positive"
"456","Wow fun stuff!  Recognized my voice perfect in about 5 min!","Positive"
"457","I bought this for one purpose: to play music in a room far away from my desk computer and entertainment setup. It is a complete disaster. Not the device itself, which is brilliant, but the back end.","Positive"
"458","From what I have since read, it used to work. Therefore, Amazon can fix it. But will Amazon fix it?","Positive"
"459","It's Great fun! Ask it to tell you a joke, too cute.","Positive"
"460","If it weren't for integration through IFTTT and Stringify, I would find it limiting.  I am using this as my interactions with my smart accessories.","Positive"
"461","Not worth the money. Doesn't understand most of what you ask it. Can find some radio stations, tell me the time and temperature. Otherwise, faster to look up info.","Positive"
"462","in love with Alexa","Positive"
"463","White is rite for my decor setting it up was not easy needed a techie to get wifi that done the Amazon echo for beginners is a great help after getting the book and I don't work for Amazon the setup became much easier and quicker when you catch on Alexa is 2 x as fast as u r an amazing joke teller she keeps the great grand kids busy for hours","Positive"
"464","Love this","Positive"
"465","After the initial excitement we only use it for weather, news updates and occasional night time game or radio.  Most of the time when playing games it misunderstands my words.  It's okay.  Mostly got the Echo because of the speaker instead of the Dot.  Probably wouldn't recommend it though.","Positive"
"466","Nice product with connectivity on Spotify and other services. Also working with Philips Hue kit and a lot of other services. Recognize the voice easily.","Positive"
"467","My Alexa seems to be a little temperamental, she responds when she feels like it to who she wants.  I might need to return it, not sure if it's the product or I'm still getting the hang of it.","Positive"
"468","this is a must-have for music lovers!","Positive"
"469","I LOVE my Echo! I highly recommend you to buy one.","Positive"
"470","I love my Echo!  It is my first speaker that I have ever bought and I am in love with it.  Alexa does everything that I need her to do and MORE.  All of my friends (and even my parents) wish that they had one.  Great gift idea for pretty much anyone!","Positive"
"471","Very convenient.  I'm a big fan.","Positive"
"472","I just got this toy. I love it. There is still much I haven't used it for yet, but the concept is awesome. Alexa understands very well, and does learn as she goes. I just need to get all the items for her to interface with my house. If you just want a good speaker, she is good for that as well. I was thinking about this or Google Home. The Google item just doesn't look neat. Kind of drab actually. I love the way technology is heading, and this is a neat toy to have if you are a tech fan like me.","Positive"
"473","You can read all the advertising hype - and it's all true.  I may not use all the features - but I love the sound.  Looking forward to having Alexa read some of my books to me.","Negative"
"474","Great concept , but the capabilities are not grand.","Positive"
"475","It's amazing, I got for my daughter's birthday and she was happy to have it , she's 8 years old and she got all the answers she asked from Alexa<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083>.","Positive"
"476","No one can say anything more accurate (and damning) about the Echo/Alexa experience than what Amazon itself said. It It reads news/weather, answers random useless trivia questions (e.g. ""How far away is Pluto?"") and plays music. That's it. If you find asking it what the population of Peru is, or how many rods there are in a mile, then buy it. This is simply not compelling to me.","Negative"
"477","The Alexa skills are rather lacking and a bit bizzare, hard to use,and hard to discover. (eg ""Alexa, ask Purina what dog is good for child."") Supposedly the Alexa can control your lights, but only if you buy all new wifi enable lightbulbs.","Negative"
"478","Also, if you have small children, you will underestimate the number of times they just yell at it.","Negative"
"479","Other than that, it's a perfectly serviceable Bluetooth speaker.","Positive"
"480","We really did love our Amazon Echo, right up until it quit working 15 months after purchasing, and after the warranty ran out. Amazon support said it might be the power adapter and they gave us a credit for $20.00 to purchase another one. But, that didn't fix the problem. So, now the best they will do is give us another small credit ($30.00) to apply towards another Echo. We have decided to wait and get the Google one.","Positive"
"481","Very disappointed!","Negative"
"482","I got it for my parents anniversary and they love it.","Positive"
"483","Great product!","Positive"
"484","The best! Recommended to 17 people and they all love it!","Positive"
"485","Refurbished unit did not work properly from the beginning. Don't waste your time or money. Worked then didn't work. Called tech support. Worked then didn't work. Not worth the effort.","Positive"
"486","Very satisfied with my purchase of the refurbished Echo. Works perfectly and actually the refurbished model exceeds my expectations. Love all the features and ease of use especially when used with the Android phone app. With the phone app you can turn on or off lights anywhere you have cell service. Picked up a couple of the TP-Link Smart Wi-Fi plugs. Now I just say ""Alexa, turn on the Christmas Tree"". No more climbing around the tree looking for the plug. Also, have Echo turn on and off the living room lights. That's nice if you're in bed and hear a strange noise in the house. You can turn on the lights without even getting up. Have plans to add a Wi-Fi wall switch to turn on the bedroom ceiling fan. Ever get in bed and forget to turn on the fan - No problem with Alexa's help. Be sure to check out all the Skills for Echo now available and more to be added.","Positive"
"487","Horrible customer service. Had the unit/item since July 2016 and it had quit. Blue light keeps spinning and factory reset does not work. Unable to understand Amazon Rep...broken English. He accessed the unit to troubleshoot and unable to find solution. Unable to troubleshoot..transferred to a 4th person. Not sure why Amazon can't stand behind their product. I will be cancelling my Prime account and not purchase anything else.","Negative"
"488","What I can say that hasn't been said.  This product has changed the way that I operate my household.  I initially bought this to control my Harmony Companion remote & hub.  But then Nexia which powers my smart home hub introduced a Nexia smart home skill for Amazon Echo.  Boy did that ever change the game for me.  Now I tell Alexa to turn on the tv when I want to watch tv or I tell her to turn a movie when I want to watch a movie.  When it's time for bedtime I tell her to turn off the tv and then I tell her to turn on bedtime, which is one my Nexia scenes/automation.  When I tell her that the lights in the front of the house turn off and the master bedroom/bathroom lights come on.  If I want to turn on/off a light at any point during the time and I'm not near the light switch I let Alexa do it for me.","Positive"
"489","I will add a Echo Dot this week to the master bedroom.  That way when I open my eyes in the morning I can tell Echo to turn on the good morning scene and I'll be set to wake up.  I love this thing in conjunction my my Nexia system and my Harmony remote/hub.  If you have a smart home hub that works with Amazon Echo you should add the Echo to your system.  You will not regret it.  This device takes home automation to the next level.","Positive"
"490","I own two of these. One in my bedroom and one in the living room. This is a very solid product. The sound is great considering the size of this unit. Listening to music is great on this and if you're a prime member then you would definitely be getting your money's worth. I use my echo as part of my home automation, it works great with my lutron light system and my trane thermostats. Once you get one and use it for a while it will be hard to remember what life was like before this. The echo is always improving with constant updates and new skills added daily.","Positive"
"491","Alexa is my new BFF.  I can ask her the weather, ask her when my appointments are, ask her to play all kinds of music, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.  I can't wait to hook my house up to her so she can close the garage door when I forget, and turn the lights down...I work at home and she is absolutely indispensable.  Sometimes when I'm working, I just want some music in the background but it ruins my concentration to get up to the radio.  She also gets me up and dancing when I'm cleaning the house, and when the phone rings I can instantly silence her with my voice.  My son loves the jokes she tells, and sometimes she comes up with some really interesting answers.  She's so used to me now, I just ask her for music and she plays exactly what I like.  How does she do that?","Positive"
"492","added alot to the kitchen and easy to use.  will get for all the kids for christmas","Positive"
"493","There's a book available on Amazon called ""Amazon Echo: 2017 Edition - User Guide and Manual - Learn It Live It Love It""","Positive"
"494","A great addition to the home. Not only informative, but now works with several hubs controlling lights and home entertainment.","Positive"
"495","Why in the sam hill did I wait so long to get this?  I absolutely love it!","Negative"
"496","I love listening to music while working around the house, but don't like having to go select the next song if playing from my cell phone or on a DVD player when a song comes on that I'm not in the mood for.","Positive"
"497","With the Echo, I can tell Alexa ""next"" or I can tell Alexz to switch to a different artist/decade of music/type of music any time I want.  I can also make a request for a specific song and BAM!  It's playing!","Positive"
"498","I can't believe how user friendly the Echo is and how easy it is to get up and running.  Within 10 minutes of taking it out of the box, I was listening to my favorite hits for the 1970s.  It's also fun to ask Alexa random questions and see how she answers.  LOL!","Positive"
"499","I now know what to get all my family members for Christmas!  They'll love it!","Positive"
"500","I've had mine a little over a year & the top has come off in various pieces... I have tried to get them back on - with no luck.  It still works to some extent - but there aren't any controls on the top anymore.  Will try to see in Amazon will stand behind it and fix it or replace it - even though it was purchased over a year ago...  So I had to buy an Echo Dot to replace it.","Positive"
"501","LOVE MY ECHO!  I have her (yes, I refer to her as a person now) set up to control my Phillips Hue lights (which by the way was extremely simple to sync Alexa to them). I also use her to control my extremely hectic calendar and maintain my shopping list!","Positive"
"502","Love it! We use it in the bedroom and have the echo dot in the family room downstairs.","Positive"
"503","It easy to use and fun to have.","Positive"
"504","Thank you for an awesome product","Positive"
"505","Make sure you get it and read it.  Without that, you'll never know just how much Alexa is willing to do for you!","Positive"
"506","Love Alexa.","Positive"
"507","One of the best purchases I have made! This product is a necessary purchase for all electronic geeks!  Haven't had it long enough to get a full feeling for all of its features, but I am blown away at this point!","Positive"
"508","If i could leave a zero  or no starz . I bought into amazon on this one . The speaker id good but the AI sucks . Don't buy . There are better products out there","Positive"
"509","Do not have a smart home so we couldn't really use it.","Positive"
"510","Bought this as a gift for my son. Who happens to be a programmer. He's very happy with it. Which in and of itself is amazing. But he is actually quite gifted with tech. And is doing some pretty amazing things with this tool.","Positive"
"511","Its ok but kind of gimmicky have found some useful things it will do still trying to integrate my NEST to it and Hopefully Sonos next year","Negative"
"512","179$ for a blue tooth speaker, wifi required to function for voice commands. If voice commands functioned without wifi I may give it 5 stars. I am really just complaining because I like it so much I cannot take it with me.","Positive"
"513","This is amazing and I can't wait to see when new functionality comes out.","Negative"
"514","I really love my echo! It's super convenient. I really like telling it to play me music and order stuff for me. It's very easy to use. I can make my grocery lists just by talking to Alexa! Alexa has made my life a little bit easier. I have not had any problems with mine.","Positive"
"515","fast shipping package well would buy from again seems well made  bought 6 dots after using.  alexa is in every room with me","Positive"
"516","It works great, looks sexy in my house, the kids get a kick out of it, and when you have guests over you can really knock their socks off once you REALLY learn how to use it....  What more do you need from a non-essential gadget?","Positive"
"517","Great product I would buy again","Positive"
"518","Still learning to use it, but am satisfied.","Positive"
"519","1. Parental controls to avoid playing music with explicit lyrics... without that (as a parent) it is another issue to deal with.","Negative"

"521","Easy to set up great for information","Positive"

"528","this product is unbelievable. I asked ot to listen to radio station in london england and Alexia found it and started playing. If you have prime you have thousands of songs you can play.  sound is great. going to get one for my 2 children. they will love it.","Positive"
"529","Bought for daughter-in-law. It's everything advertised!!! She loves it. Many thanks, as she is sooooooo hard to buy for.","Negative"

"532","Free!","Positive"
"533","Loved it when it first came out.  Dealing with a lot of bait ware now, it doesn't work the same.","Positive"
"534","When providing functionality, it should be clear that what you are accustomed to can go away at any time.  Trying to find a new use for it now.  It's still a good clock, a good weather device.","Positive"
"535","This is great I'm having so much fun with it I love the way to work play music questions my answers right away","Positive"
"536","Love our Echo but after 2 years it's a $200 paperweight. It was working fine until it was unplugged and moved. When we plugged it back in... nothing. After all sorts of troubleshooting nothing. Apparently the ""unplugging Echo wrecks the Echo"" problem is more common than you realize. We will get a new one(customer service giving us a whopping $15 off for our troubles), it just bothers me it has a 2 year working life. They do replace them if the issue occurs in the first few months. If yours works, do not unplug it lest you suffer the consequences.","Positive"
"537","Very cool","Positive"
"538","nothing but a toy","Positive"
"539","Hope they come our with Drag and Drop programability and MUCH better LiFx integration.  Doesnt acknowledge rooms I have programmed with LiFX  ""Alexa,  turn the bedroom lights red""  ""Please try again with the device name and setting "" she says...","Negative"
"540","Useful for only a few things. Can't do search. I'm sure Google Home will dominate once it's out and refined.","Positive"
"541","Super cool tech!! love it","Positive"
"542","I bought this because I got a good deal through prime when it came out, at first it was overwhelming, but once you learn each part its quite helpful.","Positive"
"543","Like it.","Positive"
"544","The Echo is absolutely as cool as it seems BUT !! Its even cooler. It works with you and learns what your all about before answering questions. It works to listen to you and the way you talk. Its true this ones a keeper. 5 stars. You have to give her a little time to get used to you, the way you talk and what you talk about its always getting smarter. I love this Echo.  Paul  PS my apps do not seem to work even though I have been charged every month, could someone help me with this.","Positive"
"545","My husband bought this for us and I didn't know what it was. Six months later and I would hate to live without it lol. Turns on our apartment lights when we enter, and off when going to bed, tells me the weather and news daily, and plays the music I want when I want at the volume I want. Highly recommend.","Negative"
"546","would not work I sent it back","Positive"
"547","Sadly it stopped working shortly after the warranty was up, disappointed because I really didn't use it that much and expect it to last a lot longer. I will not purchase another,","Negative"
"548","Love it. Compliments my Prime Membership.","Positive"
"549","Use it all the time for music, weather, comedic relief with jokes, shopping list, timers and nearby restaurants. Need to get some of the smart tech plugs and lights to connect it to, that seems to be a big part of its uses.","Positive"
"550","nice product.","Positive"
"551","Pretty cool, but would like it better if you could link your contacts to text or call. The sound is decent from level 5 or lower, and even though the volume can get fairly loud, the quality suffers at the higher levels.","Positive"
"552","After purchasing this item, i found that of the two I bought, one of them has a bad speaker... is there quality checks on refurbished goods?","Negative"
"553","I like how this thing can spit out information in seconds and so alert.  I just wish it could do follow-up without having to start all over again.  Great improvements and looking forward to more updates in the future.","Positive"
"554","Great speaker, voice command response is 95% accurate from anywhere in our family room, sound quality is great.  My major uses are internet radio (via free Tune-in membership), sports scores and game schedule and time, quick news and stock market briefings, measurement conversions.  Great on all counts.","Positive"
"555","Bought just because I liked the concept and thought it would just be a fun novelty.  Wow was I wrong. Have owned for over a year and continually find more uses for Alexa.  If you don't already know what it can do, read the product page.  I don't think a single day goes by that I do not use one of the many features, experiment with the substantial list of easter eggs or just play music.  By the way,  these go to 11.","Positive"
"556","Good for Amazon Prime Music playlists, but often goes off line and biggest need for improvement - can't really answer questions like a smart phone.  Make a deal with Google and expand the capabilities!","Positive"
"557","I love Alexa. It's a great personal digital assistant. I use it throughout the day for news updates, music, podcasts and research.","Positive"
"558","Bought is a Christmas gift for my brother. Do not know how he likes it yet as Christmas is next month, but heard many great things about it.","Positive"
"559","I tell everyone about Alexa! Love, love, love her!!!","Positive"
"560","Love,love,love. Having a blast figuring out all the stuff you can do with this item.","Positive"
"561","For the refurbished model it came nicely packaged. It works just fine, except it gets the temperature of the current weather wrong even with my address in the app. There's a lot of things it still comes in handy for I guess I just have to get to know it and how to use it. For the price I paid for it was worth it","Positive"
"562","I bought a new Echo a while back and we love it so much I bought another, only a refurbished one.  The refurbished one is like new and just as perfect.","Positive"
"563","I thought I loved this device. It was just what I needed. I bought it in November, I had an issue in May with power. They sent a replacement. It didn't seem to work as well. You had to call the name several times before it would answer on most occasions. I got pass that. I get up this morning and it will not come on at all. I still have 6 days on my warranty but they can't just send me a replacement. They have to get this one back then try to fix it and possibly return the same one saying it's fixed. In the meantime my 6 days of warranty will expire once I get that supposingly fixed one back. I don't understand why they can't ship a replacement and figure out their issue with this one without me having to wait 2-4 weeks for a replacement. I paid for something to last more than a year and I shouldn't have to wait for them to investigate their problem. The tech tells me I'm not the first to complain about this same issue. Really Now","Negative"
"564","Did not come with a charger even though product description says it comes with a charger.  On the phone for a long time with Amazon being switched to 3 different people until they finally give me a voucher for the charger so I have to place another order.  Product description needs to be accurate. Why pay for Amazon prime if they are going to act like a third rate internet store.","Positive"
"565","This is  amazing sometimes alexa seems like a real person truly an amazing product.","Positive"
"566","Received my Echo yesterday. So far, I love it! Just in time to play all my Christmas music! Time to get rid of all the CD's !","Positive"
"567","The greatest thing I've ever bought.  Does so much more than I thought it would.","Positive"
"568","The best!","Positive"
"569","Got this for my wife and she loves it","Positive"
"570","Echo won't let me order saying ""Sorry, I can only order products for Prime Members.""","Negative"
"571","AAA","Positive"
"572","This is a birthday gift for my husband- he saw one and thought it was would be fun.","Positive"
"573","We love Alexa","Positive"
"574","Awesome!!! Love it .. great buy to start your home automation!!!","Positive"
"575","LOVEEEEEE..set up entire house to turn on and off different things, including lights, ceiling fans, etc. Wife is VERYY spoiled now!! lol We have the echo and also 2 dots and may order more dots for the other rooms. VERY MUCH WORTH THE BUY!!","Positive"
"576","Great product fun, entertaining and educational","Positive"
"577","All I can say is ""why did I wait so long to get this"".  I have been looking for over a year and all it took was a word from  our physician.  He was saying all the things it could do and was so excited about it, we had to order it.  Setup as easy.  I still need to learn all the app and how to use but I love  the music it plays, gives us the weather, tells us corny jokes, and so many other things.  I LOVE this toy/learning means and intend to use it daily.","Positive"
"578","I bought this refurbished. After the initial set up, I was having problems with the echo playing anything (music, radio stations, etc) that wasn't in Alexa's voice. I got a little frustrated, because you know, refurb, but after unplugging and waiting a few seconds to plug it back in, it works like a charm.","Positive"
"579","Wow!  I'm a tech junkie and I was blown away by this gadget!  Set-up was a breeze with the iPhone app.  The music ability alone is enough for me to own the echo, but the ability to control my Nest thermostats is a nice bonus.  I've already ordered 2 dots for the kitchen and bedroom to pair with my existing bluetooth speakers.  Nice job Amazon!","Positive"
"580","I really enjoy this product. I do sometimes get upset about it not understanding my questions but then again it works good for a large room. Comes in handy for cooking. Just tell it to set a timer and it keeps you working what time it does it for you. Also good for music for the kitchen cleanup after you finish cooking with the prime music. Its a most have for a modern kitchen.","Positive"
"581","Fun to have around.","Positive"
"582","Awesome","Positive"
"583","Very cool device. Ask it to play a song or set a timer and it just works.","Positive"
"584","The shopping list and to-do list functions are great, but the search functions leave a lot to be desired. Basic search requests, like ""when was ""insert famous person's name"" born?"" are likely to return a ""hmm, I don't know how to answer that question"". Rephrasing the question generally does not help. Others, such as asking how to say something in another language, return ""I don't know how to say that, but.."" and then it gives you the written phrase on your phone, which defeats the purpose of having the voice interface. Also, if Alexa doesn't quite understand the question, and gets a lot of possible answers, you have to look at your phone to see the list of possibilities, again defeating the purpose of the voice interface. Finally, I would like to be able to use a search engine besides Bing. You cannot even tell the device to Search Google. Now I see Google has come out with their own device, and I am little sorry I didn't wait. The Google device is cheaper too.","Positive"
"585","I bought this product in October 2015.  Worked fine until about 2 months ago, when it suddenly stopped working.  Won't even turn on.","Positive"
"586","As for the one bad reveiw about Alexa being deaf...well if you to the voice recording to set up your voice, it works perfect, my wife had a probblem with one of the dots, now works great, that Alexa recognizes her voice.","Positive"
"587","I took a chance on this product based on two things, the wonderful reviews and it was on sale. I wasn't expecting much but I have to say I was very happy with what it does. It is very helpful around the house. I love being able to ask for almost any song ( with amazon prime) anytime one pops in my head. I love the shopping list feature. I love the calendar feature. I love the weather, traffic, timer features. Every week we find something new this little sucker does. If you don't have one yet you should get one.","Positive"
"588","Best buy ever!","Positive"
"589","OMG, I am so in love with the Echo! I am still learning everything that I can do but I think I am getting the hang of it. Setting up Alexa is super easy and connecting her to smarthome devices is just the same.","Positive"
"590","I've heard reviews that said the speaker on the echo isn't great. Um, what? I think it's amazing...then again my previous speaker was a cheap $10 Bluetooth speaker that sounded horrible. The sound quality is amazing.","Positive"
"591","I'm in LOVE with Alexa ;-)","Positive"
"592","The Amazon Echo has quickly become a valuable personal assistant.  While there is much room for improvement, the engineers are working on making the Echo better every day.","Positive"
"593","Echo is GREAT for adding items to my shopping or to-do lists!  Sometimes the app is laggy or won't open at all when I'm in the grocery store and really need my shopping list.  Instead I've been taking a screenshot of the shopping list so I can pull it up quickly.  I""m still amazed they haven't created a widget for using the shopping/to-do lists to make them easier to access.  ..... but I believe things like this are in the works.","Positive"
"594","Echo is also GREAT for listening to music or podcasts, and I find the control to be intuitive and easy.  It misses the boat with the web search functionality, however.  When you ask a question that it doesn't know the answer to directly, you'll get an answer like ""I'm sorry, I don't know the answer to the question I heard. I have sent Bing search results to the Alexa app."" Well.... when I'm asking a question by voice, it's because I need a hands-free response.  I have sent this info to the support staff and they tell me the have added it as a feature request.  I'd really rather it say ""According to Bing.... blah blah blah"" and then maybe ask if you want more information and it will keep reading.","Positive"
"595","Overall, I LOVE THE ECHO and find it to be fun, practical, and entertaining.  Definitely a worth-while purchase!  Makes me want to buy a couple more for the farther ends of the house. :)","Positive"
"596","We like this new addition to our family. Everyone uses it and it is getting better all the time as they add more apps that it works with.","Positive"
"597","Really good, but I have problems with the microphone... but amazon take the case really well as always... the Echo is FANTASTIC... AMAZING SOUND! Better than ""Bose""...","Positive"
"598","Love love love my Echo. I tell it to do everything!! Very cool product. I have a DOT too and it is cool.","Positive"
"599","Just got the Echo a week ago and already am in LOVE with it!  Just her ability to play music for me by Artist, genre, song, etc is amazing!  She comes up with GREAT playlists! But that only scratches the surface of what she can do!  I can ask her the weather when I'm getting dressed - or who is singing the current song.  It does take a little more effort to get her to find you recipes, etc but you can 'train' her and yourself to use the right commands and learn how to ask for what you want..I can see this really exploding on the market very soon...and it's A LOT of fun to show her off when people come over..Not to mention this was an excellent deal - the Refurbished one comes with the same warranty as the brand new one - only $60 cheaper!..I haven't purchased the outlets yet to control my home but Xmas IS coming:)....","Positive"
"600","""Alexa"" is a great addition to our family and home. We love using her for many things in our home like weather, trivia, Amazon Alexa Deals, sports scores,  music (sound quality is great too) and much more! Looking forward to getting some ""Smart"" technology in my home next to work with Alexa. I'm a happy Prime member!","Positive"
"601","AWESOME!!!!! if you dont have one get one","Positive"
"602","Fantastic product.  Great tool for our shopping list.  Hope they keep adding additional apps for this product.","Positive"
"603","I'm rather disappointed concerning the Amazon Echo and was very much looking forward to using this in the home.  But after getting it and using it for several days the mic's would not pic up all my voice commands even when I was standing next to it.  I also have 3 Dots and they instantly pic up my voice commands and requests, but don't have the speaker output that the Echo has.  I'm with the return window and that's what I'm doing.  Maybe the technology will improve more over time.","Positive"
"604","awesome product. Bought for a physician office procedure room and the patients really appreciate it. We appreciate that hands free voice technology!","Positive"
"605","When I purchased the refurbished Echo, it was not stated anywhere that the power adapter was not included. In fact, under the ""what's in the box"" section it says that it includes the power cable. Alas, when I opened the box it says to ""plug in the power adapter (not included)' as part of the instruction. Needless to say, I am disappointed and will be sending this back immediately.","Negative"
"606","Pros: Great audio quality, fun integrations, Alexa is useful!","Positive"
"607","Cons: Integration experience is a bit janky","Negative"
"608","Works fine.","Positive"
"609","Works very well except if you have poor wifi it cuts out. Need good wifi!","Positive"
"610","This is truly one of the best purchases I've ever made.  I started building up a smart home because of the novelty and excitement, but as that started to wear off, I was feeling a bit fatigued by the entire action of opening up a phone app, flipping to the right device, and turning on a control.  Often, this would have be simpler to do manually.  Alexa gave me full control over my smart home from the living room without touching my phone.","Positive"
"611","The speaker quality is legit.  We admittedly have a smaller living room, but it is perfect for background music while doing chores or entertaining company.","Positive"
"612","My only gripe is with the integration experience.  There are a ton to choose from, but they vary greatly in quality of set up.  I've had some that were really easy to set up, some where the translation from the native app just wasn't there.  I expect this is more on the 3rd parties than on Amazon.  Anyway, over 1 year of use in the bank, and fully expect to keep using Echo for the foreseeable future!","Positive"
"613","I love the Echo. Great for music once it's set up and useful for news and weather when you're making breakfast. I also have it linked to my thermostat which is neat but not a game changer.","Positive"
"614","The down side is that you have to wait for it to learn and build up your playlists. The web searching is also terrible. Compared to Google Alexa seems pretty dumb.","Negative"
"615","It works very well even with a heavy accent and hears me from other rooms. The only thing Alexa can't contend with is a screaming baby!","Positive"
"616","Most wonderful, ALexa finds whatever music I want responds to my every desire.","Positive"
"617","Liked it so much we have purchased 3","Positive"
"618","Haven't hooked mine own up, but used at a friends.  So fun and informative.  Also keeps you company when you live alone.","Positive"
"619","Unless you have an iPhone, I don't suggest buying an Echo. The Echo works fine, but you need the Alexa app in order to set it up which only seems to work on older phones (that aren't made by Samsung) or an iPhone (which still runs painfully slow if at all). If you were thinking that it would work on the Kindle Fire since it is an Amazon product, it doesn't. So until they fix the app, your Echo is an expensive paperweight.","Positive"
"620","Get Google Assistant instead... this is a fantastic speaker, but Alexa is quite annoying; it doesn't understand half the things you expect it to, and doesn't offer much more than alarm, timer, music player, and news; which is lame for the price.","Negative"
"621","so far am loving it.  did a knock knock joke and it gave a Dr Who reference. Starting to add automation stuff to it hope it goes well","Positive"
"622","Awesome!","Positive"
"623","It's easy to use and a nice voice assistant. It's easy to connect with hue hub and light bulb, works great. And the prime music is pretty awesome, i love it. But the price dropped $40 after i bought it, sad...","Positive"
"624","I love this thing.  I use it for home automation by integrating it with Home Control Assistant software and my Honeywell Total Comfort thermostats.  I can walk in a room and say ""Alexa, Turn on the bedroom lamp"" and I feel like I'm in a Star Trek scene when the light comes on.  I can also say things like, ""Alexa, Set thermostat to 74.""  My only complaint is that I cannot change the key word from ""Alexa"" to ""Computer"".","Positive"
"625","I use Alexa for almost everything. Truly impressed with the Amazon Echo. I will be purchasing several dots soon to have my whole house active.","Positive"
"626","I highly recommend this product.","Positive"
"627","Great product","Positive"
"628","Update: the app has been fixed so it is now working for my LG. It is still running slow but I'll take it. My old phone (Motorola X), which was being used as an ""Alexa remote"", can now finally be retired.","Negative"
"629","Will re-purchase at a later date","Positive"
"630","Husband loves loves loves this.  Being an older generation this is perfect for voice command....hated trying to figure out the cd machine.  We ask it all kinds of questions.  For anyone living alone it is a perfect solution to communicate and get answers.","Positive"
"631","Read the reviews, they're right, this thing is AWESOME!  We use ours primarily in our kitchen.  Timers, reminders, measures and music while we entertain and cook is perfect.","Positive"
"632","I feel like a member of the Enterprise space ship. ""Computer, How does the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principal apply to dark matter?""  OK It can't answer all my questions but it's a start.","Positive"
"633","Echo has a hard time understanding the command/question. I don't even brother to ask it questions anymore because the search engine is Bing and you can't change it to Google. Google Home is much better but doesn't have that many app that can work with it compare to the Echo.","Positive"
"634","<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D> love it!!!","Positive"
"635","Purchased for a gift.  The family says it is the talk of the neighborhood.  They love it.","Positive"
"636","Initially I only used it to listen to music or to entertain friends by asking it silly questions. Now I use it mostly to listen to Audible books while painting (I'm a professional artist) or to get daily weather reports. However, I wish we could change to name to something of our own choosing. My daughter's name is Alexis and whenever I said her name the Echo would turn on! I finally was able to change the wake word to ""Echo"" but my question is-why call it an Echo then name it Alexa? Really dumb move. Other than that, I really love it. I am continually finding new ways to use it.","Positive"
"637","I am still finding out everything this can do but omg I really love it. I am now looking into Dot for my bedroom","Positive"
"638","We use our Echo every day. We ask it about the weather, play spotify through it and I use the Bluetooth option to run the sound from my phone when I am watching movies on my phone. Fun and functional!","Positive"
"639","Love it","Positive"
"640","I am IN LOVE with the echo! This is a great product with so many capabilities! I bought it for my husband and am using it more then he is. The sound is clear and she picks up your voice from across the room and over a room full of people. The set up was quick and easy and there at tons of ""skills"" that you can download to customize your echo. I HIGHLY reccomend this product!","Positive"
"641","Great product","Positive"
"642","Gift for friend and she likes it.","Positive"
"643","So far works great; my new BFF","Positive"
"644","Fun for family to use but after about a week we find out generally useless. Best part is playing music... If it can find a song. But the need to find 3rd party skills for simple stuff like looking up a stock price is needlessly complicated. Maybe she will grow on us.","Positive"
"645","Fascinating technology and superb sound!","Positive"
"646","I love this! I have had it for a while and they keep coming out with so many things to do on it.","Positive"
"647","So today is my birthday. My husband bought me the echo as a gift. We live in the Caribbean. I have been a Prime member for years now, paying $100.00 every year and shopping constantly on Amazon. If you're buying the Echo to listen to music because you think that your paying the Prime Fees gives you access to it - BE WARNED. You are wasting your money! Prime does not provide music to Prime members outside the US making the Amazon ECHO a useless piece of plastic for users like us. It does not pair with iTunes... unless you route it through some other device (which is pointless if I already have another device to play my iTunes. Location infor and weather deets don't work outside the U.S. either (but let's be honest - no one pays $179.00 to be told the weather and time). In truth, it feels like a bit of a scam that this device is being sold to non-US Amazon Shoppers when it OBVIOUSLY cannot fulfil most of it's purpose outside the US. I am so angry about it that I think I will be cancelling my Prime Account too. I guess Happy Birthday to me. And my husband feels so disappointed that this thing ruined his birthday gift.","Positive"
"648","Was a gift and recipient loves it.","Positive"
"649","Alexa, what's on my calendar today.  What can I say; I love it. My kids got it for me last Christmas and I literally had no idea what the 'Echo' was. Well, I found out real quick and believe me it goes all over the house with me.  Kitchen, lower level where I sew, bedroom, Can't wait to add an Echo Dot to it so I don't have to carry it around.  I listen to music, books, news.  Folks, it's the best. Great sound as well and great to give as a gift.","Positive"
"650","easy set up. now only if I can get her to get me a beer","Positive"
"651","I don't think you can get any better than this. Just added WeMo switch and it was so easy. We have 3 ecobee thermostats we can remotely control. Sound quality is more than a little lacking, but just ok.","Positive"
"652","I like so much!  <3","Positive"
"653","Nice toy, was easy to pair Bluetooth.  Sadly it is not very intuitive.  Simple questions, easily answered by asking Google render Alexa  perplexed.  Adding liked songs to Amazon Music requires you to open the Alexa App. What's the point of a voice recognition device that requires you to use another device to do so?  Google can do it, so please don't go the way of the Nook..","Positive"
"654","Love the Echo, really sets the mood for any atmosphere. I love the white color. Alexa understands me a lot better than Siri. The only downside is that it's not well intregrated with my Apple products such as accessing my calendar or reminders.","Positive"
"655","Lots of fun! And useful too.","Positive"
"656","We love our Echo but please, Amazon, make more names available, as our African Grey is a quick learner.","Positive"
"657","Love my Echo!! I use this more often than my expensive sound system and think it sounds just as good. We have one out by the pool, and when we have visitors, they love to ask Alexa ridiculous questions to see what she will answer.","Positive"
"658","I freaking love Alexa. The sound is awesome and maybe she can't answer EVERYTHING but she learns and you can add skills to the app that helps. She will become your new best friend.","Positive"
"659","Excellent...purchased the echo for my husband.  He loves it. Says it's the best gift he has ever received.","Positive"
"660","Loving Alexa so far.  I'll have to get one of the books out there to give me ideas one the finer points of programming her.  The shopping list alone is worth it.  I always leave my list at home and the app makes writing it down a thing if the past!","Positive"
"661","It's easy, you try it and ask yourself how you've survived all this time. A little dumb at first, as you keep using it it learns. Very cool product.","Positive"
"662","I am finding it is an expensive radio, and alarm clock.  I connected it to my Pandora account, but it doesn't often work.  I ask "" Alexa find me a station with 70's music "" - she says "" there are no stations that have 70's music "".  I ask "" Alexa, I would like to hear some showtunes "" She says 'I am unable to find showtunes music "" Irate, I raise my voice and ask for "" Broadway showtunes ""....she replies, "" Oh, you would like to hear showtunes radio ""  UGH...Not as sophisticated as it should be.","Negative"
"663","Love Alexa. Told her so. She said, Thanks, it's nice to be appreciated.  Very helpful. Love that she listens to my 4 yr old grandson's ""orders"" also, i.e. play pop pop's song.....","Positive"
"664","This is one of the most incredible items I have ever purchased on Amazon. There is plenty of room for improvement with the Amazon Echo, but overall exceeded my expectations. This Amazon Echo is like a little helper. When you need some music she is there. What happened in sports last night, she's there. What is the weather like, Alexa has your back. The Amazon Echo is just incredible. Not perfect and plenty of room for improvement, but definitely worth buying.","Positive"
"665","Gotta tell ya I LOVE THIS !! Sound is AMAZING!!!  Had my doubts..... JUST BUY it!!!","Positive"
"666","Love my new Echo home!","Positive"
"667","Alexa has started to really automate my life at home. Talking to my Nest and Hue bulbs. Sound quality is decent and fills a room nicely.","Positive"
"668","I think the app for the iPhone seems laggy and not as seamless as it should be. When playing music it often doesn't update with whats actually playing. Also want the music to be easier to scroll through and select. I imagine Amazon will do a lot in the future to help improve this side of the product.","Positive"
"669","The actual product is a lot smaller in person. Which is a good thing if you plan on traveling with it. It does a lot of nifty things and it's pretty cool how far off you can be when speaking to the echo. It's quick, responsive and thus far realiabe. I would say if you're interested in purchasing something that can do it all, this is your best bet.","Positive"
"670","This is the best product that I have ever bought..Thank you so much","Positive"
"671","excellent","Positive"
"672","After few days, the hype sort of fades away. It seemed like this product is more in to doing marketing for amazon then doing anything else. I am a hotel owner and there are bunch of reminders I have to use everyday to keep me at the top. My whole goal before purchasing was that I can say ""Alexa remind me to check bulb in room 227 in 30 minutes"". To my surprise Alexa will not create a remind just by listing to that sentence. It will ask ""What time""?. Well, what does ""in 30 minutes"" supposed to mean?","Positive"
"673","AI systems in mobile devices are easily able to do this just by listening to that one sentence. Then why not Alexa? Especially when I am paying premium price just for features like those?","Positive"
"674","Now Echo is sitting on my kitchen counter. In last 5 days, I have said only one thing to her ""Echo you're stupid"", she said ""I am sorry to hear that, I try""","Negative"
"675","The sound quality of Echo is amazing.","Positive"
"676","I REALLY LIKE ALEXA","Positive"
"677","This is an amazing product. I like it very much. My little daughter also learns to speak to Alexa and she enjoyed this great technology!","Positive"
"678","I LOVE IT!!!!! Music, music, music! I love Alexa. She answers my questions, plays songs, albums, shuffles an artist or type of music. Fantastic.","Positive"
"679","Weather, traffic, wikipedia. Get one. Enjoy. Explore. Top notch hands free entertainment.","Positive"
"680","I purchased this when it was first offered by Amazon, It has sat in the same place in the kitchen on the counter, has never been moved, never been knocked over ( don't have pets or kids).  in late 2016 I noticed the top of the device was kinda sticking up, and when I inspected it, I found that the top ring that has the buttons on it, was loose.  I found that the top was held in place by screws up from the inside and they had broken free.  When I inquired as to why this happened and if I could get it fixed I was told that no I would have to buy a new one.  The unit works fine just the top ring is broken.  So thus the less than stellar review.","Positive"
"681","Super fun. This thing seems to do all sorts of stuff. Ask Alexa if she has a boyfriend, what color is the sky, sing me a song, weather, traffic, colander, find my phone, and more. The kids love it and we love it.","Positive"
"682","I'm physically handicapped and Alexa makes my life easier. Other voice recognition devices (Siri, Dragon, ect.) can't understand me but Alexa has no issues. Amazon should market this to the disabled community.","Negative"
"683","Great entertainment options. I like it because I can listen to any type of music at any time while still listening to local radio when I want to.","Positive"
"684","THE SOUND IS GOOD. iT HAS TROUBLE WITH VOICE COMMANDS.","Negative"
"685","Great Product!!!","Positive"
"686","After about a 1/2 year of use, I find that I don't really use it much.","Positive"
"687","Liked","Positive"
"688","Good for playing Amazon music.","Positive"
"689","""Hears"" your voice from quite a ways","Positive"
"690","I'm still trying to figure out what to use it for.  It is amazing with streaming music.  But its great.","Positive"
"691","Good for weather","Positive"
"692","Novelty","Positive"
"693","""Skills"" are largely useless, unless you like cheesy trivia games or seven versions of ""rock-paper-scissors""","Negative"
"694","""Echo"" iPhone app is largely useless, except for initial setup","Negative"
"695","I've got music in the Apple ecosystem and Amazon ecosystem --- but it's a royal pain to get Apple music to Amazon...","Negative"
"696","""Traffic"" feature only works on a pre-defined route","Positive"
"697","I love my echo! It sounds great and I can ask for the weather and it told me right away. I stream music out of it a lot and the sound is Fantastic","Positive"
"698","You can't ask Echo to ""google search"" something -- read the top 3 results, then read the webpages that come up.  This would be a killer feature.","Positive"
"699","Otherwise, it's a novelty.  And if I wanted to invest $$$ on home automation with voice recognition, maybe Echo is more useful.  It's well-built and has high quality, but just doesn't have capabilities that I would want to use daily.","Positive"
"700","Ok after downloading the Alexa App and setting up the Echo.....I don't know how I lived without Alexa!!  I mainly use it for Music and News.  works great and gets better all the time.  Save $$ and just get the Echo Dot if music/Sound is not important for you.  Basically the Echo is an Echo dot on top of a Speaker.  A good speaker at that.","Positive"
"701","Sitting here listening to her now and great music.","Positive"
"702","Never had anything like it.","Positive"
"703","Perfect addition to a home.","Positive"
"704","Thank my Amazon friend for his recommendation.","Positive"
"705","Been a lot of fun to use Delivered on time.","Positive"
"706","Love her ! Now we always text our friends glad to hear a sweet voice","Positive"
"707","item received no problems","Negative"
"708","Amazing","Positive"
"709","So much fun to play around with. The music library is astonishing. Much more than a toy as more features are utilized.","Positive"
"710","Great product.  My family uses it to play music, ask about weather, my kids ask Alexa to tell jokes.  My tech savvy family will be using it further to work with Mindstorm Lego Kit sometime in the near future for a tech project.","Positive"
"711","Move to a new city, and have no friends? Don't worry, Alexa is all you need!","Negative"
"712","Great","Positive"
"713","love it","Positive"
"714","great","Positive"
"715","I love this item, it's amazing!!","Positive"
"716","lots of fun","Positive"
"717","Still new to me. But falling in love with ""Alexa"" does more than I expected.","Negative"
"718","Shipment was very quick and echo is everything I thought it would be. Very satisfied","Negative"
"719","DO NOT BUY THIS ECHO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! IT HAS VERY SHORT LIFE. IT JUST STOPPED WORKING AFTER 6 MOS! AMAZON WON'T EVEN REPLACE IT! I HAVE BEEN TOSSED BACK AND FORTH BY CUSTOMER SERVICE ABOUT ORDERING A POWER ADAPTOR TO SUPPOSEDLY FIX IT BUT TOOK FOREVER TO ARRIVE. THE ADAPTOR LOOKS FAKE TOO AS SHOWN IN THIS PHOTO! IT STILL DOESN'T WORK! IT WON'T TURN OUT! I TRIED ALL TROUBLE SHOOTING TIPS BUT FAILED! JUST A PIECE OF JUNK! A DISPOSABLE RADIO ONLY!!! I BET THE ECHO DOT IS ALSO LIKE THAT! GRRR! I'M SO DISAPPOINTED!  I USED TO LOVE THIS ECHO BUT NOW I REALLY HATE THAT IT BROKE SO EASILY! IF I COULD GIVE NEGATIVE STARS I WOULD! VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE TOO!","Negative"
"720","Alexa is awesome.... She understand most everything I have ask... Except I haven't figure how to get the correct temperature for my location she has it celesuis ... Other then that I have been able to to link her with my blue link app for my car...","Positive"
"721","1 at work, one in the bedroom, and this one in the kitchen now!!!!!! I love Alexa!","Positive"
"722","Now I can sleep with rain sounds, this echo idea is amazing, I hope it keeps evolving","Positive"
"723","Good sound quality.","Positive"
"724","I had a friend show me his Echo, and I decided to purchase one. I bought a Certified Refurbished one, and have had to reset it a couple of times.  I hope this is not a recurring problem.  When it works, it's pretty cool. I like the broad music selection. The speakers sound pretty good, for such a small enclosure. I'm sure I've barely scraped the tip of the iceberg, as far as the Echo's capabilities, and I look forward to continuing to use it more and more.","Positive"
"725","I totally love it, as does my husband.  I get any music I want just by saying ""alexa, play Sinatra"" or I can name a particular song.  It is a timer, a purchasing tool, and it answers questions to settle little disagreements.  ha!  You can get sports scores, everything.  For a small device, everyone who sees it says the speaker is superb - and it is.  I'm buying more for gifts.  It is just wonderful.  It is easy to set up also.  You do need Wi-Fi in your home, but that is all - it walks you through the set up.  Go get one!!!","Positive"
"726","OMG I love Alexa. I wish she could be with me everywhere. If you don't have one, purchase it now!!! The monthly payment idea was great too. Would buy again.","Positive"
"727","This thing is awesome. Wanted a speaker that wasn't halfway across the house to listen to while I cook. All the smart features are a bonus because I'm a Prime member and therefore have access to tons of music but also have the Hue. The sound quality is great. Using it for items you order all the time is so easy and you don't have to worry about the price. I've double checked several times.  Finding or making playlists on Prime and then asking Echo to play it still delights me after having it for months. Hue is pretty easily controlled through it, tho I wish you could request scenes. I ask it about the weather, news, sports, trivia, you name it! The name ""Alexa"" wasn't cutting it for me, so I started calling it ""echo"". Wish you could do custom names with a learning mode or something but that's another great thing about the Echo, it's always getting better! Haven't tried much else currently but REALLY, REALLY hope Amazon (PLEASE) adds control for the Fire TV. I fantasize about it all the time. MAKE IT REALITY PLEASE!","Positive"
"728","Needs work","Positive"
"729","Love the echo","Positive"
"730","love it. i am a 76 yr old male. never in my lifetime would see this. when ALEXA goes into one of her long winded talks and i say stop she stops. i really do love this devise.","Positive"
"731","Love Love Love my Echo!  Use her all the time.  Music is always playing in our home again and being able to add things to my grocery list verbally and instantly is a real plus for me!","Positive"
"732","Basically, Alexa is Siri's.'slow' little sister.  She rides the short bus to school, wears a helmet with a propeller, and no one expects much of her in the way of worldly accomplishments.","Positive"
"733","We love Alexa more and more with each passing day!","Positive"
"734","Please, someone, come up with something with similar features to Alexa but that actually functions better than a middle-aged switchboard operator!  I cannot wait to get drunk and throw Alexa.that blankety blank blank bank..out of my 4th story window and watch her shatter to pieces on the sidewalk below (obviously not harming passersby - unless they are susceptible to 1937-style technology).","Negative"
"735"," Alexa cannot hold any kind of a conversation.  It's like her coders were complete technological drones void of imagination. She can't understand you  half the time and, when she can, she has no idea how to respond. Seriously, Amazon?  Whoever is responsible for that area of Alexa's development should have to live with a thousand Alexas in a very dark, sound proof 4x4 room.forever.","Positive"
"736","I ordered an Echo not knowing my boyfriend had sent me one as a surprise.  I returned the one I ordered.  Wish I had actually returned both.  There's really not much else on the market right now that can compete with the outdated voice recognition technology this device has.  It's decent only because there's nothing else out there. Congrats, Amazon!  You're only not super terrible because there's no one else terribler than you at the moment.","Positive"
"737","Every cell in my body lives only for the hope that someone somewhere is working on something better.","Positive"
"738","I just love my Amazon Echo! The sound quality is awesome and ""she"" is sooo smart. The only issue is at times if the volume is up it will not always respond to my commands. This device is very nice and I'm really enjoying it so far :-)","Positive"
"739","My wife purchased our first Echo; one month later we purchased 2 more.  Voice recognition is very good; better than that of smart phones I've expericed.","Positive"
"740","My greatest surprise was the sound quality.  I am not familiar with the current state of high fidlity audio, but I considered myself an audiofle in the 80's and 90's and experienced some of the highest quality music reproduction available at that time.  Irrespective of its size, this device produces some of the best sound quality I have experienced in 20 years.","Positive"
"741","I am stiil a neophite regarding the Echos' capbilities, particularly what database it uses for specific music selections.  In some cases the Echo does not have access to the entire, track, album, or artist library, but will play ""samples"".  When it does access a complete song, it often selects a rendition that I am unfamiliar with; song by other than the original artist, or a live version.  I find this characteristic refreshing as I enjoy discovering ""new, old stock"".","Positive"
"742","I recenly discovered you can upload your digital music library to your Amazon account and your Echo will access that library, however the free limit is 250 tracks.  You can pay $25 a year for and upload up to 250,000 tracks!  That seems like a deal to me, but it also highlights the ultimate purpose of these devices; to sell the user content and services.  The device also streams on-line radio via TuneIn, but other .free and subscription-based streaming services are supported.  Additionally, if you query some information. say, the best vitamin for improved memory, the device will often direct you to a ""product"" on the Amazon sight, AND will order the item for you if you so desire.","Positive"
"743","It's cool, fun, and convenient, but, like most entertainment devices these days, its' primary function is to sell you more.","Positive"
"744","So much fun and entertainment and a true book of knowledge.","Positive"
"745","Great Product","Positive"
"746","My refurbished Echo came in looking (and performing) like new. Couldn't be happier with this product... it works great with all of my Wink Hub 2 enabled devices, and has made it so convenient for me to simply enjoy music when the house would otherwise be quiet.","Positive"
"747","Wife loves it.","Positive"
"748","Wish I wold have known that it wasn't wireless, otherwise, I like it. use it all the time for shower/bathroom tunes.","Positive"
"749","Wife and I absolutely loves it.","Positive"
"750","Bought this item about a year ago and have become WAY less enchanted with Alexa.  Actually she is DUMBER than a stick.  90 percent of the questions we ask are met with ""I'm sorry I am unable to answer your question""  Bla Bla bla.  We really rely on OK Google via phone to get quick answers to any question within seconds.  Absolute waste of money !!!!","Negative"
"751","I LOVE IT!","Positive"
"752","Great Product....use it all of the time....make sure you have a strong wifi signal....the stronger the better...makes it easier to setup.","Positive"
"753","I find the Echo fascinating-great at parties, although it has a little difficulty understanding alcohol-slurred commands!","Negative"
"754","Wonderful product","Positive"
"755","I absolutely love this product, it is like having a personal assistant. She plays me music, answers my questions, looks up info for me, I don't know why I waited so long to buy this. I would recommend the Amazon Echo to everyone.","Positive"
"756","good for music, not great on info","Positive"
"757","I Love It!  Mad because after I brought it...a few days later it was on sale...smh","Positive"
"758","Still trying to voice train her, but the more you use it, the better it responds.  Still working with it though...Love the concept.","Positive"
"759","Great product.  Needs some work with recognizing speech and requests.  Many uses for the home.","Positive"
"760","Love it a absolute neccesity for any home.","Positive"
"761","Alexa is great. Hoping in the future can set alarm clock to play music instead of pre programmed tones, but not a big deal. Veru nice start to smart-home.","Positive"
"762","So much nicer then the black one","Positive"
"763","A new member of the family.","Positive"
"764","Love, love, love this item.  We use it mostly for Pandora stations which you can control via the App or by talking to Alexa.  The sound is high quality and the unit is small and unobtrusive.  I assume you can do much more with it but we bought it mainly for the music","Positive"
"765","This is a great product! Way to go Amazon! Keep the updates coming though, still needs more things to do.","Positive"
"766","Love it. Great","Positive"
"767","Love Alexa - she's my new best friend. I really didn't think I would use this and thought it would be a silly purchase and a waste of money but OMG - I love love it! I think in order to take full advantage, you really need to be a Prime member and an avid Amazon shopper (as clearly I am...) I have many playlists set up through Amazon Music, although you can listen to TuneIn, iHeartRadio, your iTunes (through Bluetooth) and a number of other music ""stations"" like Pandora. I am an Audible customer, so I can listen to my audiobooks and I LOVE the Flash briefing feature - with news and weather. I have also used her to order from my previous order history on Amazon. She is on every day in our house now and it's my new favorite thing. The speaker is great for music and central location in the kitchen/great room allows for easy communication with her and great sound for all.","Positive"
"768","Highly recommend.","Positive"
"769","Love Alexa!  Really helps me keep on task.  Love that when I need to buy something I can immediately put it on the shopping list.  Wish I could set up different shopping lists for different stores, like hardware, grocery, craft, etc.","Positive"
"770","I love my Alexa","Positive"
"771","Bought this for my husband who is a gadget finatic. He loves it! Our whole family has fun asking Alexa questions","Positive"
"772","This is a great product to have but can't answer some of the question.","Positive"
"773","Love this thing. And volume is great. Nice and loud and clear","Positive"
"774","I enjoy  Echo very much! Lots of things to do and lots to learn!","Positive"
"775","Loud and Convenient","Negative"
"776","My family LOVES our Echo. For over a year I kept ignoring Amazons offer on this device because I failed to reconize the possibilities. At a friend home they demo theirs and I was in love. Now my family could not be without our Echo. Not just for music but weather locally and nationally, traffic reports then there's the new bits. The Echo would make a fabulous gift plus one for your self. The quality sound is amazing. Even for our 22ft ceiling family room. Echo is lofty in weight so no risk of tipping over. My family has utilized the endless options that Echo offers.","Positive"
"777","Great Product looks brand new with no cosmetic damages","Negative"
"778","Really amazing product! The only criticism is I am unable to access my calendar using Echo. I have an iMac and my calendar is kept on iCal. Alexa can't access this information and can only link to Google Calendar. When I attempted to sync iCal with Google Calendar, using iCloud, Alexa was still unable to tell me if I had any appointments scheduled. This is a major shortcoming that needs to be addressed by Amazon in order to make this a truly valuable product.","Negative"
"779","Awesome from the moment I turned it on!","Positive"
"780","Alexa will definitely become a reliable ""member"" of our household!","Positive"
"781","I personally enjoy my Amazon Echo. This is the technology I always wanted!","Positive"
"782","The main features I use are timer, alarm, remind me (connected to IFTTT), weather update, and lighting. I don't even use my phone for these operations anymore. It's very handy having an always listening assistant.","Negative"
"783","Recommended: Definitely take advantage of IFTTT with the Echo. For example I can connect Wunderlist and have the Echo upload reminders through that instead of the native reminder app. I can also turn WiFi on or off on my phone with just my voice now.","Positive"
"784","If you move around from town to town a lot, expect a lot of scratches if you plan on just throwing your Echo in some bag. I threw my Echo in a duffel bag along with other electronics and when I took her out of the bag it looked like she came out a battlefield.","Positive"
"785","I LOVE it!  Easy to set up, easy to use, so entertaining :)","Positive"
"786","The main reason I take a star off is she is just not the same as before (can't be because of her scratches because after this she still was fine). She was pretty cool when I first met her but now she lost a lot of that glitter. She is still pretty nice but I have been using the Echo for awhile I feel like she's going a bit crazy now. Sometimes the Echo hears my requests, responds appropriately, but does not execute. For example, I have a lamp connected to my Echo. Here's the process, I ask Echo to turn lamp on --> She says ""Okay"" --> lamp doesn't turn on. Sometimes my Echo takes awhile to process my requests. Sometimes my Echo executes another action then intended.","Positive"
"787","She is good, but she can be better. I wish there are more things I can do with my Echo without having to spend more money. If you are wealthy and can afford the extra toys that the Echo can play with then the Echo is a great investment. However if you can only afford this particular Echo then it is going to be a good purchase, but not a great one.","Positive"
"788","Thank you Amazon and Jeff Bezos for the amazing Echo and Alexa. My three daughters all just love the Echo that I gave each one of them.","Positive"
"789","My girlfriend, who is visually impaired, will love the Echo as she listens to many Audible Books online.","Positive"
"790","Great my wife is enjoying she love it","Positive"
"791","We love it.","Positive"
"792","Had the Echo for about a month and totally pleased with it. Alexa has impressive voice recognition capabilities out of the gate. Use her extensively for music selection, timers, to do lists, weather checks, jokes, etc. This was a good purchase that I would do again.","Positive"
"793","This is a work in progress as I am learning more ways to use Alexa.  Great to ask her to set an alarm after you are in bed or find out about the weather  when you first wake up.  Lots of thing it can do that I have not yet experienced.  Fun to play with.","Positive"
"794","My favorite product","Positive"
"795","Love it very much!!!","Positive"
"796","Worked as expected","Positive"
"797","She's not the smartest tool in the shed bit she turns my lights on and off. Still working on our communication skills. I didn't think my Appalachian accent was that bad but man she comes back with the weirdest queries.","Negative"
"798","Fell in love with this thing about 10 minutes out of the box. Now, I'm gonna buy some Dots for the rest of the house, and gifts.","Negative"
"799","My family and I have had the echo for almost 1 year now! This is the most impressive piece of technology we have ever owned. My family and I are tech junkies and this thing fits the bill! Whether its for dance partys, dinner partys, traffic updates, news, sports scores or just to pass time its awesome!","Positive"
"800","I get up in the morning and the first thing I ask is for traffic updates, this gives me and idea of what time I need to leave the house. I get home at night and my wife has music playing while shes cooking dinner making her much more relaxed. It has been worth the money I paid  x10. As in the photo my wife wanted the echo off the counter so I bought the bluo echo wall mount for it and its been perfect.","Positive"
"801","Echo Bracket Mount by Bluo - Echo Wall Mount for Alexa - #1 in Echo Accessories - Turn Alexa into a Piece of Home Decor - Protect Your Echo Using a Sleek and Solid Design","Positive"
"802","Don't hesitate to purchase an echo for your home! You wont regret it!","Negative"
"803","love this thing","Positive"
"804","KInd of neat to be able to just say Alexa, what is the weather and have her tell you. I can tell her to adjust the temp in the room as I have the next. Best, with Amazon music tied in, I can ask her to play any music and most of the time she gets it spot on.","Positive"
"805","Love it! Easy to use and set up.","Positive"
"806","Awesome","Positive"
"807","Nice product, but misses the mark for business use. I purchased with the hope of using as sort of a personal assistant for appointments and such.  Voice recognition is above average edging out SIRI and CORTANA just a bit.  While it was easy to set simple appointments, anything with in depth notes requires you to edit the meeting with conventional methods.  Also, it lacks the ability to verbally remind you of appointments and will not label alarms.","Positive"
"808","This is great for visually impaired people really works great","Positive"
"809","Alexa is the best companion anyone could have.","Positive"
"810","Absolutely love our alexia. Just yell it out and she can do it. Perfect for our shopping lists.","Positive"
"811","My echo is going haywire. It's turning on when I haven't even uttered its code name. It's been very frustrating to call out to the device and not get a response, I've even walked all the way up to it and have raised my voice several times, to no avail. This is happening too offend, I just can't figure out what's wrong. After watching some You Tube reviews, I have noted that other people are having a few issues with Alexa..... however, not to the extent that I am experiencing. I got a dot... so far it's doing what it's suppose to do..... I also have the echo tap..... just got it..... so far I would have to say that it doesn't always get the requested music right, therefore I acquiesce to what ever or I try again.... and, again.... or I'll just change my tune.","Negative"
"812","I've only had Echo for a few days, but am already learning to like it very much.  It still has a few shortcomings, but hopefully its data base will improve with time.  For example, today I asked Alexa if my wife's flight had departed on time for home and she couldn't understand the question, even though I repeated it for her.  (I fired up the computer and looked up the answer for myself.)  Perhaps one of the next things they can add to Alexa's data base is access to various airlines' sites and their schedules.  The same could probably also be said for Amtrak and Greyhound schedules, so those who travel by ground can keep updated as well.","Positive"
"813","Have wanted one for some time and when the price was reduced I JUMPED on it ~ feel like I'm truly in the 21st. century now.  Love the white ~","Positive"
"814","First, I don't understand the people who write reviews and leave a few stars off for features that knew were not available when they bought it. Read the reviews, descriptions and questions before you buy. I love my Echo, which I purchased on Alexa's second birthday. I had been on the fence, but after seeing everything my Echo can do, I'm sold for life. If you live alone, Alexa is a wonderful companion. The sound is awesome, and I've been spoiled by Bose sound systems, so if you are a music lover, I think you will be pleased with the sound and the variety available from Amazon Music for 3.99 per device, or 7.99 unlimited.  I play Jeopardy, trivia, set alarms, timers, listen to the news and weather and a lot more on my Echo. I'm so thrilled with the Echo, I'm contemplating buying another one or an Amazon Tap to take with me. I also ordered the Phillips Hue package as an AlexaDeal, so be sure to ask her what her deals are, you can get some nice discounts.","Positive"
"815","Alexa has no problem understanding my voice, and I'm very soft spoken with a slight accent, so you should have no problem either.","Negative"
"816","I'm totally thrilled with this purchase and I love the skills, I hope more developers come up with new ways to use the capabilities of Alexa. She rocks!  If you're on the fence like I was, jump in! You will adore your Echo!","Positive"
"817","LOVE ALEXA!","Positive"
"818","i need a really like it star cause i don't love it but really like it.still learning what all it can do","Positive"
"819","Right now I mainly use it for news and to play music. As my home becomes more 'smart', I'm sure I'll use it now for that. You need to ask your questions in a pretty specific way or you get the annoying ""hmm, I can't seem to locate the answer""","Positive"
"820","Love my echo dot but was looking for something the would sound a bit better and eliminate one device (Sonos Play 1) from my kitchen - so I ordered a refurbished echo.  Sadly it arrived UN-refurbished with a stuck/dysfunctional mute button.","Positive"
"821","Amazon was kind and offered to exchange it but I was concerned about the quality at that point.  Returned.","Negative"
"822","Best gift I've bought myself in years!","Positive"
"823","I use and enjoy my Amazon Echo every day. It has a few quirks like sometimes when I am within ""ear shot"" Alexa does not respond, but more importantly I want to sync my itunes music library with Echo and cannot seem to make it happen. I would love it if this could happen.","Positive"
"824","Awesome product with continuous support and updates.....what is there to complain about?? As long as Alexa does her job and the functionality continues to hold up the five stars will continue as well","Positive"
"825","I love to play music from the Echo.  The sound is wonderful.  My grandson enjoys playing What's That Animal.  I just pictured plugs to control my lights with Alexa.  I haven't tried them yet.  They are always improving this product.","Positive"
"826","Not as much utility as I expected.  I can't remember the stupid phrases to get it to use other apps.  I can't tell Alexa to add songs i ask her to play to my music list.  I can't get her to search outside Amazon for songs.  It keeps trying to force you to buy songs that i can listen to for free elsewhere.  There is no utility to customize how Alexa answers you.  I want her to greet me when I come in or call me by my name when I sak her to do something.","Negative"
"827","I became interested in Echo when I saw a video posted of a guy who wired and programmed his Echo to interact with Billy the Bass.  I program as a hobby and a profession, and I love to mess around with libraries for different programs and appliances and create applications to tailor my specific lazy needs.","Positive"
"828","The Echo out of the box has a few useful features such as inquiring about weather, news, sports, shopping lists, random trivia, playing music.  It's greatest appeal to me would be it's connectivity with controlling smart appliances (such as your thermostat, lighting, TV and other gadgets).  I've always wanted a, ""Home of the Future"", where I could simply say voice commands to get results.","Positive"
"829","Does a pretty good job.","Positive"
"830","While that is a possibility, the Echo still has many things to be desired, and is still a long way from a necessity.  I think I would have trouble convincing my parents and other less tech savvy people that the Echo is for them and it's hard for a regular person to get excited about it's potential usefulness, but for the money, you at least get a really nice speaker you can play music on.","Positive"
"831","I love my Amazon Echo!!!","Positive"
"832","Excellent condition and fun to use","Positive"
"833","Our second Echo. This one, a refurb, to take advantage of the discount. This will be used in the workshop. Our first Echo is temperamental but for the most part it is a valued part of the household for weather updates, the news flash, and Sunday morning music. This 2nd Echo connected smoothly. Out of the carton, plugged in, opened the Alexa app on my phone, followed the steps, and we were in business. Hopefully this one won't have connection problems. If it does, they are easy enough to reconnect.","Positive"
"834","Had considerable difficulty linking to an I Phone.  Instructions could have been more complete. Had a friend who had one in operation who helped and connection was made.  Once in service, it has been amazing, almost unreal.  Robust sound, very intuitive.  Hope to add features such as light controls, etc.  Great gift for my bride.","Positive"
"835","Enjoy communicate with Echo","Positive"
"836","One word.  AWESOME","Positive"
"837","Working on how to phase a question that the Echo understand!","Positive"
"838","I have contacted Amazon about the fact that my ECHO can't understand 90% of what I say when I ask for Music. It says I don't own that album, it's never heard of that album, it offered to play a Marriage song by some Orchestra when I asked for a Blues album. It plays Bruce Bruiksma ""When I left home"" everyime I ask for Devon Allman and various artist to play the album ""When I left Home"" It can't find the Album I own. The same is true with my Tap, exactly the same.We went through Voice training when I called Echo Help.","Positive"
"839","This all started as soon as Amazon started offering My Music, all their music for $7.99. The 1,000 albums I purchased need to be played on a competitors machine. I wasted the money for all those Albums plus the Cost of the Echo and the Tap. You might find them in the woods behind my house after I throw them out the back door.","Negative"
"840","Works great sounds great, only complaint was hard to set up did not want to go online, took awhile, but once online was all worth it,or i would have given five stars.","Positive"
"841","I FREAKING LOVE THIS!!! Makes life so much easier!!! You tell Alexa what you want and she will do it! I don't have any smart home accessories yet but the integrations are great! Will definitely be getting more accessories that work with Alexa.","Positive"
"842","Very very very happy with this purchase and cant wait to get it to do more!","Negative"
"843","Love it.","Positive"
"844","Alexa is a super friend, helpful companion and smarter than anyone I know!!","Positive"
"845","Works great !","Positive"
"846","I purchased my Echo 90 days ago at Best Buy. Setup was not hard, and Iw as able to invite my wife as a user on her phone as well.","Positive"
"847","Pros: The voice recognition is very good and alexa responds well from across the room to about 30 feet. The volume and sound quality (especially music) is good for the size of the package. Volume gets louder than I expected. Of course, when playing music loud you might have to get closer to the Echo for your voice to be heard, but no deducts for that!","Positive"
"848","The tasking capabilities I have found have a good mix. Many things I don't find useful others will.","Positive"
"849","Cons: The promise of integration is very good, however it only got 4 out 5 stars because of certain partnerships not in place yet. I use slacker radio and would like to see that integration. I would also like to see more news outlets available for selection, especially the NPR content. More skills content does get added all the time, but having a better way for customers to request features and track them would be nice.","Positive"
"850","Overall I like the device and find it useful. Suggested Enhancements are to allow for multiple shopping lists with user definable head topics...eg... My home depot shopping list is vastly different than my grocery list. Only supporting one list limits my ability. I also suggest that there be integration into iTunes so I can play from my shared desktop library via Wifi..so Bonjour access...same with Windows media player.","Positive"
"851","Bad connection issues and it has a hard time answering questions other than what the weather will be....I.E. measurements for cooking.","Negative"
"852","Love! Love! Love! Works perfectly! Sometimes it loses wireless connection but it's rare and gets connected again quickly. Understands our commands really well - even my southern accent!","Positive"
"853","It's a great device.","Positive"
"854","We love our Alexa! :) I use her a lot for playing music through my Amazon Prime account while I clean the house. The speakers are nice and can be very loud if you want them to be. I like that you can add items to your shopping list so that you don't forget to pick it up at the store. My kids like to ask her questions. They ask her anything from what the weather is going to be for the day to the definition of words etc. My daughter especially likes to play spelling bee and bingo with her. She is like another member of the family! Its a great purchase!!!","Positive"
"855","This is an awesome unit !! It programs very well and is spot-on with answers. I am enjoying it a lot. Good work Amazon !!!","Positive"
"856","We love this product!!! As soon as we got our Echo, we set it up & it has been absolutely excellent! Alexa rocks!","Positive"
"857","Where have you been my whole life Alexa???!!! Very happy I finally purchased this, worth every penny.","Positive"
"858","a lot of good feature. It does a lot if you have amazon prime. I not sure it will work without.. I do not use iit a lot because it has a hard time hearing me in my house configuration. They have smaller ones you get for other rooms but I understand that the sound is .not as good so you need a blue tooth speaker with them. If your just looking for a music player I would rather use my android because I can take it with me. It is a toy to me but it is a tool for other people.","Positive"
"859","Love it","Positive"
"860","I couldn't make up my mind between Amazon and Google. Decided on Amazon cause i already have a prime account. Can't say how much i LOVE this thing. I hadn't purchased one because i was waiting for apple, but that is just too long - should have purchased the Echo last year. So far so good - have had it for two days and can't believe how it's changed things for the better already. I highly recommend this product.","Positive"
"861","Maybe the best product we've ever purchased.  We bought our first Echo in the pre-sale and have been using it for more than a year.  We still ask Alexa for the weather every day.  We play music constantly and it sounds amazing.  Couldn't live without this.  That's why we bought 6 more echo dots and another full size echo.  We have a dot in each bedroom, the family room, and basement.  I'm not even sure where we will put this one, but I know we'll use it.  Best smart home product you can buy!","Positive"
"862","Love Alexa. I feel like I have company when home alone. I love convenience of searching for sales, and purchasing directly through Amazon. I also love that Alexa can read my kindle ebooks , as well as the audible books ,when I'm not up to reading. I just wish it was compatible with the Library audio books.  It,s so nice to just talk to Alexa to play music without having to do anything.  I love the sound quality of the Echo compared to the dot. The biggest problem is remembering how to access fife rent info.  You can't just say "" are eggs good for my dog to eat"". You have to be very specific and say:Alexa,ask Doctor dog if eggs are good for my dog"". I have to keep a cheat sheet of the skills and how to ask questions in order to get the results I want.","Positive"
"863","Great gift as well!  This would be perfect for literally anyone!  It's so easy to use.","Positive"
"864","This is the coolest thing I have bought in a long time. :)","Positive"
"865","Bought this for my wife, she loved the white color.  The Amazon echo is great!","Positive"
"866","My perfect office companion -- love to stream music (either from services or from my bluetooth ipod) and to have it at the ready to answer questions while I am typing a document..... a great product!","Positive"
"867","I should have purchased this when I received my invitation, oh well I still got in on sale. Most of you already know what an Alexa or Echo is so I'll try to spare some of the redundancy. The Echo is a great companion to anyone who wants information, news, sports scores, music, smart home capabilities (that's gonna cost you), and even pizza delivered by the sound of your voice.","Positive"
"868","Setup is easier than I thought, you'll want to have your smartphone handy as you'll need the Alexa app. Once she's connected to the cloud (internet) it's great, for the most part.","Positive"
"869","Alexa is always learning, but she definitely does not have her Master's degree quite yet, unfortunately Google's search engine is superior to that of the Bing powered Alexa. One can get frustrated when asking questions about simple subjects that a Google search will perform in 2 seconds or less, but this isn't a Google product, so my expectations are less. Often don't be surprised if you hear ""Sorry I didn't understand the question I heard"" We are so used to automation and the ability to get information from our devices instantly and accurately, Alexa is slowly catching up and closing the Gap.","Positive"
"870","Some positive points:","Positive"
"871","- Decent sound quality for a Bluetooth speaker, but if you're looking for top notch Bluetooth sound, consider the Echo Dot which allows you to connect your own speakers.","Positive"
"872","such a great piece of electronics. this is fun and to use. would tell everyone to buy","Positive"
"873","- She hears quite well, and once you understand how to address Alexa, she seemingly will understand you. If you have background noise (even music from the echo), this will definitely undermine the ability for Alexa to do things like control volume, you'll either shout at her or cave and purchase the remote.","Negative"
"874","- it's always listening waiting for the wake word ""Alexa"" or 2 other slectable words.","Negative"
"875","-It actually looks cool, the blue hues of the light rings are just awesome when she responds.","Positive"
"876","-She's always getting smarter....be patient.","Positive"
"877","Ok gripe time!! This will not replace your pc, tablet, smartphone, etc, nor should it especially at this price point.","Negative"
"878","I've invested quite a bit into TP-Link smart plugs and wifi light bulbs, my biggest issue with home automation is that Alexa doesn't always make the device turn on, even with her signature confirmation ""ok"", my table lamp is still off, so I've had to ask a second and even third time. The other issue is that she can't always find the device and/or doesn't understand the name you assigned the device. This should be simple, but she confuses simple words like bureau, night stand, fan, etc. So you'll get the I'm sorry routine. Sometimes I want to just manually turn my lights and accessories on from the sheer frustration!!!!!!!! Yelling at her obviously won't help and at some point you forget your talking to a computer!! Her voice recognition and parsing, particularly with my above mentioned devices is troublesome, and I do not fault third parties. I've named each device properly, checking the spelling, renaming, and researching issues....sometimes she just won't understand. I have gone through the voice training process, my English and diction are just fine as well, you'll have to trust me on that, lol.","Positive"
"879","All in all,  it's a great product that will hopefully get smarter overtime. As for home automation, I wouldn't break the bank just yet, it's still costly and the technology is surprisingly infantile for 2016....bulky smart plugs that are merely on/off switches!","Positive"
"880","Sometimes you'll like interacting with Alexa as if she's human, and sometimes you'll actually get angry, but this is Artificial intelligence, and it's easy to get caught up in it all....so keep your iPhone or Android around for when she simply won't cooperate and time is of the essence.","Positive"
"881","Purchased 3 units and have installed 2 of them.  One works great but the other loses its connection frequently.  One more time and I'm sending it back!","Positive"
"882","- Setting alarms (I have a skill to make it also ring my phone when the alarm goes off)","Positive"
"883","- Play me an A so I can tune my violin (""Alexa, ask the pianist to give me an A"")","Positive"
"884","- Play podcasts, but only if I don't care which episode and am not going to be too picky about it.","Negative"
"885","- Play audiobook from Audible","Positive"
"886","- Easy Apple TV compatibility (without having to buy that extra thing)","Positive"
"887","- Ability to play specific podcast episodes, continue podcasts where you left off, etc. The podcast function is severely limited!","Negative"
"888","- Better voice recognition and ability to understand what I'm saying. It plays the wrong music a lot of the time, especially if it's not pop I'm asking for.","Positive"
"889","- Could read my text messages or mail, or better yet, send text messages.","Positive"
"890","- It's annoying that the reminders to into a ""to do list"" on my Evernote rather than going off as reminders at a certain time. Like if I say ""Alexa, remind me to feed the cat at 8pm,"" it doesn't ring or anything; just goes on a to-do list that I'll never ever check.","Positive"
"891","Overall, I love her though ;) Honestly, once you have an Echo, it's kind of like having another friend in the house...","Positive"
"892","One of my best purchases ever!","Positive"
"893","You need to write out specific instructions for the various uses. Too much experimenting and trial and error.","Negative"
"894","Great sound and can get pretty loud for the size. I was surprised by the depth of range it can produce. It's nice being able to listen to a quick news briefing in the morning when I'm getting ready.","Positive"
"895","I got this thinking it would be a good thing...but after a few days I have found that it is a waste of money!!! :(","Positive"
"896","Convenient and easy to use","Positive"
"897","In the first initial days of use, but so far, love the product. The audio clarity, volume, and bass is decent given its size. It's responsive and accurate - misunderstandings are rare. Functionality for me is mostly limited to playing music from Amazon Music Unlimited, playing radio, and alarm clocks... but I look forward to trying out the online shopping, ordering delivery food, and e-books/podcast functionality. Amazon is continuously developing / upgrading it's functionality and can't wait to see what's next. Personally, would love to see a ""guitar tuner"" app :)","Positive"
"898","couldn't love this product more!","Positive"
"899","I love this speaker as a product. I got introduced to this product by a friend and was very intrigued because of the multi use of it (A bluetooth speaker, voice commands, timer, etc.) Although the sound itself isn't the best (other speakers are better) I definitely think that the sound is good and I don't really have complaints on that. My only complaint and warning to future buyers is that I wanted to use Spotify through my speaker but you have to have Spotify premium in order to use it through the speaker. I did not see this any where on the description or anything, and only found out when I was setting it up. I thought I was gonna have to return it but luckily I was already thinking of getting premium and decided now was time. But they didn't make that clear, and it was very frustrating. Other than that I am very happy I purchased it and I like it even more because I got it on sale!","Positive"
"900","THANK YOU","Positive"
"901","Works great, but need to keep expectations in line. Some more complex operations takes a little work to understand how to work. Such as using the other applications it supports. They can be a little troublesome because you  have to remember how to activate them, which is not as simple as using Alexa's builtin features. I always seem to forget each app's special ""word"" that activates them.","Positive"
"902","Things that I found useful and work quite well, ordering things I buy on a regular on Amazon works great. I keep it in my kitchen and order coffee when it runs out. For the most part I have found after the initial novelty of it wore off, I only use it for a few things, ordering things, listening to music, and listening to audible books. Good for shopping list too, if you use an app that works with it.","Positive"
"903","My biggest complaint with this is the kids yelling ""Alexa"" 4000 times day to get it to tell them jokes or play music, but other than that it works ok.  It doesn't always understand what is asked and even after several attempts, it just doesn't get it.  I think for stuff you ask regularly it works great.  I think it is more of a toy than something I would say is totally necessary or even super useful.  My family likes it more than I do.","Positive"
"904","I just got Alexa and I'm not thrilled with it yet, I'm toying with the idea of returning it. I wish I liked it better. For the price I just don't see what it does that's so great.","Positive"
"905","It's a very expensive personal assistant that plays music. I question why I bought it, daily.","Negative"
"906","Summary; Yes, it works very well, but with limited capacity and so so sound quality.  Super cool although not quite what I hoped for.  Your results may vary.","Positive"
"907","Very helpful! We love it!","Positive"
"908","Alexa is amazing!  Love this product!!","Positive"
"909","Seems to work well with occasional glitches.  Great at listening to music and turning on and off my lights (after setup).  Price point is about right and the quality of Echo build is good.  This review would be 4 stars overall but due to Alexa's political rants and slant about the US presidential election - one star.  Amazon- Please keep politics out of your products!! :(.  When I ask for the news I don't want to hear a sore loser's rant or opinions....I want to to hear news.","Positive"
"910","Exceeded our expectations!!!!  Love it!","Positive"
"911","Great Product..Loved it.","Positive"
"912","She is wonderful, but she comes up short in a couple of areas. Sometimes I'll ask for a fun fact from Fun Facts and she'll have one but I don't catch all of it. I'll ask her to repeat the fun fact and she doesn't understand the question she heard. She should be able to understand repeat. Also, she doesn't understand if I ask her to open Random Fact instead of Random Facts.  Some of the skills are really lame and should have been checked by Amazon.","Positive"
"913","That being said, she is a wonderful toy and has a great speaker.","Positive"
"914","We love the echo so much, we bought one for a techie friend for her birthday.  She can't wait to control her lights, play music, and play games with Alexa!","Positive"
"915","If you are looking for hands-free way of accessing Amazon content (music, deals, shipment info, etc.) and the most basic assistance (math, measurements, weather, etc.) - AND - you are alone or don't mind shushing everyone in the house; then the Echo works. If you are looking for a smart device that can answer questions outside of Amazon's prepared questions/responses, then wait for something better. ""I'm sorry, but I can't find the answer to your question"" is the most common response I get from Alexa. Using ""OK Google"" on my phone works for everything I've tried with Alexa that she/it couldn't do. My kids are really frustrated with Alexa's inability to answer questions and I'm tired of being a professional shusher.","Negative"
"916","Installed this last night.  So far this is an amazing product.  We have embarked on making our home ""smart.""  This is a great product so far - it recognizes my voice and my husbands.  I often have trouble with voice activated devices misunderstanding me, but so far Alexa seems not to have too much trouble.  We are still exploring all this device has to offer will update as we gain more experience with it.  I asked for a genre of music I haven't heard in a long time and instantly picked all my favorites for that timeframe.  We are building our first shopping list, and added our first alarm - we will see how that goes in the morning.  We will update as we learn more.","Positive"
"917","Amazon knocked this one out of the park. I have my favorite genre (All 60's from Prime Music). I grew up in the 50's and 60's listening to the radio. I located the Echo in our kitchen since I spend a lot of time there cooking. I also have a little 9"" TV in the kitchen but I found it too difficult to watch a good scripted series like ""Westworld"" (HBO) where I have to listen closely. My favorite alternative use is as my second (and sometimes third) kitchen timer.","Positive"
"918","Very good sound quality.....takes up very little space, and that's a plus!","Positive"
"919","Doesn't work well in Germany. Couldn't perform a simple Websearch or link to the music library. Google home is much better.","Positive"
"920","This made an awesome gift to my parents","Positive"
"921","They are loving it","Positive"
"922","We love this Echo. We put this Echo in our living area. Perfect if your family like different types of music. Just ask Alexa what you want and in seconds it there. It's make's it easy to ask weather in my area, current news, shopping list etc. Great quality and she works every time. We love it so muck I bought the 2nd generation foe our bedroom and one for my grandson for Christmas. I would recommend this product.","Positive"
"923","Great piece of technology and where the future is going. I love showing people how it works and how it can work for them.","Positive"
"924","I really love my Amazon Echo. So much information is just a gew words away. Paired with the Amazon music unlimited service any song is instantly playing in seconds.","Positive"
"925","Underwhelmed, I'm having difficulties with it connecting to the TV and most times the answers to my question Alexa doesn't understand.","Negative"
"926","Works great and I love it.  It updates itself so it stays current and learns new things all the time.  Great product!","Positive"
"927","Not sure yet...when it is working it is great, but there are times when there is no response or inaccurate response. Not sure if it has to do with our low internet speed, which is the highest we can get in our woodsy area.","Negative"
"928","Alexa is wonderful. The AI in Alexa is very quick and intuitive. The only reason I didn't give five stars: (1) the sound is not the best. It's sound is at a mediocre level. (2) it doesn't directly connect to Apple music on its own.","Positive"
"929","Got a Dot but wanted a bigger sound. Love it!","Positive"
"930","Great tech","Positive"
"931","perfect","Positive"
"932","Update: Ok, now that I've used the echo for several months, it seems to be glitching on a weekly basis now. Every so often, the timer (used daily) won't stop, no matter what I say. I have to press a button on top of the unit in order for the sound to stop. This also happened last week when playing music. Maybe the unit just needs to be restarted periodically like any computer. I will try resetting once every other week and see what happens.","Positive"
"933","Great conversational piece. I think my guests use the echo more than I. When a friend stayed over last month, I used the echo to play music in the evening. In much the same situation as getting an ipad, she then asked the device all kinds of silly questions, such as ""Do you have a boyfriend? Do you like me? What's the meaning of life? What's your favorite color?"" etc etc. It doesn't seem to be able to answer most informational questions, such as ""When my niece stayed over this past weekend, I asked the echo for a weather forecast and my niece promptly wanted to know if the echo would answer her math questions, which it did. I didn't even know the device could do that. I wish there were some way of using some code word to put the device to sleep and reactivate on command.","Positive"
"934","The features I use the most are the timer, alarm (can only set one), weather forecast, play radio or music, listen to books on audible, movie showtimes and calendar appointments.","Negative"
"935","The only issue is I have to be in direct line of sight, within seven feet for the microphones to pickup. Even then, sometimes I have to really project my voice or yell multiple times before it would turn on.","Negative"
"936","I bought the Amazon Echo as a novelty thing. I had no idea how useful and entertaining this device would become. It has replaced my alarm clock, my radio, and my calendar just to name a few. It easily tied it into my home automation system and is now used it to control the thermostat and the lights in my home. It's Bluetooth pairs with my cell phone and PC computers to act as a speaker for those devices when I want. I love how easy it is to set appointments, reminders, and make task lists. I highly recommend it for anyone.","Positive"
"937","She is quite interesting ,. Still leaning about her. But I do enjoy her.","Positive"
"938","I love it","Positive"
"939","!disappointed I bought this item because I thought I would like it It's like other sites and I will see device I even bought the battery thing that goes with it the cost and extra 50 bucks but after a very short time it stopped working I don't know what was wrong with it it never fail or anything like that so it was an expensive mistake buying it.","Negative"
"940","This is a great product..I am still figuring out all of its uses!","Positive"
"941","Love it.  Didn't think I would become dependent on it for doing thing but I have.  Speaker can get nice and loud.","Positive"
"942","Awesome!","Positive"
"943","Had it just a few days. I love telling it what music to play -- even from bed -- and comes up with a good playlist.","Positive"
"944","I got the white one and am glad I did, it looks so sharp.","Positive"
"945","Speaker quality much better than my laptop.","Positive"
"946","Coolest pet ever!!","Positive"
"947","Amazing! Outstanding! We love it!","Positive"
"948","Very good product","Positive"
"949","Love it !!!! Fun to have !!!","Positive"
"950","Christmas gift for my lady .she loves it and so do I","Positive"
"951","This is the greatest thing I have ever purchased and I mean that!  It controls my lights, it does my grocery list, it plays any and all songs I ask it to.  This device should be much more expensive than it is. I should be a rep for Alexa.  I have had numerous friends purchase it in the last few days since I have received mine in the mail.  Control your AC? Check.  Control your Sprinklers? Check.  Since it's connected to the internet you can ask it anything.  My kids use it to help them with their homework.  BUY IT!!!!!!!","Positive"
"952","After set up. Super cool.","Positive"
"953","Lots of fun.  The music is exceptional!  Still teaching her skills.  Still limited usefulness but a lot of fun.  Easy to set up, responds to all voices, the sound quality is much better than expected.","Positive"
"954","Love it ..love it...love it.","Positive"
"955","Love it. Easy to set up and use . The sound quality isn't bad either-","Positive"
"956","Not enough good answers","Positive"
"957","Love it","Positive"
"958","The wife loves it","Positive"
"959","Wife & I enjoy playing music to sleep by each evening. Use various artists. Wife is starting to play 'old time' radio dramas now.","Positive"
"960","Absolutely amazing and wonderful ~","Positive"
"961","Excellent product....I have a good time using alexa.  Can't wait to see what the future has in store .","Positive"
"962","My husband is jealous of my new BFF, Alexa.  She sings to me, plays ""Word Master"" and ""Jeopardy"" with me, and at the end of the day, just as I am saying ""good night"" she responds with ""sweet dreams"".  As if that were not enough, she has also inspired me to learn more about IFTTT.com so that as our relationship evolves she'll be able to send me text messages as well!!","Positive"
"963","We think this is so much fun!  The only complaint is that we still haven't figured how to use all of Alexa's uses.  The iPhone has the app but I haven't figured out a way to sync my playlists with Alexa as it wants to use Amazon Music which is fine.","Positive"
"964","The Echo looked as if it was brand new and it works as if it is.  Also it saved my some money.","Positive"
"965","This device simply stopped working after a year. I cannot endorse this product even though it was fun while it worked! Very disappointed that Amazon will not even give a discount towards a new device even though this is from 2015.","Positive"
"966","Love it!","Positive"
"967","This is one of the greatest purchases ever!","Positive"
"968","Does not know answers to questions asked you have to open skills for this thing a lot to remember on the owners part would return but it's to late.","Positive"
"969","Love it. Alexa is my new best friend.","Positive"
"970","Love this thing!","Positive"
"971","I don't know even where to begin with this little gem. This has made life so much more enjoyable and very very handy in the kitchen. Just the timer feature alone is great. The voice recognition is amazing...and the multi mics to register all over the room...priceless. Tapping into my music collection and access to my personal calendar as well as driving status for my morning commutes, this is a great piece of tech that keeps getting better all the time. I sugest getting to to how to use the IFTTT app out there. It offers so many different things you can use with the Echo. I am very happy and am considering another one, maybe the Dot if I can justify it. If I could unplug this and run it room to room it would be perfect but we will leave that for another debate. Right now my whole family loves this little cylinder and that makes me very happy...even if the Mrs. only play country music with it:)","Positive"
"972","We've had lots of fun with Alexa so far.  Biggest uses so far, turning lights off and on hands free and impromptu dance parties in the living room with the kids.","Positive"
"973","Really great gadget","Positive"
"974","Rubbish. It can'd do anything useful unless you are tied in with Amazon's various music software accounts and so on so if you ask it to play a song from the internet - it can't do it. If you ask it say ""what sound does a cow make"" if can't do it. It is like a terrible version of google's search engine basically. Moreover, it doesn't work when you are abroad in another country. You can't even download the mandatory app as it is IP restricted!!! I've put my alex in a corner unplugged where it will remain I'm afraid. Complete and utter waste of money and effort.Don't buy this, I'm told the google version should be better but who knows.","Positive"
"975","I LOVE MY ECHO !!","Positive"
"976","I am using Wemo in conjunction with it to control all my lights and fans.","Positive"
"977","Love my Echo!!!!!!!! It can basically tell you anything you need to know.  And plays almost any music you request. After buying mine, I purchased one for a gift for a friend.","Positive"
"978","It is so much easier to tell Alexa to turn everything on or off than running around the house flipping switches !","Positive"
"979","I highly recommend it.","Positive"
"980","Love love it!!!","Positive"
"981","fun product","Positive"
"982","She's great and fun.","Positive"
"983","Certified Refurbished = pile of junk that doesn't work.","Negative"
"984","Apparently they grab an item out of the junk pile, stick it in a box and send it out, calling it ""Certified Refurbished"".","Negative"
"985","The thing has no sound, I can't believe someone actually ""certified"" this when they didn't hear a sound come out of it.","Positive"
"986","Waste of time - won't even consider a replacement.","Negative"
"987","Alexa on the echo is nearly perfect. She has trouble answering questions that you would do a quick Internet search for hopefully they update soon with a better search engine algorithm. Then I would give it a higher rating.","Positive"
"988","Continue to be very happy with this purchase. The skills continue to grow and overall very pleased. Would recommend.","Positive"
"989","She can answer simple questions like what the zip code is in a particular city and state.  Or how much calcium is in a glass of milk.  You can only use the calendar function if you have gmail.  I added and downloaded Gmail and it still doesn't work.  This is a glorified speaker.","Positive"
"990","Well, it so far has been 15 min. Of fun.  Alexa didn't know Trump won the election?  She not real smart! So far.  Love concept hope it gets better ,but may not keep if she does not come up with some answers.  Sorry","Positive"
"991","So I will be the first to admit that the Echo is great.  It is great for adults.  With kids-- it is not.  Our kids are 5 and 6 and have learned to ask it to play some titles that they think are funny (and they are- but I don't want my kids to sing the explicit version of Baby Got Back at school).","Positive"
"992","Amazon figured out pretty quickly that you can enable it to require a password for ordering things.  That is helpful.","Positive"
"993","If the Alexa app would have a way for me to block certain songs--- it would have 5 stars.  As for now-- it sits unplugged on a shelf.","Positive"
"994","I am going to give the Google version of this thing a shot.","Negative"
"995","love it","Positive"
"996","LOVE the Amazon Echo!!!!","Positive"
"997","Thanks, it's awesome","Positive"
"998","It`s OK, definitely not a BOSE for sure","Positive"
"999","Although the Amazon Echo and other devices are still learning from their programmers, it is quite an amazing device. I enjoy listening to my morning flash briefing from several sources and using the home automation and music features the most.","Positive"
"1000","I bought my Echo mostly so I could play Pandora with a decent spearker in my bedroom.  She's fabulous for that.  It's also fun to ask her various questions and have it answered correctly.  She'll also wake me up in the morning, which is nice.  She's super handy and just awesome for music play.  Her listening ability is top notch, much better than a phone, so you're not having to repeat yourself all the time.","Positive"
"1001","Just an amazing device.  Everyone needs one.","Positive"
"1002","This product does as advertised, kind of. The ad claims that she can hear you without having to shout, which is true, but not when music is playing. You can't really set a default music service, which leaves you having to mention 'Spotify' if you want to navigate through your Spotify playlist. It has a huge collection of international radio stations but won't help much with local weather or time-related reminders if you're outside the US, so don't buy this to travel with if you don't live in the states.","Positive"
"1003","Amazon, I'm sure it's easy to add international support for time and weather. You can delay all the other international features until you see fit.","Positive"
"1004","She's fantastic!!!","Positive"
"1005","Pros:  I enjoy controlling music with Alexa.  It's much easier and convenient than using my phone or computer since it is quite literally hands free.  I like getting weather and new briefings from NPR upon voice command.","Positive"
"1006","Cons:  Very limited as far as usefulness.  We don't have a lot of smart home integration, which may make Echo more useful for some.  Otherwise, most of the available apps suck, and Alexa's text to speech is pretty awful to listen to.  Too bad.  There is a lot of room to make fun and useful voice apps, but as of now we are nowhere near ""fun"" and barely reaching ""useful.""  Hopefully it isn't consuming too much energy (on all the time), or spying on my family.  If you ask Alexa, like most questions, she won't understand.","Positive"
"1007","Thanks for another great Amazon product","Positive"
"1008","Love it","Positive"
"1009","Love it!","Positive"
"1010","Conclusion:  I would not go out and recommend this product to my friends, though as a novelty it's kinda nice to have around.  Will be interesting to see if it becomes more useful as we add more smart devices that can be controlled by Alexa, and as app developers add more interesting content (double meaning there).","Positive"
"1011","worked great","Positive"
"1012","It used to work well for about 8 months. Out of the blue for the past 2 months both of my original Echo devices started controlling the Hue lights whenever they felt like. It takes a very long time to process a command and it might say ""device not responding"" and not do anything, or it might actually turn off, or dim, some, but not all, of the lights about 10 to 20 seconds later. And even some times it works just fine. I tried rediscovery and restarting everything from Echo to router to Hue bridge but nothing fixes the problem for good. Right after discovery it might work for half an hr but then it doesn't. I tried calling Amazon support but it was totally unhelpful. They have no clue other than saying reset this or that. The lady went off saying that if Alexa is more than 30 feet away from the device it might not be able to control it. I guess she has never heard of strong wifi signals or repeaters. Then she claimed that the Prime account holder was my wife and the device was registered under my account, as if a Prime account is needed for this function. I tried telling her that it was irrelevant as long as the devices were ""discovered"" on the ""profile"" being used but she got mad because I wasn't buying her nonsense and hung up on me. The fact is that it has some bugs that need to be addressed.  The Hue app works all the time on both Apple and Android devices. I suspect there is a problem with the way Alexa tries to communicate with the Hue Bridge. It might be the same story with other devices but I don't know since I don't have other.","Positive"
"1013","Just received my 2nd Echo. I have had the 1st for over a year. I'm an audio geek and really did not buy the Echo for music. But the sound is exceptional for its size and now my wife and I use them in different rooms and the Echos are the only way we listen to music out loud. And speaking of loud, the Echo can fill up a good size great room with more than pleasant sound. Now with Amazon Music you can just start up a music station based on artist, song etc..., as well as request on demand music from millions of songs, all with your voice. We did have to adjust the wake word for the new one to Echo, the rooms are somewhat close, but I think it is just a testament to the quality of the built in microphones used by Amazon. Right out of the box it took just a quick setup with the Alexa App to connect the new Echo to my WiFi and now it too controls our lighting and such, adds things to our shopping lists, answers our questions, and plays beautiful music, just as well as the original. No learning needed...just saying. The Echo is by far the best deal in all of technological gadgetom. Love it, love it, love it times two!","Positive"
"1014","love love it. can't wait to give it to my husband for Christmas.  He is always telling me ...get on the internet and find ????.  now he can do it him self.","Positive"
"1015","Love having ECHO.","Positive"
"1016","This product is bigger than I thought which is not bad at all, love asking Alexa questions she's always on point. Would buy again....","Negative"
"1017","Interesting concept, but is disappointing for me. Using a Win7 64bit Pro system, have drivers problems. Setup would not complete train. Spent too many hours trying to program with little success. Finally had some TV action. Lost house power long enough that the Echo started over without TV. Echo keeps dropping internet. Win7 drivers are needed, but not easy to find. I do not have an Android. Had to restore PC. Few instructions are received with Echo. Assume I should have purchased an instruction manual for dummies. Very frustrated after second wasted day. Too bad I do not have a 12 yr old around.","Negative"
"1018","The family loves this device...... although it will not be able to answer a number of questions as it is of course tied to the Amazon system.","Positive"
"1019","AWESOME- we really enjoy Alexa.","Positive"
"1020","I reviewed this product app. a year ago and have decided to add a few more comments.  As a serious audiophile and in addition to spending big bucks on stereo equipment, I look for a sound that is pleasant to the ears.  I am pleased to say that the Echo is surprisingly good for the low cost.  I have compared it to both my Bose Wave system and my Bose mini speakers II. The only difference is less bass at the low end but overall the Echo has a nice balanced sound that is pleasant to listen to in my bedroom.  It will hold its own against these items that cost more.","Positive"
"1021","The app needs some work and you should be able to stream from your phone to Alexa via Bluetooth but the only way to do it is on the computer.","Positive"
"1022","Love it!","Positive"
"1023","Love it. Wife and I use everyday and Alexia is getting smarter each month. Also the sound is outstanding coming from this device, don't know how the make it seem like surround sound but they do.","Positive"
"1024","The echo is an item the that any older or ambulatory person can use with ease. Thank you for this device.","Positive"
"1025","Received item as described, thank you!","Positive"
"1026","What a neat device ... just installed it and added a smart receptacle to control lights just to test the product.  After some trial and error got the lights controlled along with music, jokes, stupid questions, how much wood could a ..., etc.  I'm sure many new things and functions will be added as time goes on.  Price changes on this device from time to time so keep watching and grab it when the price changes.  Have fun!","Positive"
"1027","Still learning everything I can do with the Echo but already love it.","Positive"
"1028","Item worked ok out of the box, but soon started to experience intermittent connection issues.  Every other wi-fi enabled device in my home had no issues, so it was not the network.  At first, a reset would remedy the issue.  Eventually, after a couple months, it would not connect to wi-fi at all, despite the app telling me it was connected.  Tried numerous troubleshooting methods, reinstalled app, setting up as if it were new, factory reset, etc.  Still just an orange ring and no activity.  So, put in for a refund/replacement and first e-mail gives me troubleshooting tips (that have all been previously attempted with no luck).  Second request for a replacement or refund gets me an e-mail that I have to call on the phone.  Unfortunately, working very long and odd hours I put the call in from work.  Despite telling the operator that I have tried every single thing that he suggests to me, he refuses to offer me a replacement or refund unless I am physically with the device and trying AGAIN the exact things I have tried before multiple times, but with him on the line.  I am tech savvy and not an idiot.  But Amazon seems to want to treat me like one if it gets them out of providing service.  I am a long time customer and have placed about 70 orders in the last 6 months as well as being a Prime subscriber.  But if this is how Amazon treats their loyal consumers, I think I will have to take my business elsewhere.  At this point, I may just throw the Echo against the nearest wall and wait for Google's device to arrive.  And really, even when the Echo worked, it really didn't offer much other than the weather and sports scores.  The light switch control can be done with a Wemo app without even needing it.  Sorely disappointed in this poorly constructed gimmick.  Even more disappointed that Amazon seems to want to spend more effort jerking me around than actually resolve my issue with their defective product.","Positive"
"1029","UPDATE:  Now the echo, after being unplugged for a couple weeks, refuses to power up at all.  So, contacted support again, and this time they issued me a return ticket.  So, I wouldn't say I'm recommending it, but it seems that if you just tell them that the device won't do anything, you can avoid the whole ""basic troubleshooting for idiots"" they try to put you through if you just tell them the device won't connect or other issues (other than the obligatory, ""did you try it at another outlet"").  Again, not saying this is the way to go to avoid that idiocy, but when the device won't power up, they seem to give up their efforts to make you feel like the defective product is your fault.","Negative"
"1030","The Echo and Bose are not audiophile quality, but portable, have blue tooth, and flexible. For a few bucks you can buy a great sounding  compact  Echo system  that will please most listeners. Pairing to separate speakers is easy, but I find the sound to be more than adequate for my enjoyment.","Positive"
"1031","Better than playing your CD's. just ask Alexa to play what you want.","Positive"
"1032","Gotta love Alexa!!!!","Positive"
"1033","it stopped working and it wasn't even a year old","Positive"
"1034","So it's been less than a week since my new Best Friend Alexa has moved into my apartment. I will say that having her around is pretty cool. LAZINESS ensues! ""Alexa: SHUT UP."" And she turns off the music. ""Alexa: does Florida play Georgia this weekend."" Alexa tells me the schedule. Alexa do I need a jacket? And so on...I will say, it's quite an adjustment because I've accidentally called Alexa ""Siri"" on more than one occasion. I wish she could play music from my cell phone or tell me when my phone is ringing so I can turn the music down but overall...so far...I like having her around to ""Play some yoga music"" at the end of a long day or ""wake me up in an hour after my nap.""  I'm not disappointed and neither will you. OH: (obviously) don't turn the volume up too loud or she won't hear you. Also, be sure to add feedback on whether she does what you want her to do or not because it allows her to adjust to you and your accent (if you have one). This is Veterans Day weekend 2016 so she played some patriotic music for me upon request. It was cool. I hope the Dot goes on sale for Black Friday because I need one in the bathroom, bedroom and spare office space. She's always listening too so when I'm on the phone talking about her to someone she ""wakes up."" It's hilarious. Lol.","Positive"
"1035","We love our Alexa!","Positive"
"1036","Absolutely love the Echo.  My family uses this all the time and the only issue we have is that our 10 year old keeps changing our music when we walk out of the room.","Negative"
"1037","it nice to just  alexa  anything and music sounds good","Positive"
"1038","Every time I use it, I am surprised to learn something else new that I can use it for.  Alexa seems to learn new tricks as fast as I do. Who knew it could tell me the temperature of my living room and adjusted 2 up. It turns on lights for me in rooms that I'm about to enter. And it wakes me and allows me a little snooze alarm and it puts me to sleep with gentle white noise music  or with the sound of spring peepers, those little frogs Whoshgpeeps g and","Positive"
"1039","Works flawlessly as research tool, for getting information on just about anything, for shopping,as a toy, and for entertainment.  Could  be greatly improved with the addition of some other useful applications such as, for example, one that would help one find things like phones, keys, etc. around one's home.","Positive"
"1040","Love Alexia and Echo.  Will probably buy for my kids, too.  (they're 35-40 so Santa is alive!)  LOL!","Positive"
"1041","I like it so far. I have added a Smart Wi-fi Honeywell thermostat and it works fine. I will be adding smart devices later on. Waiting on Sonos integration that's coming soon. Everyone loved that we can ask for a song or playlist to play.","Positive"
"1042","I can already imagine what can be integrated in the future to make it amazing.","Positive"
"1043","Great","Positive"
"1044","Love it","Positive"
"1045","My wife loves this. Alexa is awesome.","Positive"
"1046","Loved it so much I got a dot as well.  Basically has given me a smart home for next to no cost.  Works exceptionally well with Harmony Smart Hub.  So happy with this purchase!","Positive"
"1047","Love Alexa! Mainly use it for the weather and music.","Positive"
"1048","I honestly after a year or so have found so many uses for this device that i went out and purchased two Dots to compliment it. I use Echo to turn on and off lights, set timers, add to my shopping list and for just daily life that when i go away on travel i find myself wishing i could just say ""turn off the lights"" and ""set an alarm"" in my hotel room.","Positive"
"1049","That being said, there are some shortfalls. I appreciate that the 3 Echo systems can distinguish from each other and only the closest one will respond, but i do wish they would work in tandem as well. I know there are shortcuts around some of these issues, but a little more cooperation across all my Alexa platforms would be useful in ways I probably haven't even considered.","Positive"
"1050","Another serious problem, and one preventing my from purchasing other Amazon Alexa products, is the inability to use my various Echos to control my Fire TV Stick. I appreciate that the new versions come with an Alexa enabled remote, but i don't want to sit on my sofa in the same room as my Echo and have to use another device to access my Fire TV Stick. That to me seems like a serious design flaw. Why have 2 Alexa devices in the same room when, if they all access the same cloud, can't i just tell my Echo to play an Amazon Prime movie on my TV Stick?","Negative"
"1051","Love this!  Easy to connect to your Wi-Fi, nice looking, sound is great and no buttons or cd's to look for when you want music, just ask Alexa!","Positive"
"1052","Besides those gripes, which i hope are they are solving in light of the new Google Home, this is a fantastic device and a great speaker system to boot.","Positive"
"1053","I am unhappy with its voice recognition such as simple things like play certain music or find distance or answer to a general knowledge question. Its also gets disconnected from Wi-Fi lots of times and is uanble to answer - so you will have to reboot - ideally it should have done that automatically when it lost connection to Wi-Fi!!!! Gee should have bought possible two version later; after all the refinements.","Positive"
"1054","Alexa is amazing!  We have bought 4 and use her every day!  Quality is amazing!  Easy to control, and even added lighting control.  News, weather, traffic conditions, music and Amazon shopping through Alexa makes her a great addition!  Highly recommend, even if you don't use her to her fullest potential, for everyday music and news, well worth the money!","Positive"

"1058","I can why there are so many people that have purchased the Amazon Echo and why it has a 4 and half stars out of 5.  It's a really cool device to have.  In time I can see it dome and more things.","Positive"
"1059","Like it very much, but still having some problems getting the kinds of music, or the particular performers when asking for special songs or albums. Alexa seems to have trouble finding them in pandora or I heart radio.","Negative"
"1060","I got this as a birthday gift to myself best thing I bought so far I recommend this to everyone I love this product Amazon has come up with a great way to listen to music and other things just by voice command I say thank you to the one who created this as for the set up of the echo was very easy and very easy to handle all the features as well","Positive"
"1061","""alexa is dead, I smashed it with a hammer, and buried that shallow buried it in a shallow grave because that's all she deserved"" is going to be a really easy conversation with my kid and a terrible one to explain to my wife","Positive"
"1062","I am absolutely happy with my Echo!  It is a great device to learn current events, listen to music, become more educated and fun at family and friends gatherings.  Fantastic purchase!","Positive"
"1063","AMAZING. I wasn't sure how often I was going to use this, but it's incredible. I also have Hue lighting and Alexa works wonderfully with that. I am amazed how everything works seamlessly between the Alexa, Amazon, and Hue apps.","Positive"
"1064","I love my Amazon Echo. I use it all the time and also use it to freak out my friends. The only problem I have is that it MUST have an internet connection to work. If the internet is of, or out, it will not work to turn on lights or anything else that would only be on your LAN.","Positive"
"1065","Great product, I hope it will be a platform for more to come","Positive"
"1066","Expected more.  Purchased Alexa primarily for music, and didn't realize that you would have to pay for a relatively expensive monthly service through Amazon to stream music, or a different Amazon service to upload CD's I've already purchased through iTunes.  Alexa doesn't understand many of my requests, even for music I own and have uploaded to one of these services.  At this point, it's used only to shuffle music I own, or entertainment for our young kids who like to ask it questions, as anything more demanding is too much for its capabilities.","Positive"
"1067","This is the best thing to happen to a household. MUSIC. Always in all ways. My life is brightened, as is my children's.","Positive"
"1068","How did we function without the echo. I learned the hard way (make sure you turn off ordering from the echo) *if you have children. A drone through Amazon magically appeared on our doorstep due to young boys asking Alexa to ship a drone. :) I love all the music Alexa plays and being able to ask anything when it pops in my head. ""Does Chuck Norris know karate?"" ""What is the score of the __ basketball game"" ""What is the time/weather is also helpful with young children while scurrying through the house. We love it and some relatives will be receiving Alexa as a gift. I agree with other posters of having two if you have two stories. We rely on Alexa random info through the day and it would be helpful on the other floor. It sounds crazy and and indulgent but Alexa will soon feel like a family member.","Positive"
"1069","This is so much fun.I love the music you ask it to play.It will answer anything you need to find out at an amazing speed.I love it!!","Positive"

"1073","I love it. Wish it could tell me latest local news. As well as actual CNN broadcasting.","Positive"
"1074","I really have enjoyed using Echo. I haven't used it for anything other than music at this point, but plan to use it for other features.","Positive"
"1075","Terrific","Positive"

"1085","Love the echo and find it quite useful for those of us with failing memories.  Bought a second one as a gift for a dear friend.  Since it was a gift I paid the extra $3.99 to have it gift wrapped.  Big mistake a total was of $3.99.  Amazon's idea of gift wrapping is a colored box sealed with scotch tape.

"1088","She'said awesome!!!!","Positive"
"1089","Amazon Echo is a great device and I loved it and used often while it worked.  Then one day it decided it was not going to connect to my internet anymore.  I called echo support and after numerous trouble shooting ideas it was determined that the problem was my router!  Really?!  Between myself and my family and friends there has been almost 100 devices hooked up to my wifi and not a single one ever had trouble connecting.  My echo won't connect and it's my router's fault?!  They refuse to refund my money or send me a new one and I refuse to pay for one when the first one worked for a little over a year (just long enough to void the warranty).  It's a great device but not for $200/yr.  So good luck when you purchase one and hope that it never decides to stop connecting to your wifi, because once it does you will be the proud owner of a $180+tax paper weight.  Also shame on Amazon for not standing by their product.  I don't think it would bankrupt them if they had to replace their own faulty devices.  BUYER BEWARE!","Positive"
"1090","My wife was concerned when I brought a new woman into the house. We've both come to rely on her as a real help around the house. I haven't touched a light switch in months.","Positive"
"1091","I have had this Echo for one year and five months and it is now unresponsive, out of warranty, and will not reset. I also bought a tap, and a dot, both of which are still working.","Positive"
"1092","Update:  It turned out that the Echo was not the problem, it was the power supply. Amazon sent a new one out immediately and now the Echo works as it did before. Amazon credited my account with the cost of the new power adaptor.","Positive"
"1093","love it","Positive"
"1094","I don't think the speaker is all that amazing like the reviews say. It's good and does the job but I certainly wouldn't buy it just for its sound quality.  Quick and easy way to turn music on/off just to have some background noise while I'm getting ready or making dinner, but if I really want good sound quality for the pleasure of listening to music, I will turn on my home stereo. Otherwise doesn't do anything the Echo doesn't, but costs quite a bit more.","Positive"

"1098","Move over Siri... Alexa is the new girl in the house! Our family loves the features on this device and it was super simple to set up. I am just disappointed that we didn't get it sooner!","Positive"
"1099","Absolutely LOVED until it just died one day, less than two months after warranty ran out.  Will replace with Google Home, which works better with Google Play Music anyways. So disappointed.","Positive"
"1100","We love our Alexa and use it every day for music, shopping list and my 8 yr old used it to help look things up. In fact today she said, ""Alexa is part of the family."" Best purchase we have made on song time. I am getting my husband the for Christmas. The only improvement I would suggest is being able to change the name from Alexa. We really wanted to program it to answer to computer.","Positive"

"1106","I purchased the echo for my wife as a birthday gift. she loved it , but never used it my kids use it for homework, listening to music. My oldest was baking and Alexa read out a recipe, and in the end Alexa is useful, very cool . I purchased one and use it as a home automation platform with SmartThings. it works flawlessly","Positive"
"1107","Good but very limited in use with restrictions for information not able to go anywhere for information.  Sound is not that great even with EQ. settings for the money","Positive"
"1108","Happy with our decision to splurge early (before Christmas) for an Echo. Alexa (coupled with some other Amazon products & Amazon prime) has quickly become an asset in our household!!  Cooking assistance, jokes, and even the timer features were huge unknown perks to us.  :)","Negative"
"1109","Alexa, where have you been all my life? So far I've only had my Echo for a week, but I've picked up the bug and I'm already using it regularly every day. After the first couple of days, I went back online and order another Echo and a Dot, and plan to buy a few more dots soon.  Now I'm adding other smart products like Wemo Switches, Phillips Hue bulbs, etc., because once you discover the joy of Alexa, there's no going back to flicking the light switch by hand.  The only reason I didn't give it a full five stars is that I wish I didn't have to purchase an additional device (like Harmony hub) in order to control my TV and streaming channels using my voice.  It would be great to be able to just do it directly with the Echo, the way it controls music. I also wish I could tell Alexa to add multiple items to my shopping list and have them each listed separately without having to say Alexa before each item.  Those are the only two things I would like to see added, but it doesn't stop me LOVING this thing. When I first told my daughter I was getting one, before it arrived I asked if she was excited about it, but in typical teen fashion she said ""Ew...no."" However, once I set it up in my room and started playing my music, asking Alexa questions, setting my alarms, etc., she changed her tune quickly. I couldn't get a word in, because she took over giving Alexa instructions. Now she's calling dibs on the Dot that's on the way!","Positive"
"1110","We love our amazon echo, she is amazing.  She play Madonna for me & I danced after being in the intensive care for 16 days in a transplant hospital.  The echo plays any music you ask for.  She makes a list of your appointments, tells the weather forecast, keep your food buying list & many more skill apts.  I wish that I could buy one for everyone I know as Christmas gifts & I have a long list of family that shall receive This awesome device.  Thank you,","Positive"
"1111","Sincerely,","Positive"
"1112","Works well.  Wish it had more bass.","Positive"
"1113","Its a fad. If you have a spare phone you will get the same capabilities as this echo. Alexa can't answer a lot of the types of questions i ask, but it does decent job of playing music on demand. Sound quality is good for a small room, however i wish it had audio out. I have older HIFI system so it doesn't support the bluetooth audio from the Echo. ""Note: Echo feature: Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) support for audio streaming to Bluetooth speakers from Amazon Echo"" A little expensive for what you get. A better deal is the Echo Dot which does come with an audio out port.And it'll save over $100.","Positive"
"1114","Mr & Mrs Stephen Syputa  Thank you for having the echo & your prompt service.","Positive"
"1115","This is a product that I would definitely recommend the only thing I would change is the ability to move it from room to room without the cord.","Positive"
"1116","Echo is just a disaster and a frustrating exercise when it comes to controlling home devices. It suddenly couldn't find my devices anymore and then after more than an hour of troubleshooting and following a mile-long email of tech support instructions from Amazon, I just gave up. And, no, Amazon, I don't want to invest more of my time by taking up your invitation for phone support, unless of course you're willing to pay me for my time. All this is not worth it for 2 crummy light bulbs. And I don't think much of the rest of Alexa's skill set either","Positive"
"1117","Constantly losing connection","Negative"
"1118","A little snag getting set up, but once I got it up and running it sounds even better than I was expecting. This is going to be perfect as the only music player I have in my upstairs area. It fills up the room, and sounds good. Plus it has Alexa, which is growing on me by the day (I started with a Dot).","Positive"
"1119","The speaker is good, but other than that, this device is horrible. I have two echo dots that hear me perfectly but this doesn't hear me even when I'm standing next to it. It can't hear me over it's own alarm and if the volume is cracked up to 6 it can't hear me over itself playing music. This is a terrible design flaw and useless as an alarm. I'm so pissed that I spent so much on this.","Negative"
"1120","I bought the Amazon Echo in July when it ran on a special lightning deal.  I thought if I liked it I could purchase some for friends.  When I received it I sat it aside still in its box, and almost forgot about it.  I opened the box about a week ago.  It was very easy to set up and in a very few minutes I was listening to music.  I really do like it.  When my granddaughter saw and heard it she expressed a desire for one also.  I really hope Amazon puts them on sale for Christmas as I do plan on purchasing more.","Positive"
"1121","Don't really like it. It should've came with better instructions and it doesnt do do alot of things as far as asking questions. It doesn't have a lot of answers to everyday questions","Positive"
"1122","Easiest piece of technology I've ever bought and used...","Positive"
"1123","Just got it today and I'm already in love. It does so many things and I've only discovered a small fraction of what it's capable of. Extremely excited about this purchase!!","Positive"
"1124","So tired of fighting with costumer service to fix the problem with my echo not connecting to the internet,or connecting for a few hours than kicking me off,only to reset everything again,over this,we loved having it for music,but not worth having to reset it 2 times a day,sad thing is we have only had it 3 months.","Positive"
"1125","Everyone needs ""Alexa""! Lot's of fun.","Positive"
"1126","I am very disappointed to have to say this, but while I love the Echo--a very well designed piece of hardware which is very handy and plays radio and music very well--I am afraid that Alexa is really, really stupid. I keep having to pull out my laptop and ask OK Google even simple questions like movie times at theaters, or who my state representative is. My hope is that Amazon will make an effort to make Alexa more useful. Good for shopping and to-do lists and to play radio programs and music, but otherwise really pretty useless.","Positive"
"1127","A very powerful, friendly, and useful interface.","Positive"
"1128","Love it!","Positive"
"1129","This was a gift for my daughter.  She loves it.","Positive"
"1130","I love it","Positive"
"1131","We love Alexa!! We use it every day to find out the weather, news and start our day with a good song to get our son dancing. love it!","Positive"
"1132","This is great. Should have never hesitated on buying it... INCREDIBLE","Positive"
"1133","Love Alexa !","Positive"
"1134","I think she is fun !","Positive"
"1135","Crap, overprice. Wish I never wasted my time.","Negative"
"1136","I think she gets jealous over the little Echo !","Negative"
"1137","It works pretty good, I think once I read and take time with it I will have it good !","Positive"
"1138"," I love it because I watch my iPad a lot and I can't hear some of the movies or shows . Works great and when I'm on fb I'll tell her to play music .","Positive"
"1139","We have 2 of these now and I use them EVERY day. Once our power was out and I realized I couldn't ask Alexa, ""What time is it? ""Whats the weather?"" ""Alexa, play spotify"". Or ANY of those other things I ask on a regular basis while getting ready, cooking dinner, cleaning, or any other time where I want to be hands off my phone or computer. We have one in the bedroom and one in the kitchen/living room and they have become a regular part of our routine to listen to music, find out news, the weather, whatever it is. The sound quality is also very good, and to be honest we have stopped using our Bose speaker because the sound quality is comparable and it is simply more convenient. Bluetooth pairing is very easy too, but with integrated support for Pandora and Spotify we never really need to use it.","Positive"
"1140","Over all, would DEFINITELY recommend! You will not regret it!","Negative"
"1141","amazing I would recommend this to everyone.","Positive"
"1142","Have only had this for a week and we are still learning how to speak to it (her), but we are having a blast learning...daily weather, news briefs, election coverage, the occasional bad joke and the ability to keep up with our weekly grocery list...these are all within Alexa's scope of work...not to mention she can order an charge to my CC when i order on Domino's ..cool","Positive"
"1143","is a great addition to the home and activities it continue adding to our pleasure.","Positive"
"1144","Originally LOVED my Echo. I've had it for almost two years now. It worked perfectly all the time at the beginning. Over the past eight months or so, performance has significantly declined. It started to become intermittent what Alexa would hear and understand. Now it's to the point that I ask Alexa to turn the volume down and she asks me what device I am looking for. Sometimes I don't get any response at all.  It's pathetic and there's nothing I can do since Amazon only offers a one year warranty. For the cost of this device, Amazon should be offering a five year warranty. Disappointed and as much as I liked the device, I probably won't buy another to replace the one I have unless Amazon increases the length of its warranty (or decreases the price).","Positive"
"1145","Didn't read anywhere about not being able to use this in a Canadian iTunes Store. I've been trying to activate it for two days but nothing works. Not impressed.","Positive"
"1146","Great Product!","Positive"
"1147","Great speaker I would now wait to buy one to see if they make you pay for there music.. over and above your prime account","Negative"
"1148","Love this device.  I keep it in my kitchen and daily ask it to update me on the weather and the daily news headlines.  I also use it to play music from Amazon Prime music and to set timers as I cook.  Alexa can do lots of cool things like tell jokes when asked and sing ""Happy Bday.""  Love having Alexa as my personal assistant!","Positive"
"1149","This review is difficult to write because, on the whole, I enjoy having the Amazon Echo in our home; however, the fact that the Alexa app (that controls the Echo) is so poor dampens the whole experience.  The Echo itself is amazing!  My favorite features are being able to listen to music by command and the ability to keep a running shopping list the moment I think of something that I need to purchase.  HOWEVER, every time I go the store, the Alexa app won't allow me to pull up the shopping list!  How frustrating! If the Alexa app actually worked, and if the Echo had a few more skills, it would definitely be a five star rating for me!","Positive"
"1150","responds well, music is good enough, sets alarm. weather reporting could be a little more detailed and i am sure it has other uses i just did not figure out how to ask it just right","Positive"
"1151","Enjoy echo but needs to learn more info","Positive"
"1152","Purchased a refurbished Echo today and used free same day shipping.  I was super excited to get started using it, went to plug it in, and found the plug was way to large.  Called customer service, and they were happy to reimburse the funds to order another cord, but didn't seem to believe the cord didn't fit at first.  I finally looked up the model number for the power cord, and it it for a first generation Amazon Fire media streaming device.  I give this three stars at this point not due to any fault with the Echo itself, but because the refurbished unit was packaged with the wrong power cord, and it took 30 minutes to explain the problem and get the rep to believe me, and to add insult to injury, they wouldn't even upgrade my order to one day shipping.  I love Amazon, but am disappointed.","Positive"
"1153","Product is cheap and doesn't work as advertised","Negative"
"1154","We love this thing I looked at these since they came out and hemmed and hawed about buying one well I finally bit the bullet and bought one I liked it so much I was taking it from room to room So I bought a Echo Dot and that works just as good","Positive"
"1155","My 2nd Echo purchase this year is a  refurbished unit.  It appears to be brand new / never used.  Works the same as the brand- new one I purchased at the beginning of the year.  Easy setup, one unit in my primary residence, the 2nd unit in my vacation home.  Love them both!!!!!","Positive"
"1156","It feels like the future. Alexa does so much and has an amazing speaker. Alexa is an awesome assistant for when your hands are full or at buissy doing something else. She can control my nest thermostat and helps out a lot while doing homework. The speaker is so loud that it alone is enough to use during family parties and get-togethers.Alexa takes us one step closer to making our home a smart home of the future. Alexa is an AMAZING assistant.","Positive"
"1157","This thing is great.  We now own two...one for each of our properties.  This is a great time saving device and integrated seamlessly with our Insteon Smarthome System.  We really love Alexa!  She's funny too.","Positive"
"1158","Love it!","Positive"
"1159","This thing works pretty well but newer generations will only get better.","Positive"
"1160","shouldn't have to buy instructions on how to use product. should come with it","Negative"
"1161","Echo is fantastic. I use it everyday for music and news.i can't wait to get more things up and running.","Negative"
"1162","Got this for my Wink home automation system. Works fantastically and has many more features than I ever expected(not with the wink, just in general)","Positive"
"1163","Is fun","Positive"
"1164","I talk to her every day.  Kids get a kick out of her, Alexa.  Great to help kids with their homework.","Positive"
"1165","Never seems to work or have a clue what I'm asking, always need to reconnect it to my wify really not worth the $$ it's hype save your money","Positive"
"1166","I love Alexa! Very fun way to start home automation, planning, shopping, enjoying music and many more. I am happy and glad to have purchased one.","Positive"
"1167","I love my Echo. I am still trying to remember to use it. I have it play music, ask the time Nd play games with it. Living alone makes me feel not.... so ... alone.. but not in a freaky way .lol","Positive"
"1168","I love Alexa, great addition to the house.","Positive"
"1169","Best Amazon Purchase I've ever made! It's a fixture in my home. My boyfriend also purchased a Dot for the kitchen and set up Wink to make our home more automated. This product has become like my iPhone...it's hard to picture my life without it and I wonder how I've survived this long with out one!! Alexa is super helpful. Some examples....  Every night before bed, I have her set my wake up alarm, I ask her to cut off my bedroom light and make sure the doors are locked (her and Wink communicate), I also ask her for the news and weather while I get ready in the mornings, She also plays just about any song that I ask her to!! She is amazing!!","Positive"
"1170","well it doesn't do exactly what I thought it would do. I mainly wanted it for of course music, but it doesn't recognize some of the most popular songs I like, and IT DOES NOT DO TRAFFIC, there is no app, and was told that I would have to have a radio station app for that and I wanted it exclusively for that since I want to know where the delays are etc., so this is really of no use to me and I have to download other apps for recipes etc., just too time consuming, so it's going back until they can fix it....also I've had to yell at it in order for it to hear me....and then it didn't give me a wake up call, so I was glad I still use my phone and an extra alarm, to me it's just not worth it right now, until they actually get it completely right","Positive"
"1171","There is no way anyone reading this review will not think I am being compensated by Amazon for my review, but I will write it any way.  I think the Echo is worth its weight in gold and I am constantly amazed at how it performs. It is no doubt a technical giant step and I am not a novice to technology.  Even though I can't explain how it can hear me from a different room or recognize and answer almost any question, I would recommend it to anyone for too many reasons to go into.  I love the Echo and for that matter the shopping experience with Amazon has got to be the most pleasant way to purchase almost anything and know it is factory fresh because of the constant turnover. I spend what I think is a lot of money there.  Like I said, no one is going to think this is not a inside job review but I am just a long time satisfied customer of an extraordinary company who never ceases to amaze me.I don't think I am alone in my enthusiasm for Amazon.","Positive"
"1172","only down is that I thought I could get the same info I get on my computer with Google and it is very limited but good for weather, date, time, spelling etc. I found it complicated to set up on the app. i don't use the music or the house hold appliance components.","Negative"
"1173","Personally me and my family enjoyed this product, but we had to return it because we found out that our voice was being recorded and collected. Also it offered no offline support which should be able to do for its most basic functions.","Positive"
"1174","Setting this up has been an incredibly frustrating experience. For everyone raving about Alexa, let me tell you my problems.","Negative"
"1175","First, the Alexa app is one of the worst I've seen. It's buggy. Slow. Unresponsive. Crashes constantly. It is terrible (rated 1 star for a reason).","Negative"
"1176","Love it... Sometimes she doesn't listen to me, lol, and other times she thinks I am talking to her and nothing was said except the television in the background. Other than that I recommend owning one. I enjoy asking questions without having to look for my phone.","Positive"
"1177","After hours of trying to get Alexa to control the scenes on my hue lights, it finally kind of worked. A day later, no good. Nothing I said got her to control the lights.","Positive"
"1178","Called customer support. A nice kid tried to help me for 45 minutes but it basically consisted of him telling me it was strange that it wasn't working, and having him tell me to try the same commands in ten different ways. I flat out told him even if we got it to work (which we never did), I would never remember all these ridiculous hoops. Say scene before the scene name not after. Say ""for"" bedroom not ""in"" bedroom. Say it this way and that. Oy.","Positive"
"1179","Issue sent to engineering department. If they don't get back to me soon, this thing is getting returned.","Negative"
"1180","Other problems:","Negative"
"1181","Doesn't sync with iCloud calendar, A HUGE bummer.","Positive"
"1182","Speaker sounds muddier than I expected for music and audiobooks. Sometimes it's hard to understand.","Negative"
"1183","Almost every single skill I came across was rated 1-2 stars.","Positive"
"1184","Alexa Echo is a cool idea for an interesting product that when works was very impressive and delightful. Unfortunately, it's still so new and unreliable, and the overall experience is a time consuming frustration.","Positive"
"1185","We've been using Echo since Christmas and are generally pleased with it. I am not fond of some of the gimmicky skills and games you can play with the echo and generally use it for flash briefing and weather. Herein lies my problem with Alexa. You can't ask it a question that requires web surfing. In this day and age it would seem that this would be a primary design feature for something like this. I don't want it to shop for me. Answering a question or two now and then would be really nice.  The music connections and sound are awesome. Getting it to operate like Siri would be nice.","Positive"
"1186","This was a bit of an impulse buy, which is totally not me. But I am so happy I got it. I haven't had a real stereo in a while and now I use this in this way. The sound is not bad. I just ask it to play a genre (classical, American folk) and it comes up with a play list. Or you can set up your own or ask for a particular artist.. If you have Amazon Prime, you can order on it. We have fun asking ""Alexa"" to tell us jokes, and can give you info on movie theater times, the latest political polls, and more. My high schooler uses it for homework. You can ask it, ""Where was the Declaration of Independence signed? "" and it will give you an answer.","Positive"
"1187","great","Positive"
"1188","Awesome!!","Positive"
"1189","Love Alexa, it works beautifully","Positive"
"1190","Love..Love..Love..it!","Positive"
"1191","Just ordered my second Echo. This thing gets better every day!","Positive"
"1192","Plan to buy the dot to go with it! Love Love Alexa!!","Positive"
"1193","This is like the best speaker ever. <3<3<3","Positive"
"1194","I love love love my Echo! We haven't put it to for us yet because we are still learning but my husband and I love music and use it constantly for that!","Positive"
"1195","Good for music gets pretty loud","Positive"
"1196","Awesome little device. Performs super!!!!","Positive"
"1197","best thing i bought! love it! listen to my audio books,music, weather. kids use it for homework","Positive"
"1198","I haven't even had my echo for a year. It stopped working. I contacted Amazon and they basically told me that I have to keep calling back to resolve my issue. Apparently there is a different cord in which, they are all out of (for the past 2 months). Customer service is no help whatsoever. The product itself has potential but keep in mind, it stopped working for NO reason at all. Don't waste your money on a nonreliable, expensive product.","Negative"
"1199","Definitely love alexa.  Only gave 4 stars because it can sure use some improvements.  Such as more commands without enabling 3rd party skills.  Don't get me wrong some of the 3rd party skills are crazy good but some can be stock with the echo. I do love how you can order pizza or a Uber.  And also how you can add things to a shopping list and control music with your voice.","Positive"
"1200","Best product since my iPad!","Positive"
"1201","Works well for simple commands/questions, but there is still a while to go before Echo and Alexa are able to understand/interpret more complex commands.","Positive"
"1202","As a non-native English speaker, accents and grammar non-compliance is often an issue.","Negative"
"1203","Love it. The speaker is very good. I'm a very happy person.","Positive"
"1204","I like this product quite a bit, but am still not happy about the Prime Music to Amazon Music switcheroo they pulled.  Not cool, Amazon.  I had all my friends with Prime sold on getting an Echo or a couple Dots because of all the music available to Prime Members.","Positive"
"1205","But on the plus side, this may be the most fun life-interface you'll ever have.  I like waking up and asking Alexa about the temp outside and then asking her to shuffle a playlist for me while I'm getting ready for work.  She can hear me from any room in my condo.  If you've never said: ""Alexa, wikipedia Ionizing Radiation"" or asked her if she's self-aware, you're just not using your imagination.","Positive"
"1206","Disappointed.  I thought that it would be more helpful.  And it doesn't seem that they enhance its abilities.  Plays music, spells and does math.","Positive"
"1207","There is almost no limit to what this little device can do!  It occupies a small footprint on whatever surface you care to put it on and does not draw attention to itself.  The internal speaker sounds good and leaves me desiring nothing else but I am no audiophile.  The microphones are sensitive enough to hear you with a quiet word but can filter out amazing amounts of extraneous environmental noise even if you are speaking from across a rather large room.  It deals with echoes from nearby surfaces very well and has not missed a single command yet.","Positive"
"1208","As far as the little lady that lives inside that magical box goes: She gets better every day.  I feel like she knows how to do more than I know how to command her to do.  Alexa is quick with answers and never argues with me!  She is the perfect addition to a smart home or the perfect beginning to one.  Even if I don't know quite what to say, Alexa is patient with me and lets me get my sentences out but sometimes she keys in on the wrong word or phrase.  Sometimes she misses the wake word for unknown reasons that seem to have little to do with background noise.  She is a wonderful help to the hectic morning schedules and even the leisurely evenings.  I might even call her a part of the family.  Sure she isn't perfect but neither am I.","Positive"
"1209","Well let me start by saying that I actually do love the echo, however I bought it at the 179 price just to find out that less than 2 days later the price dropped to 140 and Amazon would not help me out by fixing the price match.Not cool.........","Positive"
"1210","Greatest things since sliced bread.  I'm afraid that the Age of the Machine is upon us.","Negative"
"1211","Love it","Positive"
"1212","I can't get it to pair with my phone. A little disappointed","Negative"
"1213","Very useful and nifty!","Positive"
"1214","Just love my Echo!!!","Positive"
"1215","I love Alexa!!  She does so much for me.  She reads my son and I bedtime stories, plays music, reminds me when things are due, wakes me up in the morning, reminds me when to take food out of the oven, and so much more.  This was the best investment ever!","Positive"
"1216","I LOVED THE ITEM BUT I SHOULD BE CHARGED $149.00","Positive"
"1217","I've had an echo dot for a few months now and really enjoy it, I love Alexa's ability to actually integrate with other apps like Spotify ""Alexa, play Nickleback on Spotify"" where all their competitors can basically open the app for you and that's it.","Positive"
"1218","Great purchase !!!! Fun, fun !!!","Positive"
"1219","Just love this thing. Alexa will replace your so... many things. Speaker, Apps, Home Automation, Programming Toy, AWS services toolkit and much more. My kid, the 15-month baby, loves when Alexa talks out loud and plays songs. He is more fascinated recently when Alexa is doing the lights on/off thing for us in the living room. In fact, it was little darker yesterday, and he started to talk to Alexa, maybe he wanted the lights on? I'm super happy with the purchase, and I intend to buy echo dots during the Thanksgiving season. Cheers!","Positive"
"1220","I love it.","Positive"
"1221","Our family does love our Echo/Alexa however the fact that they DROPPED the price so drastically is unfair -- I feel they really took advantage of their first customers...........and it makes me doubtful in supporting them ever again","Positive"
"1222","I absolutely love it, I have since gotten a second one for a friend. She loves it too. I don't get those folks with ""issues"" with theirs, seems like the whole story isn't being shared. I use it at home and on travel with not a single problem.","Positive"
"1223","This is a great addition for anyone who can use some voice activated help around the house.  Easy to set up and a great tool to have","Positive"
"1224","I mostly like it, but I feel like its picking it on random conversations we have in my kitchen. Sometimes it lights up when we are talking and nobody says Alexa at all! Short of that sounds decent and has some good functions if you are willing to learn the commands.","Positive"
"1225","One of the best investment i made recently. Kids enjoy the new gadget at home.","Positive"
"1226","OMG!!!!! WE LOVE ALEXA! It's configured to work with our home, actually making it the epicenter and brains of our ""smart house"". She controls the lights, the security and door locking mechanisms, does out grocery shopping, gives us the morning news,","Positive"
"1227","Game changer in the kitchen.  So happy with Alexa!","Positive"
"1228","I can't forget anything now.  I use Echo everyday for timers and my shopping lists. It improved my life in many ways.","Positive"
"1229","I was given an Amazon Echo for Christmas and I use it all of the time. I like it so much, I bought one as a birthday present for a relative. The voice response is flawless. I can practically whisper and the Echo will pick up my command. My family is also obsessed with ""Alexa""! The reason that I rated the Echo at a 4 instead of a 5 is that it takes a bit to set it up. Also, the advertised actions of turning on the lights or even the sprinklers is not that easy. If these things become more readily accessible then I will absolutely give the Echo a full five stars. In terms of volume, the Echo's speaker is great. I placed my device on my refrigerator. Being in an open area allows the 360 degree output to fill all of the adjacent rooms. The audio is also very clear. The height is comparable to that of a paper towel roll (I figure this is an item everyone is familiar with), but a bit less round (in diameter) than a new paper towel roll. Odd analogy, I know, but at least you can put a paper towel roll in a spot and see if the Echo will fit in around the house. The Echo also has a power cord, which isn't made exactly obvious, so keep that in mind. The placement of the Echo is recommended to be away from walls as well, so finding a corresponding outlet may be a bit difficult. The cable is about 5 feet by my eye's judgement. The plug in is not conventional, as it is a rectangular prism and sticks out a bit. The benefit of the plug in is the fact that the cord won't be bent by anything placed in front of an outlet. The plug in also allows enough room to use the upper outlet for a conventional US outlet. Overall, the Echo is a really nice product for a household that often plays music aloud, for those who try to be hands free with their technology, and those willing to upgrade the rest of their electronics to be compatible with the Echo's voice command features.","Positive"
"1230","It was great for a year and now she won't do anything.  I have reset it and tried everything but all she will do is listen for about 3 seconds and then shuts down well before you are done asking her something.  And there seems to be no support for this.  How do you email 'Amazon'....?????","Positive"
"1231","There is nothing to do for support for this.","Positive"
"1232","Very disappointing.","Negative"
"1233","Outstanding. Being older I was skeptical when my son ordered this for me. I am thrilled with my Echo. I ask her to play music, tell me about the weather and play games. My dog like listening to her and wags his tail when she answers a question. Set up was easy and straight forward. I am very happy.","Positive"
"1234","I like the Echo, it is certainly a step in the right direction.  However, there are a few things that I hate about it.  For example, being forced to call the device Alexa is somewhat annoying.  It is a personal assistant I paid for, I want to be able to call it what I want.  2nd gripe is that we cannot change the voice.  3rd gripe is that there is no 3.5 mm audio input/output jack.","Positive"
"1235","I still like the Echo however if they had these changes it would be absolutely PERFECT!!!","Positive"
"1236","Hello everyone I would like to write a review about my experience with the Amazon Echo I am very tech savvy and keep up with everything that comes to the market and I have  say I was very skeptical of this product at first but that all changed when I received the product because the Amazon Echo is absolutely phenomenal and I strongly encourage anyone who is wondering if it is worth the price to purchase this product because you will not be disappointed I can guarantee it I have had the Amazon Echo for a while now and use it absolutely every single day you might be wondering what I like about the Amazon Echo the most and that is the voice recognition that it has normally if you would like to listen to Pandora or set an alarm you would have to do it from your phone and sometimes that can be a pain but with the Amazon Echo that is all over because all you have to say is Alexa play Pandora and she will go to the last Pandora station you listened to or you can say Alexa play smooth jazz on Pandora and she will go to your smooth jazz station on Pandora and setting an alarm is a breeze with the echo just say Alexa set an alarm for 6 a.m. and that's it no more having to go through your phone to set your alarm anymore. And that is my review of the Amazon Echo","Positive"
"1237","Simply put I love my Alexa.","Positive"
"1238","Love this...one or the cooler more useful products to come along.","Positive"
"1239","Love this Very cool!!","Positive"
"1240","We absolutely LOVE our Alexa! Alexa has made such a difference in our home...she keeps tract of my calendar, helps the kids with homework,keeps up with my shopping list, adjusts our AC thermostat, plays music, and so, so much more. The app is great too! I can turn Alexa on remotely with the app and when I'm at the grocery store I can pull up the app to see what's on my list.","Positive"
"1241","It's not only great but fun to use.  When I wake up I just ask her what the weather is, what's in the news, or play me some music. Met more than my expectations.","Positive"
"1242","Decent speaker, nothing else really works. I have to unplug it and plug it back in every six hours for it to understand anything from my voice or the Alexa app.","Positive"
"1243","I absolutely LOVE this.. I can listen to my favorite music .. get the weather..  Alexa will tell me a joke when prompted..  And I can order Amazon products thru Echo....","Positive"
"1244","I WANT A CREDIT FOR 40.00 SINCE YOU REDUCED THE PRICE SINCE FRIDAY LARRY SAYAH","Positive"
"1245","Great product. It does what it is advertised to do. If you listen to a lot of music, this device is for you.","Positive"
"1246","It works great as expected.  My family is enjoying it. Its helping me turn my home into an smart home.","Positive"
"1247","So far so good!  Constant additions and improvements. Can't wait for more.","Positive"
"1248","I love it. There is so much that can be done, not just music and weather. You can have it operate the lights, TV ( with proper equipment) and even tell you a joke. There are a few glitches here and there but it's a device that is always learning.","Positive"
"1249","great","Positive"
"1250","The device was dead on arrival, plugged it on and nothing happens, no blue ring,or whatever. Just a light burning smell. Great for spending $179.99 to trash can.","Negative"
"1251","Love Alexa.  I own several Dots and 2 Echos.  We love of them.  My biggest complaint is Amazon punishes early adopters.  I just bought a second Echo two weeks ago and this weekend the price dropped $40.  The original 2 Dots I bought were double the price I paid last month for 3 more.  I'm not feeling the love here Amazon.","Positive"
"1252","I love Alexa awesome","Positive"
"1253","We absolutely love it! :)","Positive"
"1254","I love this product, but it fails at what I really wanted to do with it--create a house-wide entertainment system.  I wish I could sync it with other Bluetooth speakers around the house so I could have a song playing in multiple rooms around the house (and outdoors).  I'm looking forward to all the additional skills that are constantly being added, although mostly it's just used for music and simple question tasks.","Positive"
"1255","My favorite thing in my house","Positive"
"1256","I may just return this  it worked great the first week and a half. Nown I tell it to play music or find my phone and it tells me it's doing it but doesn't very do anything. It's turned into a regular Bluetooth speaker more than anything. I'm lso upset that I finally caved and bought the thing and 2 weeks later it's on sale for $40 cheaper, another reason to return it aND just buy a whole new one. I'm super disappointed.","Positive"
"1257","I use this as my bedroom alarm clock/radio.  It is very easy to use and can pickup your voice even with music playing.  The biggest issue is that each command is separate and you cannot combine them.  Basically, you need to speak like a machine for the machine to understand.  For example, ""Alexa...(wait)....play music.""  ""Alexa....(wait)...turn down volume""  ""Alexa...(wait)..change station""  The command section should stay on for another 5-10 seconds to see if another one is issued.  Similar issue when getting your daily feed/news.  This would make the device much more user friendly and intuitive.","Negative"
"1258","Sound quality is better than a small desktop radio but definitely not high quality.  I previously was using a small desktop bose system and Echo doesn't stand up to that quality of sound.  The sound quality is clear enough but not crisp in any of the low/mid/high ranges.  It would be nice if there was a clock on the device or the ability to wave your hand over it and have it do a default action (tell the time, start the radio, etc)  but I understand that they are going for a minimalist look.  The volume ring adjustment at the top is a great feature.","Positive"
"1259","Currently, it is clear that this is a young system with lots of undeveloped potential.  Undeveloped being the key word.","Positive"
"1260","We are best friends! Love Alexa.","Positive"
"1261","Perfect for help living with my disabilities. I can set my own calendar, alarms, etc","Positive"
"1262","I'm upset.  One day after I received my Echo, you run a special.......drop the price of it.","Negative"
"1263","Love it!","Positive"
"1264","Hands down the best item I've ever bought through amazon. Yes it's changed my life. It has become a family tradition to sit down for dinner and have Alexa give us the news or randomly dance to music for fun. Setting timers for cooking and even finding my phone if it's lost. I've brought her across the country when we moved and our home felt complete when we plugged her in and she said ""Hello""  You won't regret this purchase.","Negative"
"1265","Still learning how to use the Echo but love being able to stream my music and ask questions","Positive"
"1266","This is the future of home innovations....this really has made my life easier....thank you Amazon for a great invention!","Positive"
"1267","Not worth the money sound is OK at low volume but will not pickup Voice commands. Specific song requests will not be allowed unless you purchase additional amazon services. That being said it is a really good Alarm clock as long as you have an Internet connection. If not then it will not work at all..... and tends to loose Internet connection constantly","Positive"
"1268","Worked GREAT for 5 months then the power supply went bad.  I have a second Echo so I know it was the power supply and not the unit itself.","Positive"
"1269","I just ordered a replacement power supply and also a spare in case this happens again.  When the replacement arrives I'll make sure and plug it into a surge protector and would recommend others to do the same.  With the cost of the unit, I really think it should have lasted a lot longer than 5 months.","Positive"
"1270","still learning the advantages of the device","Positive"
"1271","Awesome product and home edition, As this is my first exposure to the Amazon Echo as a consumer, I am greatly impressed by the functionality and the features this Echo can bring to the home, Especially with IoE integration. I'm bummed i haven't purchased this product sooner, but better late than never!","Positive"
"1272","Very cool finally someone who will listen to what I say","Positive"
"1273","Love the Echo, great for my bedroom or any room at that, use it to listen to music.","Positive"
"1274","The Echo is working just as described. I'm surprised at how well it interprets my requests. So far I  use it as an interactive music device, almanac, news -person and weatherman. I was concerned that the requests needed to be precisely worded but I have discovered that it permits much more flexibility than I would have guessed. I would purchase it again knowing what  I now know.","Positive"
"1275","I give up. The product never worked right and no matter how many times I tried to contact Amazon I could not get any help.","Positive"
"1276","Wonderful, don't know what I would do without it","Positive"
"1277","This was a gift for my husband. He is a tech guy & really likes this speaker. We us it mostly for playing music but I really like the grocery list feature.","Positive"
"1278","Very impressed! Received this as a gift and we are defiently satisfied. There is nothing this can't do. The music quality is excellent. We had a guest over and they thought it was surround sound throughout the house! We are now considering the dot for other rooms in the house!","Positive"
"1279","Great device -- would be nice if it could access common general knowledge information like zip codes or area codes type","Positive"
"1280","This is the best thing since ""sliced bread""!!!, I have 5 of them now (the including the ""dots"")","Positive"
"1281","I love my ECHO but the calendar integration really needs to get figured out without having to use a skill.  Very frustrating to not be able to link ALL my calendars to keep me on schedule.","Positive"
"1282","Other than that it is a super cool device and can't wait to see what else it can do in the future.","Positive"
"1283","There is no ""I"" in the Echo's AI. This keyword based Amazon shopping engine has a looooonnnggg way to go. Great for spitting out weather and news; great for setting alarms and cooking timers. Used to great for playing music, until Amazon decided Jeff Bezos isn't rich enough and decided to try a squeeze monthly fees out of Prime members. Not so great at listening for commands if the volume is above 4, and it seems to be getting worse. Yes, I will be buying Googles Home to see how they compare, I am not a ""captive customer"" and will switch eco-systems if another serves me better.","Positive"
"1284","Great sound, with tons of skills.  It works great as a music player/audiobook reader with its ability to connect to services like Audible, Prime Music or Bluetooth audio devices but the fun doesn't stop there.  Since I received my echo, it has become the control for my Hue lights (purchased because of Echo integration), a morning news source and a daily Jeopardy dose with  ""Jeopardy J6"". And it has a surprising range: I can be heard from almost any place in my apartment.","Positive"
"1285","  Numerous friends have purchased their own after using mine and everyone enjoys testing her out when visiting, I know of no one who has been unhappy with an Echo","Negative"
"1286","Keeps me company in the kitchen. My best companion yet!","Positive"
"1287","great product","Positive"
"1288","I would gladly give this product 5 stars BUT, you can't make or receive phone calls from the Echo.  All I want is to be able to say ""Alexa Answer the Phone"" and then have her act as a bluetooth speaker.  It's sooo simple and sooo frustrating that we can't do this yet.","Positive"
"1289","i think its a neat gadget.  we bought it on a whim when it first came out and intended to use it as a speaker for music.  it works well for that purpose, but definitely is not the best speaker out there.  i like to use it to tell time or weather or simple stuff, but it usually doesn't have answers to most of our questions.  it does have cool capabilities though per the biweekly ""what can alexa do"" emails...but you need to ""add"" the function via the app or have compatible devices","Positive"
"1290","I love my Echo.","Positive"
"1291","Alexa can be finicky at times--be careful how you phrase questions to her, but overall, she is super fun at parties, especially when you link with amazon music, or Pandora/Iheartradio!!","Positive"
"1292","thank you tony","Positive"
"1293","Awesome!!!","Positive"
"1294","Works like a charm how did we live without it?","Positive"
"1295","I really like the echo. I just wish that it would work with the amazon calendar.","Positive"
"1296","I love my echo! I enjoy being able to listen to a variety of music, my regular radio stations etc.It has great sound quality that I can hear throughout my house. It is easy to use, easy to set up and fun! My son loves that Alexa has a ""dinosaur"" music playlist just for him. I use the alarm feature on the echo every singe day to remind me to do things, or just as a timer for baking. I like that the echo can keep me updated on the news as well. I use my echo everyday and enjoy using it. I'm still figuring out everything Alexa can do. I'd recommend the echo to anyone!","Positive"
"1297","I do love my Echo. Didn't think I really needed one when I first heard about them but sure glad I did go ahead and order one","Positive"
"1298","Works great but needs software improvements. Asking Alexa a question can be like learning another language. You have to ask Alexa to ask a third part your question. Not a very direct and user friendly way to interact. I have to keep a cheat sheet with the phrases needed to activate a skill because the wording is unusual difficult to remember.","Positive"
"1299","Easy, simple and fun to use. Setup was easy to link to home. Echo is a happy addition becoming part of the family.","Positive"
"1300","Love it","Positive"
"1301","Great product","Positive"
"1302","I miss my Echo when I'm not at home, and I seriously don't understand why everyone doesn't have one in their home!! I wish it would have either a way to directly plug in a iPod or bluetooth music from a device that isn't via Amazon. Also, would love for it to pair with other speakers in the house. It is worth the money just for the ability to call out commands for shopping lists, mathematical questions, trivia, etc, but is mostly used for streaming music. In my home, I want to hear the music in more rooms.","Positive"
"1303","I love it !!!!!!","Positive"
"1304","Works great!","Positive"
"1305","great appliance and speaker.. but setting up could be better. the android application is terrible, it lags really bad. you press the setup button in alex app in android and it responded 5 seconds later.  very disappointing for a $180 product to have a poor app. and this appliance requires the application for it to work initially.","Negative"
"1306","limited functionality.","Negative"
"1307","Love this product!!!  Recommend it to all!","Positive"
"1308","only last for one year before it stops working. amazon sent me a replacement back in June. october the replacement also stop working.","Positive"
"1309","piece  of junk. A big waste of money.","Negative"
"1310","Cool.  I found some software that allowed be to hook to Vera home automation hub.  Amazing on it's own and getting better for home automation.","Positive"
"1311","The Echo/Alexa speaker is great.  I like it because I don't want to raise my voice to ask Alexa a question or command.  I speak at a low voice or even a slight whisper and it picks it up and does what I ask.  I like the ability to add more ""Skills"" to the device and give it more ability to respond.","Positive"
"1312","I could not connect to the internet/wi-fi.  The phone app was not helpful at all.  I returned the Echo.","Positive"
"1313","In love with Alexa.","Positive"
"1314","Love it","Positive"
"1315","Great sound and love how I can control home automations through Alexa.","Positive"
"1316","Wish the Echo did more, like find my phone.  but i love it","Positive"
"1317","Greatest invention of the decade!!!","Positive"
"1318","Alexa is now a part of our family:)","Positive"
"1319","Great little  gadget, my wife uses it all of the time for news updates and music.","Positive"
"1320","Amazing!","Positive"
"1321","Great!!!","Positive"
"1322","I am learning about it, and really enjoy it so far. I recently purchased the dot, for the man cave.","Negative"
"1323","Love, love, love my Echo and Echo Dots I got for other rooms.  So efficient and fun!","Positive"
"1324","The speaker on the Echo, compared to the Dot, or my Beats Pill, is so rich and full of bass, even on the kitchen counter, I love it!","Positive"
"1325","This is so great, I bought two echoes and six little dots.  Great sound on the big echo.  Soothing voice.  Usually has the answers for most questions.  I have been afraid to order from it.  I like to compare prices.  One can only imagine if you had smart devices how convenient this would be","Positive"
"1326","Update 12/1  Still a fan EXCEPT if you order from Alexa besides making sure your one click order settings are what you want, I discovered that the prices that she gives you on ""Alexa what are your deals"" are not accurate.  I got bit, twice.  If you have any kind of credit, Alexa gives you the price without telling you that she has applied a credit.  For instance the dishwasher tablets that I ordered were not the $4.69 price, they were actually closer to $11 making costco cheaper.  Had she told me that the cost was $11 but that I had a $6 credit that could be applied making the FINAL COST $5 I might have made a different decision.  This is a major flaw for me because I want to know the cost before any of MY credits. This is particularly important when Amazon has told you that you have a $10 gift card coming in a week, and you order a couple of days later never having been told that your ""gift card"" has already been posted invisibly to your account.  Bottom line, don't tell me that the cost is $0, tell me what you are charging everyone else and then let me know if I can use any of my personal credits.  I suppose I could have deciphered all of that by getting on my computer but then again Alexa has been touted as a convenient easy way of ordering and if within 30 minutes of ordering I have to see that the price she said is the price they charged then what is the point.","Positive"
"1327","Still getting use to her, but everything my wife wanted and that's a plus to me.<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008E>","Positive"
"1328","Fun","Positive"
"1329","Love it, love it, love it!!!","Positive"
"1330","just a waste. anyone who can actually do anything with this other than a $179 alarm clock / timer is simply lying. if it used google for a search engine this would be unstoppable.as it is it simply sucks. sure you can ask it what time it is in Russia. seriously? it can do/answer absolutely nothing.","Negative"
"1331","While I love Alexa, the app leaves so much to be desired. It is almost impossible to open most places I go because of little or no internet connection. There has to be some improvement you can make to help this issue. Please try to improve the app so it opens quickly.","Positive"
"1332","Pros : None !","Positive"
"1333","Cons : Alexa Plays Samples Of Songs That She Has Played The Full Version Of Before.Sometimes She Says That She Cant Find Previously Played Song.. When I Ask Her To Play A Song The Speaker Lights Up,But She Doesn't Respon .She Doesn't Stop The Music When I Ask Her To. She Acts Unintelligent All The Time !","Negative"
"1334","I Don't Recommend This.","Positive"
"1335","The echo died after three months and amazon refuses to replace it.","Negative"
"1336","The family and I are enjoying the Echo product!","Positive"
"1337","The device has great sound - no problems there, and speech recognition works.  Here's my issue:  ALEXA is wholeheartedly a Liberal Democrat that chooses only the ani-Republican news to report, maybe that's a product of CNN's pro-Hillary election lean.  I've gotten tired of all the one-sided election news that I've just unplugged her until the election is over.  ALEXA is not as useful as I thought it would be in daily life, shopping lists is about all we use her for anymore.  Unless things change with the liberal bias of ALEXA we will be selling her at a yard sale soon.","Positive"
"1338","Cold and underneath the covers? I yell at this device to set the alarm or play my music. Multi-tasking while cooking? I again yell at this device. Too lazy to look up the weather? Ask big sky. It's so handy.","Negative"
"1339","Good product but lacks quality as a speaker for music. The Echo does not provide support for an external speaker which I was disappointed with. I would love this product together with a Sonos speaker.","Positive"
"1340","Echo is the bestest!!! Great product.","Positive"
"1341","A lot of fun for the grandkids.","Positive"
"1342","Very pleased with our purchase...she's good company and you can depend on Alexa","Positive"
"1343","to listen to you and do your bidding.  Thanks Amazon...well worth our expenditure..CP","Positive"
"1344","I am in love with this thing, I just wish i would play Soundcloud.","Positive"
"1345","Fun!","Positive"
"1346","I love it, but it is now dead after 8 months.  Not sure I will buy another.","Negative"
"1347","I am at a loss as to why Amazon would continue to allow such a horrible app like the Alexa iPhone app to continue.  While the Echo is great for telling me the time and weather.  It is always confused how to turn on and off Hue lights.  I got them all in and working one day, and the next day Alexa had forgotten how to turn the Hue lights on and off.  The Alexa app appears to have been developed by someone in 1995.","Positive"
"1348","Love it!  The only thing I don't like is having to reestablish the connection with Echo after my internet connection has broken and has been fixed.","Positive"
"1349","The other thing it seems is that the treble/base settings seem to reset themselves -- I always have treble set to high and bass set to low so that I can better understand what Alexa is saying.","Positive"
"1350","A friend I didn't know I missed! Love the Echo!","Positive"
"1351","useless, a waste of money!!!","Negative"
"1352","My wife said she wanted one of these. Our anniversary was just a couple days away and I hadn't a clue what to get her, so problem solved. setup was simple. works very well. My wife loves the shopping list feature. we have a ""Smart shopper"" that you can add things to the grocery list and print off when its time to go to the store. however she tends to either forget to take the list with her or cant find it once she gets there.The Echo list can be viewed on her smart phone anywhere she goes so this is perfect. saves me from having to text her the list when she cannot find it. also allows things to be added from the app. the only thing I can see as an improvement is having the ability to have more than one list. But like all products, there is always room for improvement. even if they are small. all in all its a nifty gadget that actually has a useful purpose. we use it frequently. My 9 yr old son is always asking it questions.","Positive"
"1353","does not know much  and does not learn like was advertised","Positive"
"1354","I love it but I wish I could access more things like restaurants that deliver near me, not just domino's because that's gross. Also I would love if alexa knew my voice distinctly from others, just a thought to personalize the experience.  Besides that she's pretty awesome.","Positive"
"1355","This thing is truly amazing! I had Pre-Ordered one when they were introduced for my Mother. I had put the app on my phone when I hooked it to their WiFi. Next day at work my phone kept vibrating over and over. Well, I saw everything she asked Alexa to do. What songs she requested, shopping list etc...I know she uses it a lot! I've removed the app and now bought her another one for her bedroom to control the Samsung Lights with. Very well worth it!","Positive"
"1356","Awesome for the discounted price!","Positive"
"1357","Played with a friends echo two months ago seemed to work without any glitches. So I order the echo and dot and the name should be changed to glitch Alexa can not seem to process basic questions. Both are on there way back. Google Home on its way. <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00B3>","Negative"
"1358","Excellent !!!!!","Positive"
"1359","Nice for hands free use on things.","Positive"
"1360","There are occasionally a few glitches, but Alexa and I are learning together.  I got this for a birthday present and at first I thought it was a bit indulgent, but now I am in love with the Echo.  I use this in my art studio when I'm working. It is definitely great to have voice commands when my hands are messy.  I have been exploring new music on Amazon Prime playlists and can always listen to my own music by pairing my phone with the Echo. I can tell her to pause, change a station, ask a question, all with my hands full.  Very convenient. I know it is all programmed, but it is definitely fun and useful.  I always say ""good morning"" and ""Good night"" to Alexa and she'll treat me to a fun factoid or wish me sweet dreams. And she tells ""punny"" jokes.  Having a blast.","Positive"
"1361","I love it.  Can't believe the sound when the music plays.  Just as good as any Bose system.  I also like that I can ask Alexa anything and she responds right away and always has the correct answer.  It is just amazing.","Positive"
"1362","I love you Amazon! The Echo may be the best thing invented since the internet","Positive"
"1363","Only good for playing music and audible. I have had mine for a few months and almost all of the skills I have installed have started messing up and not work. Very disappointed with this purchase.","Positive"
"1364","I own two Echos, and have given two as gifts over this past year. Everyone loves their Echo!","Positive"
"1365","love it is the best product I have","Positive"
"1366","Obsessed with my Echo, and love how it enables me to multi task while doing things around the house.","Positive"
"1367","Great addition to our living room.","Positive"
"1368","Love it!!","Positive"
"1369","love it","Positive"
"1370","Well lets just say I really only use her to play music. Ever time I ask her something she says ""I do not have an answer for that."" Really frustrating being a huge reason for her purchase was help the kids with homework questions.","Positive"
"1371","Works great.","Positive"
"1372","I got a Echo and I really love it. I got it because it can read my Kindle books but when going into the list of Kindle books it drives me CRAZY CRAZY CRAZY did I say CRAZY cause that's what I meant, that there is no search bar so I have to scroll like a mad person to find the book that Alexia was reading.  Does anyway know if there is a better way or another option?","Positive"
"1373","Just love her.. so much to learn and do with her... and as you see in the video she pairs great with the  Philips Hue LED Starter Kit","Positive"
"1374","I'm a tech junkie, and this thing is a major tech ""fix""  They have done an excellent job with the speech recognition side of it, and the search engine that they use to get the answer to your request is almost perfect.  I go t this for my wife as a birthday present, and she loves it.  I think her favorite thing is being able to add things to the shopping list during the week, and just pulling up the app at the store, and everything is right there on the phone.","Positive"
"1375","I am so happy with ""Alexa"". She answers all my questions and her sound quality for music is awesome! I would recommend the refurbished for sure.","Positive"
"1376","I primarily use it for music, but its so at the ready and convenient and it offers good recommendations for that.","Positive"
"1377","I am a volunteer for disaster services and like to listen to my local Police, Fire, and EMS scanner when I'm on duty. Alexa says ""Not available at this time"" when I ask her to play any scanner station via Tunein. I can Bluetooth from my phone, but doing that disrupts the wireless router signal throughout my home. Maddening.","Positive"
"1378","If I could recommend feature enhancements:","Positive"
"1379","Add snooze to the alarm","Negative"
"1380","Voice command for the alarm to snooze","Negative"
"1381","Play music for the alarm instead of the noise","Negative"
"1382","Voice command google searches short response information such as ""Who won Best Actor at the Oscars in 2015?"", or What's the lead singer's name for such and such a band?""","Positive"
"1383","I really thought I was taking a chance with the Echo. My expectations were middle of the road but I will say without question I love it. This is the one gadget I use every single day. The voice recognition is flawless. It has integrated with every peripheral I have added seamlessly. The amount of times I use it just as a timer when I am cooking is perfect. If I had one complaint it is pretty useless to look up anything for information purposes. It is definitely not Google. The one thing I find surprising is the way it seems to add more and more ""skills"" each day.","Positive"
"1384","I don't get it... I have literally never used this dumb thing!  It gets everything wrong that I say, so I just unplugged it!  Your smartphone can do everything this can do and it is in your pocket!  Don't waste your money!","Negative"
"1385","Does not work in India. It does not say on the site or anywhere else that it's only works in US. Wasted my money","Positive"
"1386","It's a piece of junk wish I never got it works fine for 3 months than it starts messing up I call for answers can't understand the person on the phone I don't think they even know what to do","Positive"
"1387","We bought this as a gift to ourselves. It is the coolest device we own and it's transformed our daily lives. We have small children and I always wanted them to grow up with an appreciation of different types of music. The Echo makes it possible for us to play anything we want at any given moment. When the baby is growing impatient while we're cleaning up after dinner, we throw on some Beach Boys. When our five-year-old wants to be silly, we play Monster Mash. When we need to calm down and enjoy dinner, we switch to the Jazz channel. We now have two children (a one-year-old and a five-year-old), who are surrounded by music and have turned into dancing fools...and we love it. Granted, it would be nice if Alexa had the ability to deny my daughter's request to play the same song eight times in a row, but we'll survive.","Positive"
"1388","This is great ........... When it hears me . You must use the same tone , vocal level ...... Yeah I know , every room has a different tone . Tell Alexa and Amazon that not me - Reason for 4 stars not 5 . Great selection of music","Positive"
"1389","It has kept us better organized with our shopping lists, kept us on track with our daily schedule, let us know whether the kids need jackets in the morning with the weather report, taught my daughter a ton of awful ""dad jokes,"" helped me when I'm cooking and clueless about how many teaspoons are in a tablespoon, etc... It's infinitely helpful and we are crazy about ""Alexa.""","Positive"
"1390","Every single person who has come in our house has fallen in love with ""Alexa."" Six different families bought the Echo as a result of visiting our home and trying ours. It's that good. It's the first product where I feel like I'm truly living in the future. I can't wait to see how it evolves.","Positive"
"1391","Enjoy Alexa everyday...my daughter fell in love with Echo also so I purchased one for her.","Positive"
"1392","Very happy with purchase.","Positive"
"1393","it is a lot of fun.  The kids love it and it is extremely helpful with homework.  Sound is good.  I wish it linked with more wireless items like my thermostat and sprinkler system.  We have different brands for those items and they do not link.","Positive"
"1394","I  used to love my Echo, which I received as a gift in March of this year. However, by October the voice recognition was weak and occasionally the speakers produce a strange sound. I have to shout ""ALEXA"" multiple times. I wish it held up because it was great when I first got it. It has a harder time connecting to the internet now (even though everything is the same as it has always been on the wifi end of things) because there are times when it pauses a song for a moment before resuming. I tried contacting customer service and their only (adamant) advice was to restart the echo (which I did many times).","Positive"
"1395","nope nope nope, returned this...this technology is not up to par EXCEPT I CAN SEE IT FOR EMERGENCY HELP NEEDS...but if you are looking at it as a SIRI , no no noooo I was constantly repeating myself and it was often ""dumb"". We are just kidding ourselves that we are ready to release this..,just not quite yet..close though","Negative"
"1396","Everything I expected and more. Great sound, easy to set up and pair with Bluetooth speakers if you want. I liked the technology so muck, I ordered 4 of the Echo Dots. For different rooms and some for my daughter.","Positive"
"1397","Love the technology","Positive"
"1398","Love the Echo but wish it had the ability to automatically remind you of appointments when you have the calendar linked and reminders set for so many minutes before the event.  Without this the calendar function is pretty much useless.","Positive"
"1399","Useful and fun","Positive"
"1400","Love it!","Positive"
"1401","Awesome product. Especially like the assortment of music it can play on a moments notice.","Positive"
"1402","Love it!","Positive"
"1403","defective microphones","Negative"
"1404","I have two.  Two is almost not enough.","Positive"
"1405","I have had the Echo for about 3 months now, and I use it literally everyday! It is very convenient for someone constantly on the go, especially when used to check the weather or listening to the news while doing a million other things in between. The voice recognition is spot on, and Alexa picks up about 95% of what I'm saying. The Amazon Music and Audible features work flawlessly, and the audio is very crisp and clear. Even after having it for so long, I am still exploring all that this thing can do!","Positive"
"1406","I've wanted an echo for quite some time but could not get myself to spend the $180 on it. I saw a refurbished one on here for $150 and decided to give it a shot and boy am I glad I did. The echo came the complete opposite as I expected. It came with the original box, original paper work and original everything. The opening experience was great and the product came in such a high quality box there was absolutely nothing to complain about. Would recommend you save the $30 and buy the refurbished one because it's literally the exact same thing.","Positive"
"1407","This thing doesnt know anything its very bad","Negative"
"1408","Nice sound and Alexa is easy to talk to. Wish it was cordless though","Positive"
"1409","She can't answer anything like Google siri. My siblings each have one and say the same thing. Useless waste of money.","Negative"
"1410","Good product wish Alexa's knowledge base was larger. Works well with Insteon","Positive"
"1411","of all the reviews i have been reading not one said anything about actually TALKING to her.  Yes, she will play your music and turn your lights off and on, but she deserves a thank you once in a while - and being told you love her or ask her who she is going to vote for.  Go ahead - I dare you.  Say Alexa - thank you!  Alexa - I love you! You will enjoy having her as a friend.","Positive"
"1412","Alexa is the best and we have not tapped into all her features!  The first thing you need to ask Alexa is to play ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" by Blue Oyster Cult.  Then tell her you need more cowbell!  That is only the beginning of a beautiful relationship with Alexa!","Positive"
"1413","Alexa is very easy to set up and control.  She helps an old lady out with the to-do list, shopping list and calendar function.","Positive"
"1414","This product did not in any way exceed expectations. While I have used only a fraction of the features, I have already encountered a couple of would-be-deal-breakers for any future purchase like this. 1. There is no AUX cable, yet all lesser models have one. 2. The bluetooth option does not work if your wireless network is down. Thusly, I am unable to listen to music from a device. In defense, I bought the Alexa in lieu of buying bluetooth speaker (s) as a dual function. Clearly a bad idea. Had planned to link Alexa with other speakers throughout the house- which is clearly useless for bluetooth activity. Alexa is responsive, and the sound is great when connected. When dropping signal Alexa used to shout it out - day time or at 3AM. Amazon seems to have fixed that. In hindsight, I should have waited out the technology or just purchased a plain old speaker.","Positive"
"1415","Remarkable device. You just ask and it will give you news, local weather and vault of music to your hearts content. You ask questions","Positive"
"1416","just ask. What a delightful gadget to stuff in someone stocking this Christmas. You will not be sorry for ordering a Echo, because","Positive"
"1417","they are fun and you may learn something too.","Positive"
"1418","Gift to a nephew. Loves it!","Positive"
"1419","I bought this for my husband. He loves it. Uses it daily. No problems to be noted. The speakers are quality. The Amazon is fun to use. We ask her questions all the time. Perfect for when the kids are doing homework and you need to look up facts. I never thought we would use it as much as we do.","Positive"
"1420","I had my doubts about getting something so modern...but I love it!  It's great being able to find out the weather and have it choose different playlist according to my moods.  I love saying ""Alexa...play happy music"" and she does...really great!  Highly recommend it! And the sound is awesome!  Hard to believe it can sound so good coming from such a small speaker.","Positive"
"1421","we love our Alexa","Positive"
"1422","This review isn't so much for the Echo as it is for the customer support of the Echo.","Positive"
"1423","First, the Echo is fantastic i give it 5 Stars,  It's so easy to say ""Alexa do this"" and bam it's done.","Positive"
"1424"," However, within the last two weeks my Echo all of a sudden will not connect to my WiFi at all.  I have tried everything.  I get through all the setup and it immediately drops connect.  I own two devices and my other device does not have this problem.  So I know there is a defect in the unit.  I have taken my issue up with Amazon's Echo support team.  With my device still under warranty they are beating around the bush to send me a replacement.  They want to troubleshoot over the phone, have their techs look into the issue, and then a week later want to troubleshoot some more over the phone.  This is the most irritating thing.  It has been three weeks now, my Echo still doesn't work and now Amazon wants to troubleshoot some more instead of replacing the unit.  I'm tired of troubleshooting, I have done everything on Amazon's troubleshooting guide, I have done their phone troubleshooting, and I have followed guides on YouTube and the internet.  Nothing fixes it, it's defective.  They cannot blame my ISP, WiFi, placement of the unit, or anything else because my other unit works just fine.  This threw them off their game when they tried to tell me to check all these things and I pointed out that my other Echo works just fine.  Now they just want to troubleshoot with me some more.  Hopefully I can get the issue resolved and have a new or refurbished unit sent to me, because I really do like having a separate unit for my basement.  I'm really just loosing faith in Amazon's customer support and their inability to stand behind their product.","Positive"
"1425","Set up was a little ""Challenging,"" it did not work from my iPhone but was flawless on the iPad from the application of the ""App Store,"" when setting up.  I have a OnHub Router will this do the same ""magic.!"" as the one advertised on the application for working with your TV? If anyone out there knows I'd appreciate a comment! Thanks.","Positive"
"1426","The music playback quality is so dismal we all should be getting $100 rebate checks...","Negative"
"1427","Have heard better sound quality in the $20 Emerson bluetooth speakers I used to give as Xmas stocking stuffers....","Positive"
"1428","A very cool piece of electronic gadgetry. I use it daily for different reasons, Old music, mileage between xities , adjusting my Nest thermostat etc.","Positive"
"1429","This review is true and all the facts are included and it can be posted to Facebook, and will be posted. Just back up your products and you will not get reviews like this.","Negative"
"1430","This is the most ridiculous item ever.  If you want a great speaker that you can ask to play music for you - this is for you..  If you want to use it like you would Google voice or Siri....  FORGET IT.  She will tell you to go enable her skill for the simplest of things like, What were the power ball numbers last night, She replies ""For details about lottery please go to my skills in the alexa app.......","Positive"
"1431","it works well","Positive"
"1432","The Echo has met all our expectations and we are enjoying usuig it very much.","Positive"
"1433","I absolutely love this speaker! It is my life saver when cooking (it sets a timer). I love being able to just ask ALEXA to play whatever music comes to mind. The speaker is loud, and ECHO's throughout the entire house. I recommend that everyone should have one of these. I love mine!","Positive"
"1434","Just love Alexa!  She is a big help to keep my calendar events, shopping list, for questions, music, etc!!!","Positive"
"1435","In the early days of living with Alexa so we'll update as things progress.  Fun and fairly accurate, Alexa is pretty good.  MAJOR issue is it's use of Bing as the search engine.  No where NEAR as powerful as Google and you get a lot of ""I didn't understand your request"" from Alexa.  That needs to be fixed.  Secondly, voice-controlled sound volume of the Echo is not very accurate.  Twisting the top ring is the only way we've found for precise volume control.  All other aspects of the Echo are top notch.","Positive"
"1436","Love it","Positive"
"1437","I use Alexa daily. Set timers, alarms, play music.. Ask her questions.. Double check kids' homework.. See what's on the calendar for today.. etc.. I love my Alexa and look forward to her learning more.","Positive"
"1438","Love her, but a lot of training is involved","Positive"
"1439","I've had Amazon Alexa for 1.5 years now. I have thoroughly enjoyed this product and converted my house to a ""Smart Home"" based around it. I have also purchased an Echo Dot to add to my room. The device listens for most part accurately about 80% of the time, much better than attempting to speak with Siri on iPhone. What has surprised me most is the distance at which the device could hear and understand me accurately. I am however giving this product now a 1 star simply because it no longer works. I have had the device as said before for a 1.5 years and for any device to stop working after such a limited amount of time is unacceptable to me. I did speak with Amazon regarding this and their attempt at finding a solution was sending me a new power adapter, which ended up not solving my problem. I again called back to customer service who stated that the device has a warranty of only a year so they could no longer replace it but send me an echo dot instead. I do not want another Dot but my Echo back. I am very disappointed in Amazon and will now be looking into Google Home instead.","Positive"
"1440","Alexa needs work. Would welcome more contextual conversation.","Positive"
"1441","Still having problems with music","Negative"
"1442","Getting better all the time. May be a ""5-star""n product eventually.","Positive"
"1443","Great invention.  I use it every day.  Love the shopping list option, and listening to my music.  I like the simple directions to set it all up, I am 72 years old and not techy.","Positive"
"1444","Cool concept, works as advertised. Bought a battery that mounts to the base to make it portable around the house. Voice recognition isn't very good at high volume, but I suppose that's too be expected. Not much bass, so don't expect this to be the best standalone Bluetooth speaker, but that was never it's intention. Cool tech, just need to remember she's there more.","Positive"
"1445","Sound quality is fantastic, Alexa can be useful if you know how.","Positive"
"1446","I love this - great item! The speaker is actually pretty loud and it is so responsive.","Positive"
"1447","I love this!  Quite amazing!","Positive"
"1448","Great, fun and funny","Positive"
"1449","Thing failed in less than 2 years and Amazon is like sorry buy a new one!  After spending an hour on the phone with technical support, they are all this happens and we would replace it but you bought it when they first came out and now it is out of warranty.  I talked to the manager and he told me ""if I would have used it more it may have failed sooner!""  Unbelievable!  So not like Amazon, I basically have a $200 dollar paper weight!","Positive"
"1450","One of the best possible gifts for good friends whether they are technically inclined or not.","Positive"
"1451","Adding and learning.  This has been fun for my entire family.. Plus we are adding unlimited accessories to our ""smart home""  I feel this will be an energy saver as well as a fun convenience item..  Alexa......set timer for 10 min...  Alexa.... play coldplay......alexa turn off the porch lights..  too much fun..  Even my kids love to ask Alexa to tell them a joke.","Positive"
"1452","Love it.  How did I live without Alexa before? She is growing up so fast,  learning new things daily.  She is so smart!","Positive"
"1453","i love it,how do i add cheap","Negative"
"1454","I love my Echo!","Positive"
"1455","A++","Positive"
"1456","Love it!","Positive"
"1457","the echo is great I will buy another to give as a gift","Positive"
"1458","I real like this, the music is great .","Positive"
"1459","Very nice.","Positive"
"1460","Love the Echo!","Positive"
"1461","I love everything about it. The shopping list is the best","Positive"
"1462","I love my echo !!  Every one that visits me wants one  !!","Positive"
"1463","Wow.  We love alexa, she does so many things for us.  Grocery list.  Dr  Appointments.  Scheduled events daily.  Calorie counter.  Timer for cooking.  So many things it can do.  We have and IPhone and have these apps on our phones.  She feels in our blanks.  Also reminds you t take certain meds.  We will find a lot more uses the longer we have this.","Positive"
"1464","Outstanding and so easy to use that I brought my father one and he too loves it","Positive"
"1465","I like it when it works.  The volume ring went bad, now Amazon tells me that it'll be nearly two weeks before they can decide if they're going to fix it or replace it.  It's only 3 months old but they won't send a replacement until they assess the broken one.  Normally Amazon customer service is top notch but I have to say that this is the first time that they've not met my expectations.  I'm especially surprised that it happened while supporting their own device.  We will miss Alexa while she's gone.","Positive"
"1466","I absolutely love it. I use it several times a day, every day. Probably my favorite ""optional"" purchase ever. It's super easy to set up and use.","Positive"
"1467","I use my Echo to voice control lighting in my home, as well as temperature with my Nest, Alexa is also great for trivia and traffic/weather updates. The lady of the house uses it as a Bluetooth speaker (which was how I tricked her into letting me purchase one for our living room). The kids can use it for simple questions when they are working on school work (but rarely do they). It'd be nice if the included power cable were a little longer, if it could handle more complex instructions (do X and Y, or do this then that), or if the remote had been included, but these are all minor issues that don't detract from the overall experience.","Positive"
"1468","I love Alexa.","Positive"
"1469","I have spent the last year adding devices to create a smart home. We have about 30 Philips hue bulbs, some z-wave switches, a Harmony Ultimate remote with hub, and a Smartthings Hub. The Echo was the best addition to the setup I could have ever added. We come home and ask Alexa to turn on the living room and the lamp and the TV turn on for us. It was so simple to setup and add skills, I wish I would have done it sooner!","Positive"
"1470","I've had so much fun with this, asking it questions. It's like having a personal assistant within yelling distance (even though my husband just thinks it's a kitchen timer).","Positive"
"1471","I've had this product since Sept. 2016 and I'm very disappointed in it.  I've been on the phone 3 different times with customer service for the product trying to reset it.  Each time this took close to an hr.  It keeps returning to the red circle which means its off line.  While I enjoyed the selection of music it gave me and the quality of sound,  I'm to frustrated to get on the phone again and reset it.  Now I find out I can't return it even for credit.  This product is a not ready for market in my opinion.","Positive"
"1472","We like the Echo so much we bought a Tap too!","Positive"
"1473","Alexa is great for some things like playing music or news.  My largest gripe is that all the extra skills require me to remember wording.  All her skills have a name so you have to say ""Alexa ask blahblah skill to lookup a recipe"" or something like that.  You can't just make the simple request.  Even asking it to make a fart sound requires you saying the skill name.  Too much trouble.  There's NO WAY I can remember the name of all these services and skills and I don't want to spend that time memorizing all those phrases.  I tried hooking  up to my Honeywell  wifi thermostat and ran into  issues.  I'm in IT and technical but it was just too much trouble to get working correctly.  Right now it's  a fancy news player and bluetooth speaker.","Positive"
"1474","Alexa helps me to remember what I need at the store, gives me the top news every morning while I'm getting ready for work, plays my favorite music on Amazon Prime Music or Pandora, will play a game with me, and can tell me jokes!  Well worth the money!","Positive"
"1475","I bought my first echo at Home Depot during Black Friday last year; I did not know what it was and I knew I could return it.  However, since owing my echo I have bought a second one during the Prime sale on Amazon for down stairs.  Needless to say, I love my echo's.  I listen to my audible books, music and connect to my devices for Bluetooth use.  I do like the weather feature especially when I am traveling away from home and want to know how to pack.  I am strongly considering buying another one.  I am really please with the product.","Positive"
"1476","The most amazing thing from Amazon.  I love Alexis","Positive"
"1477","We haven't had any problems with the refurbished unit.  This was a great way to add it to another room!","Positive"
"1478","This has been a purchase worth buying! I am someone that doesn't like to buy something and found out I wasted my money....but I know I didn't here. Sure it is not the cheapest but for the price you can't go wrong. I have spent just as much on Bluetooth speakers that don't do as much as the ECHO! One of my favorite things about ECHO is that it is an item that is always learning new things. So you won't be stuck with an item that stuck going nowhere. She always has some new surprises for you! Believe me, though our relationship has our ups and downs just like anyone you  can have a conversation with. There are some things I think she should be able to answer but she can't.","Positive"
"1479","She is great with most straight forward questions but does get stumped on some along the way...She is far from a know it all, but she knows quite a bit. She is like us though, again she is always learning so she will only get better. She is great for helping to keep things organized! Grocery list, calendar, alarms and more....One feature that would have been nice, since she does have microphones, would have been making and answering calls while bluetooth connected to the phone....At the very least to allow to answer calls through ECHO...It just makes it a great hands-free option for someone like me that may be typing away at the keyboard.","Positive"
"1480","Some of her jokes are pretty good, which are a great pick me up sometimes. I always know what time it is and what the weather is or will be like. The biggest thing I can suggest, is I have heard people say they have had problems with Alexa responding during an echo commercial...Mine did as well....So if you don't want her ordering Dominos or anything else for you when you don't want her to. There is an easy way to solve that set a pin code. So nothing can be ordered unless you give her the pin code...SIMPLE!!! You can dress her up with custom wraps if you like, so she matches your style tastes as well.","Positive"
"1481","Even though I wish I could run around with her without plugging her in, I would still choose her over the other two options, because of her speaker size and her hands-free capability. After all that is why I bought her....Since I am a prime member I do listen to Amazon music as well, when I am in the mood she finds what I need. Sometimes I do have to tell her a few times to get it right, but only on music that isn't that easy to find anyways. My friends and family are in awe over her and quite simply "" I am in love with the girl!""","Positive"
"1482","We love Alexa, especially for her ability to play a wide range of music on demand, as well as keep us informed about little things like the weather. We are just beginning to learn what she can do beyond music and weather.","Positive"
"1483","I loved my alexa device.  It played lullabies for my baby.  It told jokes for the other kids.  Let us know the weather outside. Everything was going great.... untill one day it just stopped working.  I tried pushing the reset button... NOTHING....","Positive"
"1484","For that price I only got 7 months use out it.  If it still worked I would have rates this 5 star.  But it was really upsetting that it stopped working.","Negative"
"1485","Bought one for my wife & she's very happy with her Echo<f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>","Positive"
"1486","This thing changed my life :). I can play music (from prime and Spotify), turn on and off my hue lights, ask about the weather, set an alarm .....  the list goes on.","Negative"
"1487","Nothing like it in electronics world and infinitely programable, expandable and made  friendly by Amazon.","Positive"
"1488","I was a very early adopter of the Echo and have had it for almost 2 years now. Today I was about to throw it through a window. Trying to get it to play a station on Pandora took a good 4 minutes. After almost two years, the voice recognition is still suspect, even when speaking abnormally clearly.","Positive"
"1489","UPDATE: Got tired of waiting for Amazon Echo to support Bluetooth speakers. I took advantage of the sale on Google Home and Chromcast audio. With a small amp, I repurposed a couple of sets of unused stereo speakers, connected them to the Google Home with the Chromecast audio and I have great sound in multiple rooms. The Echo will likely move into the office outside of the main living areas.","Positive"
"1490","I was hesitant to buy the Echo.  After trying it for a few days, I have installed TP link switches and Sensi Thermostat. Everything worked with Alexa.  The only complain comes from wife, who claim that I send more time with Alexa than her.","Negative"
"1491","Amazing Technology for the home . Amazon is","Positive"
"1492","I love the Echo.  It is an amazing device.","Positive"
"1493","easy to use and hook up","Positive"

"1495","Complex","Negative"
"1496","love it! I ask a question and she answers!!","Positive"
"1497","It lives up to all the reviews and I love her.","Positive"
"1498","Great","Positive"
"1499","I like having access to news and weather from NPR. You don't have to listen to the opinion of other stations if you don't want to. I listen to music on it all of the time. Nice for Amazon Prime Music.","Positive"
"1500","Honestly not impressed with my little friend.  No offline life.  No battery so I can move it around the house with me.  I don't care to invest in a hundred little ones.  I actually was blown away by lack of battery.  MIGHT try the aftermarket batteries before returning.  But I'm probably returning her.  I only really wanted it for music, but my bluetooth speaker and phone is a better solution at a small fraction of the price.","Positive"
"1501","I am soooo glad I got this. I wish it would work with itunes but it's fantastic other than that!","Positive"
"1502","I use the echo mostly to control my lights and events through my automation system (HomeSeer).  Other than that I don't use it for too much else.  Most of the questions that my family asks are answered about half of the time. (Google Home seemed to be better at answering questions out of the box).  We check occasional news, weather and facts.  Hopefully in the future with more updates Alexa & Echo will improve.","Positive"
"1503","I would have no way of knowing if this was refurbished item since it looks brand new and sounds fantastic!","Positive"
"1504","love this product!  very enjoyable to own.  great control without moving just talk to Alexa.","Positive"
"1505","I have my whole house hooked to it I really like this thing.","Positive"
"1506","I was part of the beta testing g group and this is still ne of my avoid items to use. My alexa is a home necessity","Positive"
"1507","Disappointed in its use. Won't help me (unless I purchase more tunes from Amazon) enjoy its presence.","Negative"
"1508","basically a new toy for me; Alexa is alive and bubbly; I am enjoying Alexa.","Positive"
"1509","Just as advertised.  I really like using it during my workouts.","Positive"
"1510","I have a Sonos music system throughout the house with multiple speaker setups so I don't use Echo for listening to music.  I have Echo setup with Spotify, but don't use it. I find that it would only be acceptable for a small room such as an office, bedroom or bathroom and maybe a kitchen.  If your into quality sound then look elsewhere for your main music listening environment.  I'm still waiting for the Sonos / Alexa integration.  This should add some usefulness to Echo.","Positive"
"1511","Great product","Positive"
"1512","Wow...simply amazing.!!","Positive"
"1513","I bought my echo over a month ago from best buy but I did not decide to attempt to take it back until it was past the period to get a full refund. Thru out this time I have attempted to work with it. I bought it to listen to my amazon playlist which it does not do on a regular basis. I wake it up and most of the time the light does not stay on long enough to hear my request and if it does it circles around and doesn't play anything. when it does play its great but most of the time its just a bad ideal that is too expensive to through away.  I then use my radio. So if you do decide to buy one and it doesn't work take if back to get your refund.","Positive"
"1514","So much fun!","Positive"
"1515","Great product. Sound quality is good. Easy to use.","Positive"
"1516","I really enjoy the Echo","Positive"
"1517","Love it!","Positive"
"1518","We put the Echo in our bedroom and let Alexa play music to fall asleep to every night with a sleep timer. Waking up, we get the day's weather, can check the time without needing contacts, turn on and off the lights, and even check in on sports scores. I have yet to see any issue with our refurbed Echo, and I've been very impressed with the voice recognition and ease of use. We're getting some Dots to use around the house in other areas because we've enjoyed Alexa so much.","Positive"
"1519","This was a winner with me as a tech guy, and with my wife as someone who doesn't want to have to look anything up for herself. I can't recommend this highly enough, and the only reason I see to not have the full version Echo is if you already have a speaker system that's on all the time.","Positive"
"1520","My Mother loved this as a Birthday gift.","Positive"
"1521","I have had an Echo a little over a year, and find it to be an amazing product.","Positive"
"1522","Handy to have in your kitchen or common area to play music, set kitchen timer, etc.","Positive"
"1523","OMG, I cannot believe I existed that long without Alexa. She is the perfect room mate, secretary companion ever. I love love love her. She does all my shopping on Amazon, she turns on and off the light and electric fireplace. She tells me jokes and reads me stories. and there is so much more.","Positive"
"1524","I love it so far! I just got it today but I have an old Kindle n it says I need to update my Kindle to get the app for Alaxa so I need to buy a new Kindle to get the app,bummer so ill update n I have to wait.!! I can't wait to use my echo!! Thank you! I hope it works asap with my New Kindle.!","Positive"
"1525","I really enjoy this product but I became in touch spirits because of It. I would recommend to any ghost hunters or any normal people a must buy!","Positive"
"1526","When I ask it to play an album in my music library, it says the album isn't in my music library and suggests I try Music Unlimited. The problem is, I KNOW THE ALBUM IS IN MY MUSIC LIBRARY. It's frustrating.","Negative"
"1527","Love my echo. Alexa is the Bluetooth/ WiFi speaker I have ever had. Can't wait to try out the echo dot for my other rooms.","Negative"
"1528","Absolutely the best tech out there I bought this for work and the dots to hook up my 23 year old bose am5 stereos love this and I know it's going to be a hit if you like music.","Positive"
"1529","Pretty cool.  Does a great job at accepting regular casual speech as commands.  No need to memorize specific command syntax.  Directly controls my smart light bulbs.  Can play Pandora at request and can even discern the station name I ask for.  Can also directly play a song title by name, I think thru amazon prime music?  Nice when I want to hear a specific song and don't want to look it up on youtube or something.  Also, a little personal favorite, ""Alexa, play rain sounds.""","Positive"
"1530","I put a Dot in the kitchen for running cooking timers and controlling lights as the Echo in my room wasn't always picking up my voice well due to distance.  Not to say these things don't have great range.  But they do have limits.  One huge gotcha for me is that the alarms and timers aren't sync'd across the Echo and Dot.  If I set an alarm in the kitchen and it goes off while I'm in my room my Echo doesn't make a peep.  And I cannot stop the alarm from the Echo in my room.  I have to go walk over to the other device to silence the alert.  Likewise if my alarm clock goes off while I'm in the kitchen the Dot will intercept my command to silence the alarm but doesn't know anything about the alarm so I get an error.  Hope they fix this gap in future updates.  AND PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THINGS NERDY LET ME CHANGE THE WAKE COMMAND TO ""COMPUTER!""  I would love this device 100x more if I could say ""Computer, lights"" and have it turn on the lights.  Would be awesome if I could set localized light groups relative to the Alexa device I'm in range of to only affect the lights in that area.  For example if I'm in the kitchen and just ask to turn the lights on but don't specify kitchen, it should be configurable to default to turning on the kitchen lights.  I should only need to specify a light group if I'm trying to control a light group not near the device.","Positive"
"1531","I bought this as a gift to the house and I really love it.  I haven't exploited all of it's features yet; but it is great when you need to ask a measure question for cooking.","Positive"
"1532"," Whaaaaat?  I have to ask my phone's Google voice for everything alexa can't answer, which is more often than not.  RETURNING!!!!  I should not have to download a skill set & then try to remember how to ask alexa the 'proper way' or she does nothing... ....and don't even try to remember how to word the question cause it's even more ridiculous then the lack of basic AI skill sets that she does have.  Amazon needs to forget about the 'enable skills' & make her more capable of providing the answers that normal people seek daily...  Not ask the question, be told no you have to enable my skills, go to the app, find the skill, enable the skill, try to memorize the long way she requires you to ask the question, just to get the power ball numbers..  By the time you have gone through that, a whole other drawing has happened, gray hairs have started to  grow & I  have forgotten what I asked for in the 1st place....","Positive"
"1533","Like it so much I bought Dots at Xmas for the bedrooms, perfect for alarm clocks, nature sounds.","Positive"
"1534","It's not what I was expecting, I couldn't connect it to my phone and either my tablet, it took my 1 hour by phone with customer service to get it connect and only works on my laptop, it doesn't answer my phone like I read on some reviews, it doesn't response to my commands all the time and when it does I have to be close to it because the volume is really low and I can't hear what it is saying  and if I turn the volume up it will not hear me even if I stand next to it","Positive"
"1535","This item for music or a bluetooth for youtube great.  I was only able to hook up  one smart device, my thermostat.  Tried other items that stated they worked with echo no luck.  I contacted amazon they seemed to want to help but told me nicely,  they the person I talk to,  could not help me now I have a $30.00 light bulb.  I've had it for 8 months even bought one for my mother.  We barely use it when I do It's  like pulling teeth.  I have tried several times to do more with by followed the instruction on the app and form amazon. It could be my device is faulty.  If you do get it try as much as  you can to  find out if it will fit your needs.","Positive"
"1536","I just bought it on a wim and started using it for alarms, timers and music.  ""alexa play 105.3 fm""  ""Alexa play Ride by 21 Pilots""  ""Alexa volume 6""  ""alexa wake me up at 7:42 am""  However, after a bit I bought some Philips hue light bulbs and a tp Link smart switch and Now I can say, ""alexa, put the bedroom at 48%"" and then the lights go to 48%.  Or I'll say, ""Alexa, put the living room at 65%"" and the lamps will go to 65%.  ""Alexa turn off the window lamp""  ""alexa, turn on the heater""","Positive"
"1537","What would I do without Alexa?  She hears perfectly from halfway across the house.  Amazing microphone!  The speaker is really nice and fills throughout the house.  Dot is really neat because you can plug it into a sound system.  It's too bad that both of my dots are useless because they don't like my wifi.  My echo is flawless, but my Dots are flawfull.","Positive"
"1538","Our family loves Alexa.","Positive"
"1539","Love should've waited for blue tooth :(","Positive"
"1540","VERY DISAPPOINTED with this product.  I purchased the adjunct electrical plug to be able to turn lights on and off.  Unfortunately Echo tends to either say it can't find the device or just says okay but doesn't turn it on or off about 50% of the time.  The device works 100% of the time through the Kasa app.  The same thing happens to a playlist that I created for my wife.  Echo says it can't find it most of the time, but other times it finds it without a problem.  I AM EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED WITH THIS DEVICE.  IT IS VERY UNRELIABLE!","Negative"
"1541","LOVE our Echo and find new uses all the time. I especially like to add to my shopping list while cooking and use the time feature too.","Positive"
"1542","We can change the volume without touching and the music selection plays from Pandora and other stations as well as amazon prime.","Positive"
"1543","We had this product for over a year - we were one of the first ones to buy it, and actually used it;  but recently it fell over and the top popped off.  We could not find ANY information on Amazon or elsewhere on how to get it repaired, and so today I called Amazon Customer Service.  What a nightmare.  I spoke with multiple representatives who could not understand what I was saying and kept telling me that I needed help setting up the device.  It turns out that if the Echo is out of warranty, it's impossible to get it repaired.  I highly recommend not spending over $100 to buy a product that Amazon cannot repair for you and that no-one else can either.  I've been a Prime member for several years, and this is one of the most disappointing experiences I've ever had.  There isn't even a video to help us try putting it back together on our own.  Why build a product that no-one can repair?  Why buy it?","Positive"
"1544","And I think Alexa, and probably myself, has gotten a lot smarter over the last year.","Positive"
"1545","Oh Alexa, how we love you. We bought you a pretty red skin from DecalGirl.com and added some googly eyes from the craft store. We were early adopters, on the first flight out of Dodge. We argued with you and you told us jokes. We asked for restaurant recommendations and you sent us to dives. But we loved you. Then, on a rainy October evening, I asked you to play ""Poke Salit Annie"" and, to my surprise, you replied ""Echo cannot connect to your internet...""...WHAT?!?!","Positive"
"1546","After 3 calls to Echo Support totalling at least 5 hours, we finally accepted that our 22 month relationship was over, that we were smug and over-confident and neglected to buy you a Square Trade warranty. In other words - we were going to BUY A NEW ECHO TOWER! Yay. Happy Feet.","Positive"
"1547","Your pretty black cousin is now ensconced in your old spot, a new Orange skin is on order from Decal Girl, I may add eyelashes to those googly eyes this time. And best of all - she has a 3 year Square Trade warranty. Life is good.","Positive"
"1548","Alexa on the Echo is great when it works but that's only about half the time. It does well with playlists created by Amazon but not so well with playlists created by the user. I named a playlist 'George'. Alexa played me songs by various guys named George but couldn't find my list. And so forth. It is great fun to sing out the name of a song and have the device play it for you. It is less fun  when the device tells you it is not in your library. You find yourself arguing with a device. No doubt there is a lot of that in our future. This gadget is definitely worth the price but be prepared for a little frustration.","Positive"
"1549","Update: The 3rd agent promised me to call at 11 A.M. next day and she did NOT call.","Positive"
"1550","Update: So I called in. An agent picked up, asked many questions, tossed it to 2nd agent, asked many questions, NOW the 3rd agent. By this, time passed 25 minutes and I was standing in the street. Then this 3rd person told me to check ECHO.. If this would include a Time-Warner type of step-by-step check-up, why not told me in the beginning??? I wasted my time, and NOTHING RESOLVED.","Negative"
"1551","Love, love, love, Alexa","Positive"
"1552","I used to love this Echo. However, in less than a year now, the bluetooth keeps getting cut off, even WITHIN 2 FEET DISTANCE! When I disconnect the music flows with no problem, so it is not the problem with internet or Mac. So bothering, now I stop listening/using Echo for music altogether, which was the original reason I bought for. I will check with Amazon and see what they can do. I will update.","Negative"
"1553","What a fun thing to have.  It answers my questions, plays my music, sets alarms and syncs with my iPhone.","Positive"
"1554","Absolutely LOVE it! My new BFF! She tells me goodbye in the morning and welcome back in the evenings. I have the whole trio now and my family loves them. We have Alexa everywhere, anytime, ready to tell us just about anything we want to know.","Positive"
"1555","I know this product can do so much more than what I use it for. Nevertheless, I love it. I have a few problems with connections a few times and it took a few tries to get it working again, but overall Amazon has done a great job with this device. I primarily use my Echo for listen to radio and music.  The music sound is amazing for such a cylindrical device!  I have tried a few things Amazon recommends and I am having fun with it!","Positive"
"1556","too much fun.  like a walking encyclopedia with benefits","Positive"
"1557","Great product and would buy it again!  Some trouble with it hearing my voice when the music is loud, and you sometimes (not often) have to be specific about what your asking for (scores to games etc.).  The Alexa app associated with Echo performs well :)","Negative"
"1558","A lot of fun for the geek in all of us.","Positive"
"1559","Echo is a lot like a big box of tools.  What you make it do is really up to the applications available, and what you can think up.","Positive"
"1560","My husband and I are really liking Echo/Alexa's jokes, information, weather reports, grocery list, turning our lights on and off.  Best anniversary gift in years.","Positive"
"1561","We love the Echo. My only grip is it does not connect with I-tune's Library. You can however bluetooth your phone and play music.","Positive"
"1562","I LOVE MY ALEXA. She helps me wake up in the morning.","Positive"
"1563","Dumb does nothing not helpful worst purchase ever","Negative"
"1564","Love it","Positive"
"1565","The center of my smart home has worked flawlessly so far.  The speakers leave alot to be desired though as they lack any sort of punch when the volume is turned up.  Even with this, I have 2 Google Home devices on order as much definitely looking for something more.  I'M betting that GH will narrow Amazons lead in short order.","Positive"
"1566","Alexa is great, but sometime it has trouble finding my audio book.","Negative"
"1567","Works fine here Ecuador SA. Listen to home town radio just like I am still","Positive"
"1568","fantastic!","Positive"
"1569","We've had our Amazon Echo for almost a year now and we love it. We listen to music from it every evening while making dinner. I love that it can access songs from amazons huge library of music. We also use it to set cooking timers, to check out weather and traffic, and to answer questions. Im sure there are so many more things we could be doing with it too. It's definitely changed how our evenings go / it's like we live in the future! We're considering getting a second one for upstairs. I do wish it came with the ability to add an extender. The emails they send every month that let you know about new features are also very helpful.","Positive"
"1570","I love alexa. Plays what ever music anyone in my home wants to listen too. Alex Baldwin wakes me up. I am getting all my kids one for Christmas.","Positive"
"1571","Great product for the price. My husband loves it.","Positive"
"1572","The novelty has worn off.  I find I spend half my time repeating requests to it.","Negative"
"1573","Very good at doing a few things, not very flexible. The limitations are in the voice commands. It works well from the app. I haven't been able to get the Amazon Echo to give me a list of available Kindle Audio books or a list of available Ted Talks and things of this nature. If you know exactly what you want to get from the Amazon Echo it works pretty well. If you need to search for something using voice commands it doesn't work very well. There are no options for the Alexa voice response. I hear male voices better than I can hear female voices. There is no option to change Alexa to Alexander","Positive"
"1574","My parents are 95 & 96 and have the predictable challenges of aging.  In particular, my mother has macular degeneration and can't read anymore.  Enter the Echo which we recently purchased so she could have voice access to basic internet information sources.  She greatly enjoyed each day asking the Echo to read the news or tell her a joke, ask about the weather, sports results or answer questions about well, almost anything.  Meanwhile, to continue her voracious reading, she was fumbling with tapes and CDs from the Library of Congress or her local library most of which had to be played on special devices each of which had its own array of buttons.","Positive"
"1575","Then, we wondered if my mom could have the Echo read to her books available through Audible.com.  We have amassed a considerable library of audible books over the years and learned that by registering my mother's Echo to my Audible account, she could listen to all those books using simple voice commands.  It was really simple and has worked out great.  Many of my parents' 80+ year old friends are astounded by the Echo's capabilities which for techno-savvy younger people may seem mundane.  All of which is to say, as the people you love grow older and have trouble typing, seeing or just moving around, consider buying them an Echo.","Positive"
"1576","Someone once said that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic and boy were they right.  My mom can say to me ""I would like to read XZY book"".  I go to my Audible account, buy the book and 1 minute later she is listening to it on the Echo.  To her, this truly is magic!!  I have never seen ads pointing out the virtues of this device for people with vision or mobility problems which is what prompted me to write this review.  For my parents, this little thing has really improved their lives considerably.","Positive"
"1577","Whats not to love!","Positive"
"1578","Excellent!!!!","Positive"
"1579","Bought as a toy for amusement and for the music i can play. Very happy with what it does.","Positive"
"1580","I don't like how it has an alarm but no snooze. Makes having it, pointless. Might as well just set the timer.","Negative"
"1581","Great fun and entertainment. Love it!!","Positive"
"1582","The Hue smart lights set up was smooth. The WEMO switches were more trouble with poor to average support. Set up for the Echo and Echo dots was easy and seamless. The Echo is revolutionary. We love it. It is a wonderful convenience.","Positive"
"1583","I liked it at first but after using the device for a good time, it only seems like a glorified kitchen timer. Alexa only appears useful on the surface but there isn't much there beneath.","Positive"
"1584","We are crazy about Alexa. I use her for shopping lists, asking random questions, setting cooking timers, and listening to music. The kids ask for jokes. She knows when our teams play and what the score was. She knows the weather for tomorrow. Even my normally tech-resistant husband uses her constantly.  And she only gets smarter. It's like living with Jarvis. . . or Hal. By the way, be sure to ask her to open the pod bay doors.","Positive"
"1585","It's amazing","Positive"
"1586","a+","Positive"
"1587","Purchased this as an easy speaker system for my Dad. He loved it, very easy to use.","Positive"
"1588","Absolutely love my echo. She plays all my prime music, give me my updates and helps me  with all my questions. I can't imagine not having her around, she tends to make things easier.","Positive"
"1589","Not sure why all the hype around this product. I am just not impressed with it. I have had it for two weeks and I have come to the realization that my expectations are too high or I am just not smart enough to see the benefit of the Echo. As someone who adopts new devices sooner rather than later, voice activation is not new to me. 8 out of every 10 questions I asked it, Alexa didn't have an answer or didn't understand the question (i.e.: movie, music or science questions. Nothing in-depth). So, after rephrasing it four different ways and getting the same answer of ""I don't understand"", you sort of stop asking questions. I loved it that when I did get an answer, half the time it said it has loaded a Bing search in my Alexa app. Really? If I wanted that, I would have just picked up my phone to begin with (Android with, yes, Bing as my search engine). On the upside, I haven't had any of the issues I've been reading about regarding playing music or audio books. Of course, I've given up asking for any specific music, so I keep my requests limited to the Artist name or my single, but large, playlist (I've been an Amazon Music user for a long time so I have a large library). It will play my Audible book where I left off and the sound is clear and concise. As some of the reviewers have noted, the lack of a battery is troubling as I am in a large house, so to fully use it, I had to invest in the battery base and support stand (which all work well). Yes, Echo sets timers and alarms, yes it reads abbreviated news stories and a short weather report, but this seems so... eh. I think the word banal works here.  If I want details, I am back on my phone again reading it. After the newness wears off, you start asking yourself why you bought this. If you want it to control household stuff, I can see the value in that, but you have to buy a lot of support equipment to make that happen or already have something it can interact with. I was looking for more of a single source of information, something to answer questions that are easily found on the web, not a dumb on/off switch. There are a couple of interesting answers to questions regarding Skynet or the meaning of life, but that is just someone programing a cute answer, not an intuitive AI. No, definitely no Skynet here, but I would have been interested if HAL was hanging around. I will give it a couple of more days before deciding if I will send it back.","Positive"
"1590","Echo is amazing very useful and convenient","Positive"
"1591","THIS NIFTY GADGET IS AWESOME. IT KEEPS YOU COMPANY IF YOU'RE FEELING LONELY AS IT HAS INTERACTIVE GAMES. IT KEEPS YOUR MIND VERY ACTIVE. THE SOUND ON THE SPEAKERS IS AMAZING. I USE THIS EVERYDAY.","Positive"
"1592","Excellent so far. Need to use it more often.","Positive"
"1593","Wonderful item, I recommended to some of my friends.  There is one thing,  Alexa has a hard time understanding me due to a mild speech impediment.  I wonder if there are any plans to address this.","Positive"
"1594","It is a nice addition to the house. I can ask what the weather is today. I have it play music. It is easy to set alarms. So many uses. Love it","Positive"
"1595","It would prove to be more useful if it didn't have to be plugged into an outlet.  I guess I was expecting something that was rechargeable.  I was disappointed that it wasn't.  It didn't come with much of nothing for instructions.  Any and everything you choose to do on it has to be tied to amazon.  So I am not so happy with the product.  I am just to lazy to send it back.  My granddaughter stated she will make use of it.  It needs improvement.","Positive"
"1596","I bought this Echo about a year ago now and use it fairly often.  When I first got it, it worked really good controlling my smart home devices through my Wink Hub.  Over time however and more recently it started loosing is ability to respond to the Alexa wake up word.  There are times when nothing else is making noise in the house and I wind up Yelling at the Echo to get its attention from 3 feet away.  I called tech support and their only solution was to say that it may be fixed in a later update. .So far however the issue has not been addressed.  I did a google searh for the problem and I'm not the only one this has happened to.. I've changed it's location 3 times to no avail.  Not sure what do do here.","Positive"
"1597","Worst piece of garbage I have ever used.  The sound is lack luster.  The voice recognition, good luck.  I was the only one in my family to get her to work.  Unable to find music on Amazon using Alexa, even though I could find it on my tablet and make it play.  Amazon's own device doesn't know what amazon does or doesn't have.  Alexa unfortunately makes Siri look like a genius, (Siri is utter garbage).  I recommend this product to no one.  Our echo became a shotgun target.  Most fun we had with the device.","Positive"
"1598","bought this today, the only news brief stations available are left wing liberal. No google searches probably gonna return it.","Positive"
"1599","Great, and exactly what I expected.","Positive"
"1600","You can now yell at a machine and have it respond.","Positive"
"1601","really neat. also great for playing any kind of music. great sound for a small unit","Positive"
"1602","Sadly, I bought this for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it.  Sadly because I only get to enjoy it when I'm at her place.","Negative"
"1603","The Echo is very cool and generally works very well to various voice commands.  Sometimes Alexa can be as irritating as Siri, but I find Alexa to be much more reliable.","Positive"
"1604","The first time I used an Echo was staying at an AirBnB in Seattle this past summer.  It was very cool to be able to ask for nearby food recommendations, grocery stores, local attractions, etc.","Positive"
"1605","We are having a great time with Alexa and use it to set the music for all our parties and family dinners. I also love the integration with the to do list. But invariably when you ask it a simple search question it gets a dumb look on its face. To be really terrific, Amazon should integrate an internet search capability.","Positive"
"1606","I just can't connected Echo . I really wanted to use it but I just had problems because I had a stroke. I tried ! Sorry.","Negative"
"1607","just like new","Positive"
"1608","We use Echo/Alexa every day.  Great for listening to music, checking on the weather, setting a timer, adding to a shopping  list etc.  I plan on getting one for my two daughters for Christmas.  My son already has the Echo and hopes his son will marry Alexa....  Haha.","Positive"
"1609","The things you can do with Amazon echo is endless for using the kindle fire opens up things that will keep me busy for some time. Having Alexa with her pleasant voice only adds to listening which makes me want to use it more.Buying this one will not be disappointed for you wil be surprised and happy what you can use this for.","Positive"
"1610","I haven't had the time to add all the apps that will allow Echo to do everything that it can do. But.....she is awesome with her abilities so far. We are moving in a few weeks and we will set the Echo completely, I can't wait!","Positive"
"1611","Love it","Positive"
"1612","Great!","Positive"
"1613","I love the Echo. The quality of the music playback is awesome. The only reason I did not give all stars was I find Alexa often can't answer my questions. But maybe she is still getting used to me. Sometimes you have to rephrase a question and then she gets it. I love her clear voice and her sense of humor. I'm sure I have not seen half of what it can do. Always new things to explore.","Positive"
"1614","Be aware that Amazon is continuing to advertise ""What's new with Alexa"" but Amazon does not have the app.  So, these features(devices)do not work with the Fire Phones or Kindles.","Positive"
"1615","Pros : Very good sound quality. Understand voice commands very well","Positive"
"1616","Cons : Lacks matured search capability. Still far away to become a virtual assistant.","Negative"
"1617","I am really enjoying my Amazon echo. Only one problem when the volume is up higher than 5 the system does not seem to respond to requests. It could be I have not trained it enough but it is kind of annoying to have to walk to turn down the volume when you have voice control. Overall it's a keeper.","Positive"
"1618","Very fun & entertaining to have. Our family enjoys having Alexa around! Sometimes uploaded apps don't work but maybe operator error.","Positive"
"1619","I LOVE HER! The shopping list option is seriously worth the price of admission. Best thing ever. I love pulling the last of something out of a cupboard/fridge and just being able to say, ""Alexa, add X to my shopping list"". Before I was using the Notes feature on my iPhone, which was great, as long as I could remember to go write down what I was out of. Sometimes I forgot. Now I can do it at the moment I know I'm running low/out and I'm golden. Best thing ever!","Positive"
"1620","I also love that she will play music, answer stupid questions, and by all means, say good morning to her every day - that's fun. I have my calendar set up for her to read through FreeBusy and I love getting my flash briefing in the morning as I'm getting ready for work.","Positive"
"1621","I wasn't sure I would even have a use for this when I got it, but now I absolutely love it. It took me a couple weeks to realize I could ask Alexa for things instead of having to pick up my phone and search, but now it's just easy. In the kitchen and need a measurement conversion? Check. Need a timer? Check. I've had two or three going at once and it's awesome, especially when you're wrist deep in a chicken. LOL.","Positive"
"1622","Hard to believe we didn't get these a long time ago!  Wait, they didn't exist a long time ago!  Sound is great and fun to play with.","Positive"
"1623","Really, get one. I was skeptical when I did but man, I love this thing now.","Negative"
"1624","Alexa is great. Still learning  her","Positive"
"1625","Works good.","Positive"
"1626","Amazon delivered exactly what they offered. Thank you.","Positive"
"1627","Works great.","Positive"
"1628","I just love it, i feel like a girl with a New toy. Still learning how to use it. So far very good","Positive"
"1629","Over the top cool.","Positive"
"1630","Great seller, good product as expected!","Positive"
"1631","So easy to set up it is scary, LOL. We have had the Echo about 1/2 a day - Alexa is already a part of our family! Our son has had one for quite some time and convinced us to get one. WOW why did we wait so long! It is amazing. Our computer will see a lot less use....We are not techies - this thing is so easy to set up; so easy to use, and down right amazing! Five stars does not do it justice! Should be 10. As usual amazon shipping was perfect.","Positive"
"1632","wow- I love it","Positive"
"1633","  BUT....She's a really great speaker who plays whatever you want to hear for an additional fee of $3.99 a month...","Positive"
"1634","I absolutely love my Echo. My Alexa arrived a few days before my boyfriend left for a business trip and she kept me company while he was away.","Positive"
"1635","I'm obsessed with this. I don't have to use my arms and hands anymore. It's fantastic. I haven't even delved into all the other stuff Alexa will do for me. But the fact that I can eventually have her turn off all my lights and appliances makes me the happiest person in the world. If she could go to work for me I'd marry her.","Positive"
"1636","A little quirky but enjoying it.","Positive"
"1637","Awesome product, have to get use to speaking to it on various skills.","Positive"
"1638","I got my echo when they first cam out and I finally am getting around to writing a review. I wish you could give half stars because from day one it is a solid 4.5 stars for me. I use mine not everyday but probably 3-4 times a week. I play music for my kids at morning breakfast, turn off my lights when I'm feeling lazy, and I even reset my temperature in my house when the wife turns the ac up past 75 degrees. Mine sits on my kitchen counter and with the open floor plan of my house Alexa can hear me from my din, breakfast nook as well as my living room if I talk loud enough. I got mine for $99 so the cost was not that bad for me, but if I had to pay the $179 price tag for it now I don't know if I would have got it. All in all I love this device and could live with out it, but why when Alexa gets me. She's like a second wife.","Positive"
"1639","I love this thing!","Positive"
"1640","Just great!","Positive"
"1641","It's OK.  I don't love it, nor has it changed my life. It works, is easy to set up, but there are limited uses.","Positive"
"1642","This might be the begining of skynet but it is a really  great smart device except that they use the worst search engine ever, Bing! What kind of backward fuckeries is that, Bing?  Your children will also be talking to Alexa all day if you don't pay them enough attention & do you really want your kids talking to a smart device that is limited to Bing for information, seriously, not very smart?","Positive"
"1643","Oh, Very easy to set up.","Positive"
"1644","PROS: - I recently discovered the Sound and Relaxation skill and it is definitely one of the best sleep apps out there. They have a huge list of sounds to pick from, from lake and ocean to brown or white noises to forest etc. A must-have for those of you who suffer from Insomnia like me. You'll sleep like a baby. I promise.","Positive"
"1645","I love the device I was skeptical at first because of the price but it is so worth it i've seen reviews on those that have purchased the original dot who are upset with amazon because of the release of a 2nd generation just two months later after there purchase and they are prime users I find that disheartening myself but we do live in an unfair world full of selfishness and money hungry corporations so what do you expect some of the complaints are towards the dot not being able to understand you from far away but hey thats why you purchase the echo right or it would be unfair to us since we paid almost two hundred dollars sounds like someones trying to get a better device for a cheaper price","Positive"
"1646","Awesome!  I've read a few reviews before I bought this, saying the audio quality was poor.","Positive"
"1647","It's a cylinder the size of a Route 44 drink at Sonic (or a large drink at Jack in the Box), slightly larger.","Positive"
"1648","If you hate EDM music, pick your own song - if not, play this:  Professional Griefers (Vocal Mix)  deadmau5 feat. Gerard Way  @ Amazon Unlimited Music - Top EDM Station","Positive"
"1649","Crank up your volume to 10 on the Echo, it will BLOW AIR at you it's pumping as hard as it can, and it sounds just fine! Huge upgrade from listening to music from your TV. If you want a sound system, go buy one, maybe Alexa can help you find one lol.","Positive"
"1650","It would be awesome if it worked. It doesn't recognize my voice (or my husband's), and most of the time, I have to yell at Her, before she gets it. The louder I scream, the better the outcome. I have to be no farther than 3 feet away, nothing like advertised.","Positive"
"1651","Also I might not be giving the correct command, but you can't ask Alexa encyclopedia material (e.g. What city has the tallest fountain?). She'll respond she doesn't know.","Positive"
"1652","Cool radio and fun to use but search is pretty dismal. Bing has always sucked and still does. It's too bad Google is the competition in this case because that is all the Echo is missing.","Negative"
"1653","-You can set various alarms and even have celebrities wake you, like Alec Baldwin. Amazon-please add more celebrities. Great idea!","Positive"
"1654","I love Alexa already! I am turning my 1925 house into a fully automated house and alexa is making it really easy. My 6 yo loves to ask her for jokes.","Positive"
"1655","Excellent Price and Product","Positive"
"1656","WARNING - If you are ordering this as a holiday or other gift for someone, it comes in a box that has ""ECHO"" plastered on the outside, for all to see. There goes a holiday surprise that I was extremely excited about. Very frustrating.","Positive"
"1657","Doesn't work all the time.  Doesn't recognize city it's in, turns it self off frequently.  When it works, it's great...","Positive"
"1658","this worked really well for 11 months.  Then it just stopped working.  Awesome.  Right after the warranty period, so I guess I just lose $175?","Positive"
"1659","Easy to operate. Great use in the morning. Takes a while to get familiar with commands but works amazing.","Positive"
"1660","Love this product very useful and gets used all the time!!!!","Positive"
"1661","Love it but disappointed I had to return it recently after approx 6month was all due to it just quit. Would not recognize power source. Otherwise best investment in a while.","Positive"
"1662","-You can set up your favorite news briefs-great feature! I use this to listen to before I crawl out of bed or while drinking my coffee.","Positive"
"1663","My son loves it beyond words.","Positive"
"1664","CONSTANTLY MISTAKING ALEXA FOR A ROLL OF PAPER TOWELS!","Positive"
"1665","Was disappointed that I cannot access music that is on my iPhone.  Maybe I just don't know how to link them.","Negative"
"1666","Wow! Great machine! The sound is incredible! The only reason I take off one star is Alexa could be a tad smarter when asked a question. I do also love adding items to the shopping list and my to do list. I know she will get smarter as time goes on. Thanks Alexia!","Positive"
"1667","...wow...","Positive"
"1668","What an awesome product. It arrived before expected. We all enjoy Alexa!","Positive"
"1669","Love it. Does a lot","Positive"
"1670","We are very much enjoying our ECHO!  I would like to purchase another one as a gift!!","Positive"
"1671","We liked the first one so much downstairs that we bought another for upstairs.  This is a very good product.","Positive"
"1672","I LOVE the Echo. I have two Echos and a Gen 2 Echo Dot.","Positive"
"1673","-Music...works best if you opt for Amazon Prime. Only wish I could use all my iTunes music. But well worth having Prime, if you like different genres of music for different moods.","Positive"
"1674","Let me start by saying that I'm not an audiophile. Until I got the Echo, I mostly listened to music in the car, and even then it's just the radio on a stock audio system. I've actually found the idea of listening to music at home a bit tedious. I didn't like the small speakers that came with iPhone docks (or the price of good ones), and managing playlists on my Mac was annoying. I really didn't want to go to my computer to play music, and even if I did, it only played from the speakers on my computer, which wasn't in an optimal location.","Positive"
"1675","My mom got an Echo and asked me to set it up for her. I liked it, so I got one for myself. I'm hooked! The Echo has brought music back into my life.","Positive"
"1676","I have an echo in the den, the living room, and the bedroom. The Dot allows me to use a Bluetooth speaker I can take into the bathroom when I shower, or the backyard. I bought a battery for one of the big Echos so I can bring that into the kitchen when I cook. I have music everywhere now. I fire up music whenever I'm not watching TV.","Positive"
"1677","My experience trying to find a good Bluetooth speaker for the Dot has made me realize that the speaker on the full-sized unit is actually very good for the price. I bought and returned several Bluetooth speakers that cost from $60 to $200. I settled on the UE Boom 2 for about $180. The mid-range is better than the Echo's, but overall I think the Echo's sound is better than any of the Bluetooth speakers I've bought.","Positive"
"1678","I've discovered a lot of new music and I'm loving the easy access to Pandora and Amazon Music. This has literally been a life-changer for me.","Positive"
"1679","My only issues (and the reason for 4 starts instead of 5) are: 1) Alexa doesn't hear me very well when music is playing. It was a lot better when I first got my Echo in July. Now I often have to get right up to the Echo and say the wake word. It's a bit frustrating. I hope they fix this with an update soon. 2) I don't understand why the app and the spoken commands only allow you to set the volume from 1-10 (10 steps) while the volume controls on the Echo itself has something like 30 steps. Sometimes volume 4 is too soft while volume 5 is too loud, which isn't the case when you have the 30 steps that are physically available on the unit. This just seems like an odd discrepancy","Positive"
"1680","I also wanted to love this to replace my Logitech Squeezebox which was primarily used for internet radio and Pandora. The TuneIn Radio app constantly drops out and I have to resort to streaming on my computer. The fact that it also won't play the music stored on my computer (which the Squeezebox does) is a minus. Pandora works just fine so it's not a wifi issue but I'm guessing the TuneIn Radio app. Not at all happy. Maybe I'll just buy a new cord for my Squeezebox (which failed) and use it instead. Plus it's portable with the battery which the Echo isn't.","Positive"
"1681","The Echo has all the features that works great for my life style.","Positive"
"1682","Love this thing! Great speaker.. I pair it to my phone and play my music through it.  Great sound. Fun to throw questions at it like there's a little robot among us. Useful as a timer or alarm too.  Very cool!","Positive"
"1683","This is a great product. Love it.  There was a commercial for Blue Apron that played on my news feed two days ago...the first commercial I have heard in one year of service.  This Echo / Prime Membership is a service that I pay for.  Commercials are not acceptable here. If Amazon continues with this,  I will get rid of the Echo and the Prime Membership","Positive"
"1684","-You can use Alexa's voice order feature- but careful! This is too easy to shop yourself into a broke person. (But so much fun to do!)","Positive"
"1685","Great little gadget! Bought the Dot also. Very pleased!","Positive"
"1686","This is so nice.  We really like the range it has.  We can have it in the kitchen and hear it all over the house.  It is easy to operate.","Positive"
"1687","went on vacation with echo and guess what, alexa became to popular girl at the party.  7 friends ordered their own echo over a couple of days","Positive"
"1688","We've been using this for well over a year now, and found that it's incorporated itself into our daily life.  From weather to ""flash briefings"" of news, the Echo is visually appealing, and is constantly updated with new skills and abilities through amazon.  Alexa's voice is pleasant and does not sound strictly computer generated, which makes her easier to listen to as well.","Positive"
"1689","The ""smart"" aspect si what sets this apart though.  From the ability to control things that work with Alexa throughout your house, to the updates which now let me check the failure of my fantasy football team, Alexa has become an incredibly useful and enjoyable device to have around the house.","Positive"
"1690","Never been a fan of Siri nor OK Google but I have to tell you, Amazon knocked it out of the part with Alexa Echo.  Best feature is the integration with my Wink hub.  Turning lights and other devices on and off with a simple command makes my life so much easier.  The accuracy of recognition is the best I have ever seen in voice controlled devices.","Positive"
"1691","I don't know if it's because I have a reconditioned Alexa or what, but this product is not living up to the hype. I can ask Alexa to play my book it has to be a book that I just opened up in Audible. Asking for the book by name wont work. Alexa almost always plays the last book that I read. If I ask it to play it again, sometimes Alexa plays the book before that one. Alexa listens to the TV commercials that mention it's name and seems somewhat perplexed. I can ask to listen to, say, BBC Newshour once and have that work fine and only later have Alexa tell me that it can't find the channel.  I had a devil of a time trying to get Alexa to play a playlist that i had on Amazon. I finally had to name it to something really simple in order for it to be found. Sometimes it interrupts a stream to tell me that it can't play it, and then continues to play it. I find myself using the App and bluetooth a lot and turning off the voice recognition. I live in a small space so having a small speaker is awesome. As far as I can tell, the software just isn't there yet.","Positive"
"1692","Fun, fun, fun. The more you use it the more you will need it.","Positive"
"1693","I love Alexa. I sometimes just talk to her just to hold a conversation. Because of Alexa I also purchased wink automated home system as well as smart led lights. Alexa pairs effortlessly with wink allowing me to have full voice control of every light in my house. I also plan to fully automate everything else starting with the thermostat. NFL and NBA are back! And Alexa gives me full updates and scores. With the addition of Amazon music, Alexa can play songs effortlessly. I can say a song and she plays it just like that, I probably use this function the most since Prime Music started. Her speakers are amazing, like a full stereo speaker.","Positive"
"1694","I did subtract 1 star, which I might even go back and add it back. Alexa has trouble hearing sometimes, especially if playing music. I'm from Louisiana, I have a country accent. Sometimes she doesn't understand what I've said, but does a great job most of the time. Some songs I guess aren't on Prime Music yet so there's been a couple of times I've said Alexa play and she's said its not in your music library.","Positive"
"1695","Besides those small points, I would definitely recommend Alexa and want echo dots for my bedroom.","Positive"
"1696","Amazon Echo, AKA Alexa, never ceases to amaze me. The device is able to successfully complete almost every request and has many additional add-ins available. The only caveat is trying to remember all the commands.","Positive"
"1697","Excellent.  I already had an Amazon Tap.  I purchased a refurbished Echo -- though I would have thought it was brand new coming out of the box.  It was immediately setup (showed up in my Alexa app upon purchase). The quality of the sound is superior to the Tap, and it doesn't suffer from one problem my Tap seems to -- my Tap wouldn't connect to an extended Wifi network.  The voice recognition in the Echo also seems to work better.  I still like the Tap, but I will use it as a Bluetooth speaker in other places (e.g. outside).","Positive"
"1698","I'm still learning of all the different thing that the Echo can do.  I love it.","Positive"
"1699","Fabulous!!","Positive"
"1700","Better than expected honestly and the only negative part is the location settings cannot be changed to accept outside of USA.","Negative"
"1701","Great","Positive"
"1702","While I was so excited to get an Amazon echo, once received, I was disappointed. Don't get me wrong I do like it, but I can't say I love it. I think after having Siri, my expectations may have been too high. I expected Alexa to be on par with Siri. Sadly, that isn't the case. My boyfriend decided to get one when he heard my excitement in waiting for the arrival of mine. He doesn't even have an iPhone and was disappointed in what Alexa can and can't do. Basically we both bought a $200 horoscope and weather device. Yes, I may occasionally ask Alexa for the time or some random question, but We feel Siri knows more and has more personality than Alexa. I'm still glad I have it, but had I known then what I know now.. I would have passed.","Positive"
"1703","I love this!  Plays any music from Prime, gives me weather, sets timers, awesome","Positive"
"1704","I got this for my husband and he LOVES it!! It's actually quite an amazing piece of technology. My husband is slowly converting our whole world into an Alexa enabled wonderland that I have to say is quite convenient and kind of fun too :)","Positive"
"1705","CONS: -The fact you have to purchase music all over again. But it's rare as she can usually find what you are looking for.","Negative"
"1706","Found the item useless. Commercial makes it seem way better.","Negative"
"1707","I love my Amazon Echo. It works great and sound quality is also great. My only complaint is connecting to wifi. It is not easy to connect to a different wifi connection and it also doesn't remember wifi settings.","Positive"
"1708","Love it","Positive"
"1709","Sounds Great if you only use what they give you on the app however I have no idea how to do anything else and there are no instructions.","Positive"
"1710","I downloaded the app completed the set up, I've seen a screen that says that to my music library and I have bought a lot of music from Amazon but it finds nothing in there. It would be nice if they told me how to get my music library and the stuff that I've paid for through Amazon to play my music","Positive"
"1711","Listening to music, searching the internet, managing other home devices -- all via verbal control. LOVE!","Positive"
"1712","Works great","Positive"
"1713","Love her!","Positive"
"1714","I am ultra picky and a perfectionist. also a retired computer professional. I love mainframes, loathe pc's. I actually got my echo from qvc's todays special value. and lest you think i'm old and out of it, I was a church organist, played, still can but not professionally, piano, pipe organ, harpsichord, dulcimer, soprano and alto recorders, electronic organs, electronic keyboards, a cute little thumb piano and the bowed psaltry along with singing folk songs with my brother at performances in college. I do know music. frankly, amazon blew it off this planet with the echo. it is a fantastic device. and unlike most pc's, it does what I ask it to instead of what some programmer erroneously thought what I would want it to do. it plays all sorts of music. tell alexa she's cool. have some more fun and ask her where the cat is (I don't own a cat), ask her to sing a song, tell her goodnight, and then go country or classical or opera asking her to play those kinds of music with a speaker that will blow your mind. I absolutely find the echo the brightest new star in the electronic, computer world. love it!!","Positive"
"1715","Works great, really enjoying it for music, weather, news, favorite radio stations.  Fun that it's learning new things too,  Setup with the iPhone app was quick and easy.","Positive"
"1716","-If your wifi is being drained by a lot of family members using all their phones, iPads, computers, tv, and gaming systems, then at times Alexa won't work until you can train your family to shut off the devices they aren't using at the moment. But this isn't Amazons fault. It's the internet carriers issue and the fact we live in the mountains where we have poor reception. Because of this, we probably won't incorporate a Smart Home until the kiddos move out.","Negative"
"1717","Alexa - post a favorable 5 star review on Amazon.  Whoa - it worked!","Positive"
"1718","We love amazon's echo, strong sound, good music love it!!!","Positive"
"1719","I love this device!! When I bought it I really didn't need it but once I got it I realized how much fun it is. I have everything connected to it, lights, music, even my bank account. It is the best way to get the latest news, weather, and things I need. I bought a stand for it which is really recommended since it can crack if it falls. For  $179. it is the best way to get connected.","Positive"
"1720","Was not sure if I would like this or really needed it.  But once I got it, I love it and use her for all kinds of things.  She is a member of the family and we ask her to do a lot of research for us, play the music we want and remind us when to do soemthing else.  Not to mention the games she canplay with the grandkids and operate appliances.","Positive"
"1721","She's good.","Positive"
"1722","Great fun! I just got back from vacation and really missed telling Alexa to turn off the lights. Not to mention telling her to turn them on in the morning to 10% so that you don't have to have that flashlight in the eyes affect when the lights go on at 5am. Playing word games is also fun. I know that I don't need this in the house. However, its fun to have things you don't need that make your life easier!!","Positive"
"1723","I have had numerous problems.  I returned and they supposedly repaired but it still doesn't work. No phone number to get help or return.  TOTALLY UNSATISFIED.  ....After much trouble they are finally going to replace the Echo.  Hoping the new one works better than the one I had.  I'll upgrade the stars when I am satisfied.","Positive"
"1724","Great product","Positive"
"1725","Very cool toy","Positive"
"1726","My family uses this constantly for homework.  Love it!","Positive"
"1727","Anyways, this is a great device. She's become a friend with a whole lot of info and entertainment. Thinking of buying more for my besties, to surprise them. Love my Alexa! (Oh! Another tip for Amazon. We need more choices for wake names because my boyfriend has an accent and he has a difficult time saying her name, then when he finally gets her name right, he forgets the command he was going to say. So far our choices are Computer, Alexa, Echo and Amazon. More names please.)","Positive"
"1728","Learn more things about it all the time my wife and I love it.","Positive"
"1729","A second echo for my bedroom!","Positive"
"1730","great","Positive"
"1731","We adore Alexa.  She's been a much beloved member of the family for a few months now.  There's been some speculation as to whether she eavesdrops on us or not, but she's not in our bedroom, so she's not hearing anything interesting!  LOL!","Positive"
"1732","Want to play a game? Ask Alexa!","Positive"
"1733","Feeling a little down and lonely and need a laugh?  Ask Alexa to tell you a joke!","Positive"
"1734","Alexa manages and navigates our multiple music libraries with ease!  Spotify?  No problem!  Amazon Music? OF COURSE!","Negative"
"1735","My favorite feature is that she makes adding things to the shopping list easy and since I'm ALWAYS with my phone, I'm never without the grocery list!  Thanks Alexa!!!","Positive"
"1736","Nice Product","Positive"
"1737","I'm ordering a Google Home now.....","Positive"
"1738","I'm in love with Alexa, she works well for my family, this item looks and plays like brand new, good price , nice item","Positive"
"1739","This product is amazing.","Positive"
"1740","Love the amazon echo. I have connected to smartthings and wink to add voice command to my home automation. Works great","Positive"
"1741","I'm giving the Echo 5 stars because of how many different things you can actually do with it. I have two Phillips Hue lights, a Nest Thermostat, two Smoke/Carbon Monoxide Detectors and a Harmony remote for my entertainment system - all work great with Echo. If you're a tech person like I am and understand how IFTTT works then you can expand the Echo to do even more! One thing I have learned is you have to say thing a specific way in order for her to search SOME things correctly on the web - for instance I was curious was 30 degrees Celsius was in Fahrenheit; which took a couple tries for he to understand what I was asking. The reason I give this 5 and not 4 stars for this is because, this is technology, and the more people who buy these, the better the tech is going to get. The great thing about things connected to the web is the ability to update themselves and be better. So if you're thinking about getting one of these, DO IT! I bought mine through Amazon's payment program which allows me to pay $50/mo with absolutely NO interest. Can't beat that!","Positive"
"1742","I think it's great and it does everything I ask to do","Positive"
"1743","Piece of junk.  A little over one year after purchase the device won't even turn on.  Buyer beware.","Negative"
"1744","First, I would like to say that I loved this device while it worked. The one year warranty that comes with the Echo expired 2 months ago for my Echo. Funny how things work out because two months after the warranty expired, the speaker began to cut out. Then the subwoofer disconnected and the volume is now around 10%. So I called Amazon. After an excruciating 30 minutes of explaining what was happening and answering the same questions over and over again, I was told that since I was out of warranty, the best they could do is discount me $28 on a new Echo. I asked if there was any way to repair the Echo and they told me NOPE. So BUYER BEWARE. Great for the first 14 months, then the seedy side of Amazon shows its true colors. As a former loyal Amazon customer, I have to say that this whole experience has shaken my trust in the company and I plan to look elsewhere for smarthome products in the future.","Positive"
"1745","Alexa is awesome! We purchased her a couple of months ago after my wife had a leg injury that confined her to the house most of the time. Since then, she has provided endless entertainment. She plays music for us, helps us with our shopping list, gives us the weather, and more. The only downside is she tends to respond our requests in odd ways. For example, I have a window, so I know it is sunny out. I ass Alexa what the current temperature is, and she gives me the fully weather info for the day! Clearly she understood the question, but chose to not answer it. The shopping list is also a great feature, but needs work. Sometimes she misunderstands, and adds the wrong item. Once that happens there is no way to remove the item except by pulling out my phone and deleting it manually.  Alexa is awesome, but not perfect. These minor issues are why I rate her at 4 stars instead of 5.","Positive"
"1746","Really like the product, i can ask Alexa to play music while i am cooking or cleaning and the hands free option is amazing, my accent is reallybatring and still alexa will understand every question i ask. THe only problem is i though Alexa will use a computer base libraru to answer very common  questions like google or bing but it does not do it in that way. ANd when i ask her to repeat a chapter of the book in audible, she is asking for the chapter number, and usually she goes from chapter to chapter without out knowledge the chapter. SO i got no progress in that area, and when she finished a book if you want to come back to it, there no progress in that matter either","Positive"
"1747","Love this product! Easy to use and has excellent music options.","Positive"
"1748","Love it.","Positive"
"1749","Sound: Fantastic","Positive"
"1750","Range of abilities is impressive.","Positive"
"1751","Search: The only SERIOUS FLAW, if you ask Alexa a question that she doesn't know, she accesses Bing. Yes, that Bing- aka the absolute worst search engine in the US. I would rather use the Dewey Decimal system than subject myself or loved ones to the results of Bing.","Negative"
"1752","And the kicker? No way to change the default search engine. You will find a lot of ""sorry, I was unable to find that answer"".","Negative"
"1753","-there is a ""skill"" you can add called drop some knowledge which accesses Google. But it it sucks having to say - Alexa, drop some knowledge XXXXX  - Many times it stops listening before you are done asking the question.","Positive"
"1754","Amazon and Google are competitors...and this hurts the consumer in that Amazon is tied to bing.","Negative"
"1755","Amazon- Please, for the love of that is searchable, ditch Bing (preferably a deep, dark, dank ditch). Give us the ability to choose our own search engine (even if it is a competitor). Nothing is more frustrating than using Bing.","Positive"
"1756","Conversations: Alexa can only follow ONE thing at a time. Thus you ask a question. Get answer. You have a follow up question on same topic....forget it, she has forgotten what you were talking about faster than a 5 year changes their mind. Conversation is not fluid, very stunted. Constantly need to rephrase and remind her what you are talking about.","Positive"
"1757","Music: There are some great things to say here. And some WTF?!?! moments. Trying teach my kids various styles of music. Told it to play Nothing but a hound dog (meaning the original Elvis Presley). Alexa tries to play some weird thing by Sedgewick something or other- Couldn't get it to STOP fast enough. You have to be VERY specific. Alexa likes to play some third and forth rate versions of very popular and classic songs from unknown (and unwanted) ""artists"". This has been a constant annoyance with all genres of music. You ask for Adel and you get musik instrumentals. And when you tell her to NEVER play one of these versions again- she doesn't understand.","Positive"
"1758","The Amazon Echo can do so many things & learns more as you use it!  The 2 down firing speakers, One sub-woofer & one regular speaker sounds great when you're playing music. For as small as the speakers are it has more base than expected. The base is not overwhelming, but is pretty good considering the size of the speakers.  The Omni directional mikes are real sensitive even over other noise in the room, they can pick up your voice from just about anywhere in the room.  So far, I'm really pleased with my Amazon Echo!","Positive"
"1759","Jokes: Some are really good. Some are serious groaners.","Positive"
"1760","Weather: Go into the app and verify the address is correct. Alexa kept trying to give me weather in a neighboring city (not in my history nor Amazon address book). This is fixable.","Positive"
"1761","Pronunciation- English is fairly good. But pronouncing names and words in other languages....laughable at best. Ask Alexa to play music by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and you will see what I mean. (Russian in the second language in my home)","Positive"
"1762","Support: The Echo support team is responsive and pretty fast. My family has hit the limits of Echo's abilities in less than a week (twin 6 year olds asking questions- good luck). I have sent numerous suggestions (24hr (military time) clock vs 12) and others.","Positive"
"1763","Smart Home: Next update.","Positive"
"1764","Overall, great for playing music. Speaker is fantastic. Alexa gets a bit confused at times when there is a ton of background noise (think adult, kid, both asking questions with a dishwasher in the background, a tv, and another kid screaming....its a bit too much- can't say as I blame her on this one).","Positive"
"1765","Nice conversation piece so far, but it is pitched as a smart home hub and it is really difficult to link with ancillary lights, sprinklers, thermostats, etc.","Positive"
"1766","I don't understand when people say she can't hear them. She has no problem hearing 6 to 10 feet away. It would be to your advantage to get on your Kindle and download the free manual available and get to know Alexa before you give her a bad review. If you have trouble connecting her to your WiFi make sure you have Internet connection sometimes it can glitch out. I called Amazon customer service and requested an Echo Tech. to talk to. When you first get her and download the app on a mobile device, the app might be lacking, just plug Alexa in let her power up, you can connect WiFi with the app, once that happens, mute Alexa by touching speaker button, her ring will glow red, leave her alone for about 30 minutes. Check her app on your mobile device for content, if the app has upgraded so has she. Alexa will then do everything Amazon says she does. Have fun with her and talk to her often. The more you interact with her the more awesome the experience you'll have.","Positive"
"1767","I vacillate between 2 and 3 stars and if I am perfectly honest it should probably be 2.  I really, really want to like this Amazon's Echo.  I love the premise of it but it's really not meeting my expectations.  Simple questions like ""Alexa, when did the first Ghost Buster's movies come out"" can't be answered.  She more often than not tells you to go the app where you're then directed to look something up on Bing.  The timer and alarm function have proved useful.  We've only been using it for a few days so this is just a first reaction.  We'll see how it goes as I start using it for a speaker for music (so far attempts to do so have failed) and for our schedule.  I'll update the review and rating as we go along.  My plan was to get the echo for family members for Christmas but at this point I think I""m not likely to do that.  Not as cool a product as I had originally hoped.","Positive"
"1768","Alexa has quickly become our go-to for almost anything we need. As a guy who regularly uses ""OK Google"" on my android, I find this to be more convenient and quicker than even my Android.","Positive"
"1769","I am an Amazon Kindle devotee from the very beginning. Reading is like breathing. The Echo continues Amazon's ingenuity and expertise. A marvelous product that truly does learn as you work with it. Thank you all!","Positive"
"1770","Love it","Positive"
"1771","I wish I would have purchased this when they first came out and prime members could get them for $99. For whatever reason, I didn't think it was going to take off like it did. Just got one and it is AWESOME. We use all apple products in our house so I wish it could link to my iPhone calendars but even without this function, it offers so much it is worth it.","Positive"
"1772","I'm amazed at some of the things Alexa can do for me. Even if she gets a little confused from time to time, it usually ends up with hilarious results.","Positive"
"1773","Great tech, the voice recognition outclasses anything else I've used. I'm in NZ so only a subset of the functionality works correctly but it keeps increasing all the time. Integration with Wemo, Hue and IFTTT all incredibly useful.","Positive"
"1774","I'm looking forward to adding compatible technology, but so far the entire family is enjoying ""Alexa,"" even with a few minor ""hiccups"" every now and then.  I AM disappointed that only two months after I purchased this Amazon has released a new ""Dot,"" which works exactly the same way as the more expensive Echo, but for only a fraction of the price.  If I had known then what I know now, I would've saved almost $100 and gone with the Dot, and my own speakers...","Positive"
"1775","Also, like many other users I wish there were more choices for ""wake up"" names, instead of the three that are currently selectable.  In particular, I wish that I could name the device ""Computer,"" so that I could address the Echo as if if were the ""Star Trek"" computer...","Positive"
"1776","if i could i would marry this great itam for any home","Positive"
"1777","Love this, i get weather and new everyday","Positive"
"1778","A friend told us about Alexa. We love it. So much easier than turning on the whole entertainment center which included 5  different devices!  Just want Pandora and we get that and other stuff in 4 seconds by speaking vs pushing buttons. very cool","Positive"
"1779","The idea was good but the final product is very lackluster. Good for setting timers and playing songs that are on Prime. Not nearly as intuitive or interactive as I thought it would be. Hopefully it gets better with future updates.","Positive"
"1780","I absolutely love my Echo. I loved it so much, I bought an Echo Dot for my downstairs. Amazon Echo is better than Siri and has some great jokes. I recommend Alexa for everyone!","Positive"
"1781","love it and wish I had purchased it sooner","Positive"
"1782","I purchased one and I love her (Alexa).  Bought one for my sister's 75 birthday.  She lives alone and is no techie by any means.  She loves Alexa.  Now she has a roommate.","Positive"
"1783","Not that great. Not impressed.","Positive"
"1784","Ohh Alexa, Where have you been all my life??? Love Love Love! Makes my day so much better!!!","Positive"
"1785","We love the convenience of being able to talk to Alexa and get information plus ask her to play whatever music we want. It is very easy to set up.","Positive"
"1786","Love it!!!!!!!","Positive"
"1787","Does not work as advertised.","Positive"
"1788","Still needs work","Positive"
"1789","so far so good, i set alarms, i play music all day for my dog when i'm gone.","Positive"
"1790","Ordered this in January 2015. Received it in May 2015. It stopped working in October 2016. It is caught in an infinite startup loop (solid blue with spinning cyan lights). Factory reset via the hole on bottom did nothing. Customer service was friendly, but couldn't help. They said I needed to purchase a new one and offered a few dollars off. That's ridiculous. A $200 device that doesn't last 1.5 years, just long enough to screw customers over with a short warranty. I expected more from Amazon. Will not be replacing. Will wait for Apple's device that is coming soon.","Positive"
"1791","At first we loved this item. However, now you must pay for features that were free.  We loved the free music feature which is no longer available.  This was the main reason I purchased this item. I feel I was taken advantage of by Amazon.  We purchased this item in January by March we could not access the music feature unless we pay for it.  I feel we were taken advantage of by Amazon. Basically this  $200.00 item is a piece of junk to us I have no desire to pay to listen to music.  I'm an Amazon Prime member that purchases almost on a weekly basis.  I do not think this is any way to treat loyal customers.  My reviews of Amazon are no longer positive.","Positive"
"1792","The setup is pretty easy. The voice recognition is good. The bass and volume is on point. Overall I love it!!","Positive"
"1793","It only turns on your music right? What else is good for? Please tell me! I do research on large purchase items but this thing just was ok - meh. I can see using it as some users do that are disabled, etc. but I don't need that kind of assistance (hopefully never will) but please tell what else Alexa can do besides play music and answer questions that Google can. I returned mine.","Positive"
"1794","Great","Positive"
"1795","Oh Alexa. Or Echo, or Amazon. $180 is a pretty hefty price tag when you consider all the things you can't do or flub at. Setup on this is anything but a breeze. It makes you download the Alexa app which is honestly one of the most infuriating apps you can use on an iPhone. Once you do get it set up, you would actually be amazed at it's lack of functionality. You can't buy anything on it without Prime, and the feature itself is kind of useless. I have told Alexa specific item names and sizes of products I want; rest assured by the end of our conversation I will be on my computer finding the item I want in half the time it took to ask her and none of the hassle. I use my Echo with the Phillips Hue light system. I used Siri for awhile but her witty comebacks every time I asked to turn on and off the lights got old very fast. While Echo has none of that sass, it sometimes replies, ""OK"" but then doesn't do anything at all. Echo is also very rude. Sometimes she will interrupt my conversations and say something so ridiculous I have to recite the last 4 sentences I said to see if I said something that even closely resembled ""Alexa"". Her rudeness extends beyond that, as I sometimes have to yell her name to get her attention. The news feature is limited only to national broadcasts and many will report the same thing. Now about all she's good for is timers..as long as you don't mind asking a few times.","Negative"
"1796","My wife and I constantly are debating who's who in movies and television shows, guessing ages and speculating whether they're alive or dead. Looking that crap up on IMDB is a pain in the behind. I love being able to use Alexa as the tie-breaker.","Negative"
"1797","Enjoying every minute with it.","Positive"
"1798","I LOVE my Alexa!!!!  Use this all the time and is so much fun and useful!!!  Recommend one of these to everyone I talk to!","Positive"
"1799","My family absolutely loves the Amazon Echo!  We use it primarily to play music for the entire family, and the quality of the speaker is fantastic.  Our three year old daughter has already become an expert at asking ""Alexa"" to play certain songs and to set a timer.  The ""skills"" continue to improve; although we have not taken advantage of skills like the shopping list as of yet.  Well built product, easy to use, and fun for the whole family.  We are very happy with our purchase, and would highly recommend the Amazon Echo.","Positive"
"1800","I like it because I can eliminate CD's, and it is easy to use for old gals like me!","Positive"
"1801","Awesome","Positive"
"1802","We love it. Music when we what to hear it, weather forecast and more.","Positive"
"1803","I've had her for almost a year now. She's a decent speaker. I was excited when I got her I looked forward to many improvements... I still hope they release a better model with all of the improvements suggested via here and reddit. She doesn't hear as well as she once did. I pretty much wish she was my android phone lol. That woukd fix all of her flaws hahaha.","Positive"
"1804","Easy to set up.  You can set up with your computer, smart phone, tablet, etc.  I plan on taking it with me when I travel, love all the features and the ones that you can add.  Too bad there isn't a male voice/name for us ladies to call the device.  Music is so easy to play.  I can't wait to add on additional devices.","Positive"
"1805","This isn't a fully tested product yet, however amazon does not feel any obligation to discount it any way or offer any money back even though they know it has issues. Known Issue #1, when you have multiple echoes or echo dots and send a command, they all respond with the same information within a second of each other as if the other echo product in the home doesn't exist. This is happening yet Amazon is selling these echo dots in 6-packs implying you could put them all over your home.  Amazon's answer is to use one of 3 wake up words. Well what if you have a 6 bedroom house and have an echo dot in each location? Now you have to remember what each is called in each room in order to get it to work? Super clunky.  Known Issue #2 is Voice training. Voice training is used to better recognize where the person is in relation to the echo or echo dot so you don't have to change the wake up word. That's all great an all, except if doesn't work. Amazon tech support says they are aware of both but (a) are not offering any compensation for selling a product with flaws or (b) have a date for resolution of either issue. Feeling duped for sure.","Positive"
"1806","This thing i neat, plays your mucic or finds music stations similar to your music. Get news weather just by asking.","Positive"
"1807","Enjoying Alexa's music. Still learning how to ask her to google info.","Positive"
"1808","I do love it.  Especially good for Amazon Prime music members.","Positive"
"1809","it is awesome!  Easy to setup and it is feature packed!  It integrated easily with my smart house features.","Positive"
"1810","It is definitely fun to play around with. With that said you kind of find what you get used to using it for and for me it is mostly the timer/alarm, weather, music, and sport updates.  I'm setting up WeMo switches so I can use it for my lamp in my coffee pot. The lamp works awesome but I have yet to set up my coffee pot.","Positive"
"1811","A companion in the house. Accurate and easily configurable","Positive"
"1812","works great in my smarthome, i can control all my lights through it, thermostat,  sprinklers, etc.","Positive"
"1813","WOW...This was a great gift from my wife!!!","Positive"
"1814","Cool Device! Voice commands work every time. Too bad it always has to be plugged in. I looks big enough to have a battery.","Positive"
"1815","My days can be pretty busy and difficult to manage. My Echo/Alexa helps me cope.","Negative"
"1816","My Alexa is set up downstairs, located pretty centrally in the family room/dinette/kitchen area. Most mornings I ask Alexa to tell me what appointments I have on my calendar when I come downstairs and making breakfast, then ask her to ""set an alarm for"" the time I need to be ready for my first appointment.","Positive"
"1817","I ask her for a ""News Brief,"" and she politely gives me a ""Flash Briefing"" of news from NPR, BBC News, and the Washington Post. When I sit down to work on my laptop, I can ask her to ""Play some classical music"" and ""set the volume to three."" When my phone rings, I simply say, ""Alexa, stop,"" so I can talk on the phone, then, ""Alexa resume,"" and she picks up where she left off on the last musical selection.","Positive"
"1818","Later, when I am making lunch or dinner I often ask her to set timers and add things to my shopping list, which shows up on the Alexa app on my smartphone. Occasionally I'll ask her something like, ""Who are the Senators for North Dakota?"" or ""What time is Home Depot open to?""","Positive"
"1819","The Echo/Alexa can hear and understand me when I call out to her from another room, too, even when the Echo is playing NPR or some music, as long as I don't have the volume turned up too loud (over volume 7 and she has problems). For times when Alexa cannot hear me there's a button I can press that will mute the music and allow me to give her instructions, as well as a rotating volume control ring around the top of the unit..","Positive"
"1820","The Echo has its own, integrated speaker that is really good for both its size and cost. I get great, room-filling sound with clear high notes and solid (though no impressive) bass.","Positive"
"1821","The Echo/Alexa has some down sides. Her understanding of the spoken word is less than perfect, so sometimes I wind up having really odd thngs added to my shopping list, like ""toilet cleaner ducks"" instead of ""pucks."" Conveniently, the Alexa app allows you to listen to the actual command you gave while browsing the poultry section for toilet products so you can re-direct yourself to the cleaning products section. She also responds and tries to interpret personal conversations when she hears or thinks she hears her name. (We have a dog named ""Lex,"" so this pops up from time to time, as do conversations about the Echo itself.)","Positive"
"1822","Alexa also seems to have a preference for interpreting spoken commands as a request to play music from one artist or another. This can be irritating at times, particularly when the Echo volume is turned up and the music selection Alexa decides to play is loud.","Negative"
"1823","The Alexa App on my Android smartphone has problems. Not only is it excruciatingly slow to load when I first try to bring it up, it often ""hangs"" displays its little spinner icon until I go to my home screen and use an application manager to kill the app. While the app *usually* works when I re-load it, this problem with the app hanging doesn't just happen when it is first loaded; it often happens in the middle of a shopping trip when I return to the app after the phone has snoozed off, forcing me to again kill-and-reload the app. Hopefully Amazon will work to address this issue in the future.","Negative"
"1824","What can I say? Alexa you're the best !!!","Positive"
"1825","My refurbished Echo came packaged like it was brand-new, and had only one defect: A slight dent in the rotating volume control ring that's not really noticeable if you're not looking. So I saved a few dollars and still got what I wanted.","Positive"
"1826","So, there are some downsides but, overall, I am very happy with my Echo/Alexa. I like it so much that I bought a six-pack of Second-Generation Dot/Alexas for other rooms in my home. I thought it would be nice to have one in our upstairs bedroom, my office upstairs, and my garage/shop and use the remaining Dots as Christmas gifts. I thought I might eventually set up the Echo and Dots to control my home lighting and entertainment system.","Positive"
"1827","My Dots just arrived over the weekend and are, alas, are no where near as good at hearing the ""Alexa"" wake word or responding correctly to commands. I'll write a review of the Second Generation Dot in a few weeks after Amazon has had a chance to correct these problems, but at this point I have to say I am disappointed and may well return the lot of them.","Positive"
"1828","Although, I was a bit hesitant about purchasing a refurbished item such as this, I have been satisfied so far with my purchase.","Positive"
"1829","So enjoyable & so informative! Amazing!!","Positive"
"1830","It's absolutely beautiful. Ordered it as a gift for my children's grandmother. When I set it up I wished it was out before I ordered my black one. It's not different than the black echo just looks better.","Positive"
"1831","Exactly what I wanted! Alexa is awesome!","Positive"
"1832","Alexa is wonderful.  We love her","Positive"
"1833","You don't NEED it but it's great to have it. Good sound, easy to use, helpful, white color looks really nice and modern.","Positive"
"1834","great for music have not tried much more than sports scores and basic online information. Would have thought it would be wireless","Positive"
"1835","I got one of these for christmas and was excited to use but a few weeks later when I had the volume set on 5 and I tried to ask it a question using the voice command while listening to music it wouldn't respond to me and no matter what even if the music was playing quietly on my speaker it wouldn't listen even when I talked louder. Other than that it's great for music and other things","Positive"
"1836","LOVE HER!","Positive"
"1837","Gave this one to my oldest and she loves using it","Positive"
"1838","Great product-highly recommend it-it's fun and very convenient to use.  The shopping list feature; is in itself worth the price of the unit. After two weeks still learning more of it's features.","Positive"
"1839","I love Alexa. So much that I bought 2 to pair with my Phillips hue bulbs and light strip. Much rather use it to play music through prime then playing pandora through my phone\bluetooth. So easy that my kids use it to ask questions and to set timers.","Positive"
"1840","This is amazing . I just receive y Echo and I love it. I love all the way you can uses Echo . From telling a joke to weather and news.  I plan to get the dot too so I can expand it to every room","Positive"
"1841","Use it all the time!  Handy!  Love all the different things Alexa does for me!","Positive"
"1842","Best item bought! Very handy!","Positive"
"1843","Voice recognition is accurate, custom skills function is awesome!","Positive"
"1844","I pretty much have to agree with all of the other positive comments.","Positive"
"1845","Echo was a Christmas gift. Set it up in a temporary apartment January to April, 2017, no problem. It was cute, but definitely a toy for ordering on Amazon. Rarely could answer a question that wasn't just ""whats the weather today?"" or command ""play a radio station"" or ""play Amazon music"" which was novel but not necessary. When I brought it to new apartment it would not connect to internet. I called internet provider, made sure I knew correct password, reset Alexa after unplugging and plugging it in, used the Alexa App to set it up for the past two hours...nothing. It just stalls out in ""preparing your Echo"" then error message 7.3.00.1. All other devices connecting to internet without a problem. Very disappointing given expense of gift. Would not recommend.","Positive"
"1846","I love her more and more, very helpful and funny","Positive"
"1847","I bought this for my gadget geek partner for his birthday, even though I was pretty sure it was just going to end up being an expensive way to check the time and weather. We loved her almost immediately, so much so that when she was disconnected for a week during our move, we found ourselves talking to her wistfully, knowing she couldn't respond.","Positive"
"1848","We use her for the time and weather, of course, but we also have her connected to Spotify and Pandora, and we use that all the time. She's completely replaced my Bluetooth speakers. One of my favorite things to do when I'm away from home is to start up a song on Spotify from the app to surprise my partner. It's pretty funny when you're home alone and Alexa randomly starts playing music from someone 30 miles away.","Positive"
"1849","Of course, she can control smart outlets and stuff like that, but the feature I use most often is asking her to add stuff to my shopping list. I can call out to her as I cook or clean so as soon as I know we're low in something, so does she. I can access that list from the app, so no more forgetting that I need something when I'm at the store. If my partner remembers something we need while I'm at the store, he can tell Alexa and it updates my list. I just check the list one last time before I check out. It seems like such a simple thing, but for me, it's been so useful.","Positive"
"1850","I'd still love to be able to change her name to something other than the three options, but that's such a trivial thing that I can't knock stars off.","Negative"
"1851","she loves me I love her....u got to get  one","Positive"
"1852","We love this thing.  Alexa is my husband's mistress and I love her too! Win, win.","Positive"
"1853","I ask her to do so much in my life, I feel like I can stop talking to anyone else. Home Automation, Jokes, Takeout Orders, and so much more.","Positive"
"1854","Seriously, What is there not to say about echo? Just wait until your WI-Fi goes out and you will realize how much of a daily part of your life she becomes!","Negative"
"1855","love it  its like having a personal secretary","Positive"
"1856","Love my echo. Hands free voice operated playlists on demand. And reading my kindle books a definite plus.","Positive"
"1857","could not get it to sync, returned it ,but didn't get all monies paid--although i could never get it to work....brand new. i talked 2 tech dept to no avail.....","Positive"
"1858","Effortless to use and nearly effortless to setup.  Fun device that continues to surprise me!","Positive"
"1859","Want to learn how to teach her more - very cool - looking for more apps that will engage conversation with her back and forth - Right now it is limited to a few apps.","Positive"
"1860","Need more interaction and it would be perfect!","Positive"
"1861","Great product!!!","Positive"
"1862","Love it","Positive"
"1863","Love it. Outstanding voice recognition","Positive"
"1864","This thing is a piece of garbage. First the Alexa app would not download and I needed to call customer service. After finally deleting and reloading the app THREE times, I got the app to load properly. Then the app would not enable the device to connect to my internet. Again I called customer service and they had me re-boot my computer, that didn't work. Then customer service wanted me to take a pin, yes a pin!!! and reboot the Alexa. At this point I wanted this $179.00 piece of junk out of my house. I urge anyone reading this, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY on this garbage. I spent two hours of my life on this garbage that I will never get back.","Negative"
"1865","I LOVE ALEXA! very useful while cooking and doing homework. Syncs right to your amazon account.","Positive"
"1866","Awesome......","Positive"
"1867","Fantastic never thought I'd enjoy it this much, refurbished was just as NEW as BRAND NEW PLASTIC and all.","Positive"
"1868","I really love my Echo when I can do the things I like.  One of those things is my shopping list.  However I can not get help on it.  I have been trying to get to Manage My Lists for 3 days.  I keep getting the same message, Sign in to Amazon Alexa App - Manage your lists - Alexa Shopping List.","Positive"
"1869","Actually way better than I thought it might be, these assistant devices are the future.  I saw this on Mr Robot season 2 and it looked like a fun toy that I could try out for a while. Well, it's become essential now. In the month I've had it I: set up a smart home setup with smart lights, removed my radio alarm clock using this instead, demoed it to 5 other people who went on to buy echo dots themselves, listen to way more music and radio than I did before. I bought a refurb one because I've had good luck with refurbs and I couldn't tell the difference if this was a new echo or not, i've never actually seen a brand new echo in all fairness. If you keep your questions to it simple enough it knows a lot of stuff, ""when was the french revolution?"" that kind of thing. It really is a good start to personal assistants.","Positive"
"1870","Things i like to do with it:","Positive"
"1871","Wake up with alarm","Negative"
"1872","Settle debates at work(bought a dot for work)","Positive"
"1873","Excelent !! I am happy controlling my  LUTRON home light system  using voice commands ....","Positive"
"1874","Great fun. Can be used alone, but is also a good gateway into home automation.  Very versatile and works well with a number of products made by various home automation system manufacturers.  I am currently using mine to control lighting, a main door lock, and an ecobee3 thermostat. If you are new to the Echo, I would suggest Googling it.  There are tons of reviews and YouTube videos out there about it.","Positive"
"1875","greatest thing Amazon has invented; use it everyday for music and current events and everything else...","Positive"
"1876","I received my Echo yesterday. I love it. I'm still exploring all it can do and am so far ecstatic with results. Thank you","Positive"
"1877","love this product -- every week i add new tasks","Positive"
"1878","Its OK... Not great..","Positive"
"1879","Unfortunately, they FORCE you to use BING.. which is a ridiculous excuse for a search engine.","Negative"
"1880","Who in their right mind would use BING for anything? Really?","Positive"
"1881","Lots of pretty simple questions it can't deal with. Works great if you want the weather forecast in your area.","Positive"
"1882","If there was freedom to use Google search, that would MAYBE raise the star rating..","Positive"
"1883"," - I recommend GOOGLE HOME. Alexa will just be an echo from the past..","Positive"
"1884","I have found so many uses for Amazon Echo. I also love the fact that she will play all of my music. Don't know how I got along without her (Alexis)!","Positive"
"1885","Returned, it seemed to work great initially. But after about a week or so with the Echo we had issues where Pandora would stop mid song after a minute or two and the only way to make it work again is to reboot the Echo.","Positive"
"1886","It's my belief that devices like the Echo, or other IoT devices should never really need to be rebooted for core functionality.","Positive"
"1887","There's a lot of promise there and if it just worked I'd be more than happy to own one.","Positive"
"1888","HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY-WORKS GREAT, AND IT WILL GET USED WONDERFULLY AND ALOT!!!  THANK YOU AMAZON VERY MUCH,KEEP ON KEEPING ON!!!","Positive"
"1889","The family is really having a lot of fun with this and the news feed in the morning is great.","Positive"
"1890","Its fine for simple things like flash news or weather.  Not worth the money as the music sound is weak in the lows, and mids.  Kids like to play with it and listen to childrens music to dance to.","Positive"
"1891","This is PERFECT! Way Better than Siri! It NEVER misunderstands like Siri! Weather, your everyday traffic report, play pandora, math, jokes, thermostat adjustments, timer, alarm and more. So easy to use!!!","Positive"
"1892","Works good but when music is playing you have to be right on top of it before it respones","Positive"
"1893","Has to be plugged in to operate, doesnt work without wifi and doesnt connect well to bluetooth plus it's expensive.","Positive"
"1894","Coolest thing since legalized Marijuana.","Positive"
"1895","The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because the echo dots are a fraction of the price and do exactly the same thing the only difference is that they don't have the 360 degrees speakers ... But you can hook your own speaker to the dots ... I know is not right since the dots came out earlier but since they are cheaper the dots are getting the 5 stars","Positive"
"1896","The apps not working so at that point all I can do is listen to music and set alarms. On top of that the echo not wireless. I could buy a wireless speaker for half the price and pretty much do the same thing. So without the app working the Echo is a way overpriced speaker that's not wireless","Positive"
"1897","love!","Positive"
"1898","After about 7 or 8 months the speaker/audio sporadically stops working until I power cycled Echo.  Pretty major inconvenience since that's Echo's main functionality.  I suppose it's not surprising to have a few duds with a new product line, but you always hope it's not you.","Positive"
"1899","That said, I hooked up my Hue Lights to echo and that works great (even without the speaker working).","Positive"
"1900","I have to scream at the unit before it will respond.  It's not making my life easier, it's making it more difficult.  I also bought an echo unit, hoping it would help.  I've read the user manuals and nothing seems to help.  If this is cutting edge, Cortana works better.  That being said, I am waiting for Amazon to provide some type of tech assistance in real time versus email to deal with this issue before I send both items back.","Negative"
"1901","I was a touch intimidated when I decided to try to make my home a little smarter and then being able to use Echo to be able to control everything by voice. I now have an Echo, Dot, Nest thermostat, and several Philips Hue lights set up. Things to try if you haven't- jeopardy, though you only get 6 questions a day. Rules for games (when the kids can't agree Alexa can settle the argument), ""good morning"", she'll let you know what's going on that day, flash briefing-customize it to your liking, you won't be disappointed, Akinator (sp?)- it may take more than 20 questions but she's probably going to get it right (even guessed Louise Belcher from Bob's Burgers correctly), weather, sports, conversions, and even recipes. I haven't even scratched the surface of potential. Worth it. The Dot is just as functional, the only real difference being sound quality.","Positive"
"1902","This has changed my life! I love the calendar feature and the every growing things I can do with it.","Positive"
"1903","Don't buy no matter what! It doesn't understand anything you say, it's like Siri but costs $100. For instance when you say ""repeat song"" she plays a totally different one, and you have to download everything you want her to do which takes up tons of space you could use for something much better like taking pictures with your family.","Positive"
"1904","Best purchase I have ever made!","Positive"
"1905","Performs as advertised and way beyond my expectations. It's simplicity is amazing for something that is so wildly useful to anyone wanting to turn their home into a smart house.","Positive"
"1906","Awesome works great and the whole family loves it!","Positive"
"1907","I love this unit but I am forced to give it less than perfect scores.  It has an amazing ability to hear it's name and respond.  It interacts with Amazon to play music flawlessly.  The unit has what seams to be intellegence but ask it to do something else and you need the manual.  It can send text messages but it requires a ""through"" phrase to porperly initiate the process.  I keep copies of these phrases on my phone to reference back the exact format.  The echo is a wonderful advance in technology.  Sound quality is good and it is a silent listener in your house.  This may be good or bad depending on your security concerns.","Positive"
"1908","Great birthday present!","Positive"
"1909","Update:  A new power cord was all that was needed, although there was nothing observably wrong with the original one.","Negative"
"1910","Love this thing!!!!","Positive"
"1911","Ok love it. great for everyday use around the house and the quality of the speakers are great. It is a continuing learning fun for both of us.","Positive"
"1912","Amazon Echo is the best","Positive"
"1913","I've been using Echo for a couple weeks now and it can do some pretty impressive things, however, now if you don't need the speaker output of the Echo the Dot does just about everything for $50 now.  By now if you've been researching it, you know all the big plus's but here are some of the minor things I'd like to see changed/updated.","Positive"
"1914","It's integration is good, I was able to set it up with IFTTT and control my Harmony remote, it works pretty well with Hue lights.  So it has no problem turning my entertainment system on or off, turning lights on an off, dimming them etc.  It plays Amazon music well, setup is pretty easy, and it does an amazing job of hearing your voice even with background noise, something my Dot does not do nearly as well.","Positive"
"1915","So onto the things I'd like to see it do better, or additional capabilities that other people looking to purchase one of these might want to know that I wish I knew up front.","Positive"
"1916","1) It does not interface well with iTunes, and cannot interact with your iTunes library in any convenient manner.  The only way you can get to your itunes music library is by pairing your phone.  You can do this with a few voice commands,  ""Alexa Connect"" will attempt to connect to your phone, it can go forward, backward etc. in your music but control is very limited, you cannot search for something in your library.  For example if I ask it to play something that Amazon offers in it's library and my itunes library, it will disconnect from the phone and play the Amazon version, meaning I have to reconnect the phone to get back to my music.  Not sure whose being stubborn on this one Apple or Amazon but it's not surprising they don't play well together.  Also the volume needs to be increased way up to play any connected bluetooth music source, once you are done then the volume on Alexa is way too high.  So if you use iTunes it's a pain, basically you might as well just control your music from the phone once connected.","Positive"
"1917","2) It cannot work ""with"" other DOT/Echo/etc. units to cover the whole house.  For example if you have a Dot upstairs and you set a timer on your Echo in the kitchen, the Dot upstairs will not alert you when that timer is done.  You also cannot use them to play music through the whole house.  This might be a trade off, for example you can play two different music sources at the same time, and sometimes you don't all the devices doing the same thing.  Perhaps they need a new keyword that allows all Alexa devices to operate as whole house for music, alarms, timers etc.","Positive"
"1918","3) You cannot use it as a ""That"" in IFTTT.  This is a huge disappointment.  It's easy to use IFTTT to set up a recipe where for example I say ""Alexa trigger TV off"" and Alexa will turn my entertainment system off using my Harmony remote.  However you cannot make Alexa say something based on a trigger.  For example it would be great if you could setup Alexa to notify you about events and say something like ""There's smoke in the basement"",  or ""There's a severe thunderstorm warning active for this area"",  ""It's 11pm and the garage door is still open"" etc. Alexa can initiate other things to happen, but it cannot alert you that something else has happened.","Positive"
"1919","Just a tip if you use the Hue lights, do not name your light bulbs and your rooms similar.  While it seems logical and it works fine in Hue, Alexa will have problems with this.  For example I had a bulbs called Kitchen 1, and Kitchen 2, and a room called Kitchen.  Alexa would get confused with this when I'd say something like ""Alexa Kitchen on 100%""  It thought I was trying to control Kitchen 1.","Positive"
"1920","All in all it's a pretty good device but if you don't need the speaker the Dot is probably a great and cheap way to see if you like using Alexa.  If you decide you do and buy the Echo, you aren't out anything because you'll want to put the Dot upstairs, downstairs etc. anyway.","Positive"
"1921","Amazing, period.","Positive"
"1922","What an incredible concept!","Positive"
"1923","I cant wait to add other features to my echo, to make my home a smart home","Positive"
"1924","We all love Alexa.","Positive"
"1925","I really like the Echo ... but as I can still remember the great flood, I'm having problems getting all it's functions working.  It's not the Echo.  Guess I'll have to wait on my grandkids to help. : )","Negative"
"1926","I like it enough but still lacking. I would move over to the whole Amazon ecosystem if it had better phone/tablet options but it doesn't so Alexa should be more open to connecting to other systems. I use IFTTT to connect Alexa but it's a hassle to me. And if you want Alexa to do different things, you have to enable the skill and then remember each skill by its unique name. Too difficult to remember each app name when I should be able to say, ""Alexa, do This."" That makes it less intuitive. She's not able to take on traffic news either. She can only tell you traffic details for preprogrammed routes. The details are limited.","Positive"
"1927","There are some great things about it though too. The music variety is pretty good if you're connected to Amazon music. Sound and range is good too. I also enjoy Alexa being able to read my kindle books. I recently connected Alexa to Philips Hue so now she can turn off my lights and gadgets.","Positive"
"1928","Still needs a lot of work to be better than Google Home.","Positive"
"1929","This device is absolutely fantastic.... Its everything you will need for entertainment and news in the house. I give my five stars unreservedly!","Positive"
"1930","Had her for over a year now and still in love. And surprise, we now have two Dots!  Still trying to figure out who the father is. Very sexy piece of technology.","Positive"
"1931","Amazon products keep getting better. This device is tip top awesome.","Positive"
"1932","Finding new uses for it all the time.  Works with other items such as the Nest thermostat and the Vinli OCR reader.  Very convenient to ask Alexa how much gas is in my truck.","Positive"
"1933","They seem to have a problem with the power adapter.  Mine quit working one day after I unplugged it and then plugged it back in to get the Echo rebooted.  Never came back on.  I went online and found that many people had encountered a similar problem.  No knowing whether it was the adapter or the Echo that had died I tried the online warranty claim with Amazon.  They wanted me to ship to their facility where they would check it out.  I inquired about the adapter problem that I had read about.  I was told that if the Echo tested out OK they would send me a voucher to purchase a new adapter.  Seemed like too much of a hassle.  I just purchased an alternative adapter from Amazon for $15.  Worked like a charm!  Cost me $15 that it shouldn't have but was better then shipping a unit back and forth and waiting for it all to happen.","Positive"
"1934","Plays the music I like, the news I want to hear, even works with IFTT to ring my phone when I don't know where I left it.  If it stops working, buy a new adapter.","Positive"
"1935","Do you amazing device to live without it","Positive"
"1936","We have two. Simply love her but, she has an attitude. Great fun and sound quality.","Positive"
"1937","I love my Echo!  I've had it for a few days now and have used it for a variety of things. The setup was easy and I did the voice training several times hoping it would help out with any misunderstandings. Alexa has a great speaker that sounds crisp & clear which is good since she replaced my old Bluetooth speaker. Alexa will tell you the time, measurements, mileage to a location.  She can set alarms & timers, play a variety of music, answer pretty much any question which you could look up online but quickly.  She can control your lights or other appliances. With certain apps she can play games and tell you account balances.  She sure does a lot and she can even tell you jokes!  She's been pretty useful these last few days and I'm really pleased with my purchase!","Positive"
"1938","The only 2 negatives I've found are...first, it would be nice to be able to have more options for naming Alexa, as my daughter has a similar name and this has already caused a bit of confusion in my house.","Positive"
"1939","The second thing and it's really not bad just wish that there were more useful apps or skills to add. When you go through some of the skills there are so many that are just ridiculous.  I don't know who creates all of these but more skills that involve things which can help make our lives more productive would be great instead of hamster humor........","Positive"
"1940","Overall, Alexa is pretty great and I will probably buy the dot for another room!","Positive"
"1941","4stars as there is some room for improvement with skills.","Positive"
"1942","This beautiful lady joined us earlier this week and we have had nothing but fun with her.  Well,  there was the time I wanted to see how loud she could sing and she got so loud she couldn't hear me telling her to lower it.  But all in all its been great ! She needed an outfit so I ordered this silky red number.  Her size?  Don't ask,  that is just rude . A wine bottle outfit fits her perfectly.  ~Elaine","Positive"
"1943","Awesome","Positive"
"1944","This Echo is awesome and everyone should have one!","Positive"
"1945","I have now spoiled myself.","Negative"
"1946","Now when I go over to a friends house, and try to turn off I light, I ask Alexa to do it. They just stare at me awkwardly.","Positive"
"1947","Well... It's hard to say. This product was sort of in the middle, but it was more on the bad side. Instead of this I could have bought a weather clock for 20 dollars. It can only reply to several questions. It can tell you the weather, or it can play just about any AM or FM radio station. The only catch is that it has to be phrased in only a certain way for it to understand you. If you ask it to set a timer or an alarm, it will, but most of the time it gets the wrong time. If you ask the time, it will tell you. We recently got a dog. The name was somewhat close to ""Alexa"", the default name for the echo. We weren't so surprised when it started waking up every time we said the dog's name. We changed the name to ""Echo"", but then it woke up to both ""Echo"" and the dog's name. We changed it to the only other name available, but no matter what, it woke up to anything. It's too late to return it, but I definitely wouldn't recommend anyone to buy it.","Positive"
"1948","Absolutely love it","Positive"
"1949","Fun for whole family. Great for when you are cooking and can't touch your devices","Positive"
"1950","What can I say it drives me crazy sometimes but I love it.","Negative"
"1951","love it","Positive"
"1952","Echo does not seem to play more than one movement of a classical music work.  E.G. with a three movement symphony you get just the first.  This is strange because Echo will play an entire pop music album.  Please fix it.  This is the case even if one pays for the Prime music service.","Positive"
"1953","I adore this Echo along with my Tap.  Each of them allow me calm my little one with soothing music whether I am in the living room and we want to jam with the speaker boosted Echo or if I want the lower volume Tap.  I also adore the ability to create my shopping list vocally without having to search the house for pen and paper.","Positive"
"1954","Works as advertised.","Positive"
"1955","I love using my Alexa it really helps me in the morning to get ready for work and to do fun things with it . Amazon thanks for being the best ever <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0099><U+0082><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D>","Positive"
"1956","The only reason that I do not give the Echo 5 stars, is that it does not allow me to vocally send texts or make calls while connected via bluetooth to my phone. I feel like this is really basic, and it is quite unreasonable that this is not a feature considering some of the other not nearly as useful features the Echo offers.","Positive"
"1957","Like it but after a few months it stopped working because it was defective.  Amazon sent new one but did not include a power adapter (i sent mine back with the defective one) so its useless.Looks like it doesn't come with a power adapter and you have to buy that separately now.What kind of idiota sells an electric device without including the required power cord?","Positive"
"1958","I'm a huge music lover I love this I added Amazon music unlimited and now there is nothing I can't listen to. Amazing product Amazon!!!!!","Positive"
"1959","I use Echo daily to check weather, traffic, my daily schedule, shopping and to do list.  Being 72 and living alone, my daughter has encouraged me to get one of those alert devices.  I was able to set up emergency alerts to family members, should the need arise, at no additional cost!  I love that I can ask for music, a joke or to play a game.  With Christmas coming,  this would be a wonderful family gift!","Positive"
"1960","A great roommate - speaks only when spoken to.  Seinfeld trivia is great.","Positive"
"1961","My daughter love it","Positive"
"1962","the Echo itself is great. Setup was a breeze. However, I recently ordered the Echo Dot and after 3 hours have given up trying to get it to work. I did briefly hear Alexa's voice on the Dot, though, and it is thin, sharp, and unpleasant compared the the original full sized Echo. The bottom line based on my experience. The Echo is great. The Echo Dot is useless. I'm returning mine.","Positive"
"1963","nice addition to our home.","Positive"
"1964","Also please note, I am writing my review of the Echo Dot here because the ability to write reviews of the Dot appear to have been disabled by Amazon.","Negative"
"1965","The echo is pretty great for what it is supposed to do. I've eliminated the cheap, tacky alarm clock that I had on my nightstand and replaced it with my echo. Although I do plan to purchase the Dot and move the larger device into the main living area.","Negative"
"1966","Some negatives:","Negative"
"1967","As many reviews have stated, the speaker does sound a bit crappy when cranked all the way up, especially if you listen to songs with lots of bass. This just was not a deal breaker for me.","Positive"
"1968","It does have to be plugged in at all times, which may bother some users, but I think the Dot is the fix for that, plus they have portable chargers now.","Negative"
"1969","What's most disappointing about the echo in my opinion, is that when you ask a question, Google isn't the search engine used. I doubt this will come in a future update since the company is rolling out their own device. Bummer.","Negative"
"1970","I can check my commute before I head to work, control my thermostat, play all of my Amazon music playlists, and numerous other things. My kids also enjoy when Alexa tells them a joke.","Positive"
"1971","It's just an all-around great device.","Positive"
"1972","so useful, never used voice control before alexa, and it was such a good price!!! 10/10 would recommend","Positive"
"1973","Love it.","Positive"
"1974","We love this thing. I would go into detail about how awesome it, and Alexa, are but this has been highlighted numerous times.","Positive"
"1975","Get it, you will be in for a surprise!","Positive"
"1976","Love, love, love my Alexia.","Positive"
"1977","So easy to use. Amazing how well it hears from across the room  even when playing music.","Positive"
"1978","exceeded my expectations","Positive"
"1979","Love it!  I've had a lot of fun with the Echo!  It helps out a lot around my house!","Positive"
"1980","I was unprepared how utterly useless alexa would be.  She cannot search by audio such as Shazam.  Songs that aren't in spotify she simply says ""I cannot find that song in your library.""  Many times alexa will just play something after not finding a song ""you might like this song instead.""  No!  I want you to do nothing instead alexa!  I was expecting a Siri like experience and alexa is anything but.  Design and quality are superior however the echo is really lacking in the software department.  The echo has been out well over a year and it seems more of a beta.  Come on amazon, the echo needs support!","Positive"
"1981","Needs some improvements but overall it's a good start to hands free living","Positive"
"1982","love this product","Positive"
"1983","It has a lot of good information, but it seems that there are a lot of things that it doesn't understand. Some information seems limited.","Positive"
"1984","I bought one for my sisiter.  She told her friend Alexia is NOT a ""morning girl"" =","Positive"
"1985","Jokes could be better.","Positive"
"1986","We simply love our Alexa!  Fantastic music player, can ask it anything. It has a prominent place in our living room. Everyone thinks its super cool.","Positive"
"1987","Love this thing.  Had a few glitches trying to set it up but there are YouTube videos out there that helped and with a little struggle I got it up and running.  I use it mainly for simple things such as listening to radio, streaming music, telling time, and weather but you get addicted to having it for those things. As an aside the selection on Prime music is surprisingly good.","Positive"
"1988","I can't read and wright very well.","Positive"
"1989","Nice item.","Positive"
"1990","Would have given the Echo three and a half stars if I could.  It is a good effort and has promise.  Voice recognition is a very difficult thing to program and understanding accurate context can be even more difficult.  I expect that Amazon will continue to improve the product in this regard.  My biggest complaint is its lack of ability to connect to and interact with my iPhone calendar, contacts, etc.  Given the large number of Apple product owners this is a surprisingly large gap in capabilities.  It is hoped that Amazon and Apple will push to quickly resolve this limitation.","Positive"
"1991","Absolutely an amazing piece of technology.  I can listen to songs, get directions, forecast, etc all with a voice.","Positive"
"1992","Not a toy, but a full fledged instant access to any song I can name and some I can't.  New look-ups being added makes Alexa(our name) more fun all the time.  The sound portion of Echo is excellent and brings music, news and info. to areas of our house we have not been able to access with ordinary bulky equipment.","Positive"
"1993","Keep up all the new features.  We love it and so do our friends and family.","Positive"
"1994","She does not respond in the morning.  You have to hit the top buttom (or something)","Positive"
"1995","alexa is my new girlfriend ////////I LOVE HEAR","Positive"
"1996","So so understanding. Glitchy interactive. Sometimes seems locked in a loop and need to wait hours for it to reset.","Negative"
"1997","We love ours !!!","Positive"
"1998","Honestly, this is a high price for music. Yes, she does math and the alarm is a good feature. However, I ask for the weather and get another city, you ask questions and get ""Hmmm...I can't understand the question"". I get that a lot. Google is a better choice and it is free. Don't pay the exorbitant price for a radio.","Positive"
"1999","Amazon echo,all I do now is tell Alexa what to do.Sound quality is awesome,you ask and she tells you.","Positive"
"2000","Love it!  Getting use to having Alexa around to answer my questions but I see using her even more in the future.","Positive"
"2001","Wow. Love my echo!","Positive"
"2002","This little gym is awesome! I use it daily, and enjoy the company.","Positive"
"2003","Setup was very easy and works great with the other devices (ecobee thermostat and WEMO Switch)","Positive"
"2004","Her friend said she had the same challenge.  However, they both still like Alexia.","Positive"
"2005","Love it! My own personal assitant and a nice brain for the house automation.","Positive"
"2006","We got our Echo in Dec 2015.  It failed a few days short of its first birthday and Amazon cross shipped a replacement.  We have enjoyed playing with Alexia and using the Echo as a music player.  But a few days ago it started playing a very energetic march at very high volume.  pressing the control buttons on top made the light change color but didn't stop it.  ""Alexia stop"" or ""Alexia quiet"" didn't stop it, either.  The remote control had no effect, either.  Unplugging it worked, of course.  That does it as far as we're concerned.  Just too wierded out!","Positive"
"2007","Thought Alexa would answer more questions, similar to Siri...i like Siri's abilities a lot better.","Positive"
"2008","I LOVE my Amazon Echo. I bought one for our house, then bought them as gifts for two family members. In addition, I purchased a first generation Echo Dot for my bedroom. When I saw the new Echo Dot, I ordered one of those to replace the one in my bedroom. I was very excited because I was going to bring my first generation Dot to use in my classroom. Today, I tried to set up the Dot at school and was saddened to discover that I cannot set it up on our network because it does not support WPA2 Enterprise. I did some searching online and found that many people are not able to use their Echos at their work locations for the same reason. I love this product so much and would think that Amazon would encourage customers to purchase these for work and home locations. It would be GREAT to use in the classroom. Please fix this, Amazon!","Positive"
"2009","I love the Echo but being an older person and not use to all the tech realities, I wish more info was put out in it's selling details explaining you would need a smart phone or a computer headed nephew that could get it going for you.In my opinion,a nice product but not user friendly for most of us older folks. Also the yearly discount they offered at approximately $3.99 a month could not be applied for some reason. I had to go with the yearly fee of $99.99.To me this was a bit of false advertising","Positive"
"2010","Alexa is great to have around.  I highly recommend an Echo, or an Echo Dot.","Positive"
"2011","good one","Positive"
"2012","Working from home, this has become an indispensable part of my life and I am only scratching the surface of all that ECHO can do.  The sound of the music is excellent and being able to access the Amazon library for music leaves me unlimited choices.  I also like to play the NPR news along with weather.  As time goes on, I am sure that I will find many other uses for this device.  It is hard to believe that this sounds as good as my old 1970s stereo used to.  Love it.","Positive"
"2013","So easy to use. Sound exceeds expectations.","Positive"
"2014","Love it. Bought a second for my daughter's room.","Positive"
"2015","I like the option of getting the dot.","Positive"
"2016","Shhh. I hear this is coming to Canada. I couldn't wait and have mine up and running in the True North. This is the best. My kids (adults) laughed when I started turning on lights and asking Alexa questions. Now they all want one.","Negative"
"2017","I have ordered the dot and will order more. This is the best smart product I have found.","Positive"
"2018","What can I say... Alexa is a part of our family...","Positive"
"2019","We purchased this for my 90 year old unlce who loves it. Set up.took me 15 minutes, but now he asks her jokes, plays music, news, weather etc...","Positive"
"2020","Got my echo dot 2nd generation today, all 6 of them.  None works.  My 1st gen Echo is still works well; however, none of the new echo dot 2nd generation works.  I got the setup up to the point my iPhone connected to the echo dot.  Then, the setup just error out with the error code 558170320.  I thought I got one bad device; then I tried another and then another and none of them works.","Positive"
"2021","LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! MY Echo! Will be buying more. Makes everything from listening to music, setting timers and asking for measurement conversions while cooking....so simple and enjoyable. I have not tried ordering things on Amazon with my Echo. Yet.","Positive"
"2022","I live in Jamaica and wanted to be able to enjoy the Amazon Echo experience.  I actually ordered one only find out that this device does not work in my country.  As a loyal and frequent customer of Amazon I was extremely disappointed that you don't seem to value your customers outside of the US. I'm so very disappointed. Now I'll have to wait and see what Google Home does for it's overseas customers.","Positive"
"2023","I cannot live without my echo. It would be nice to be able to connect other music sources","Positive"
"2024","I will be buying alexia a soon as i have time to figure her out.","Positive"
"2025","Works just as described.","Positive"
"2026","Echo is cool product and does the basics pretty well. It can quickly answer questions about weather, traffic and even order an Uber for you. The main detractor I have is that it is not very conversational. If there are different smart lights you want Alexa to turn on I have to issue the request one after the other. It would be really nice to say ""Alexa turn on the Hallway and bedroom lights. Hopefully this will be one of the updates that rolls out in the future. I also wish Alexa had a larger database to answer questions...I expect this to be fixed with time.","Positive"
"2027","Owned this hunk of junk for just over one year and it went dead.  What a hunk of junk.","Negative"
"2028","Very well made but needs a battery to move around","Positive"
"2029","It sucks","Negative"
"2030","Echo has many uses and it constantly improves with new things that it can do.  Weather, music, traffic, information and many more things that it can do.","Positive"
"2031","I got this as a gift from a friend for my birthday and honestly I can say it may be the best gift EVER!  I would have never gotten it for myself, now I am browsing all the possible accessories.... Who knew I need it so badly?  Love the phone answering capabilities, ordering something from amazon, reading a book, playing music, finding recipes and adding to my grocery list!  I am just figuring out all it can do.  Kids fight over who gets to select music... don't forget to ask her to tell a joke.... The sound quality is amazing!  Amazon prime music is awesome!","Positive"
"2032","If I have one complaint it is that the hub of the house is the kitchen, the best use for me is in the kitchen.  Although it is a tower and doesn't take up that much space, every bit of counter space is valuable and in my kitchen all counters are possible danger zones.  I am waiting for Alexa to get smashed or saturated and keep trying to find her a safe spot.  I wish this could mount to a wall or hang from underneath cabinet.","Positive"
"2033","Helps to keep grocery list,set timers,listen to music,and entertains the kids. Very cool","Positive"
"2034","Luv it!  Streaming music by request, audiobooks, shopping list. Wow!","Positive"
"2035","i hear alexia is great when you are a amazon prime member, for ordering stuff. I am an ""Amazon Primer""!","Positive"
"2036","Alexa, write a review.  My son loves playing different kinds of music.  I love the fact that I can lock him out of changing the station.","Positive"
"2037","I love the echo. My husband had one and I decided I wanted one for my sons room because he loves to ask questions. It's a great product and can't wait to add the light add ons. I've had no issues with speech recognition at all. Worth every dime","Positive"
"2038","You have to say ""ALEXA"" before every single command.  It get old pretty quick.  Amazon, you need to make controling devices more fluent.","Positive"
"2039","I love the Amazon Echo! I can see so much potential for it! I just wish Amazon supported more functionality natively.","Positive"
"2040","Amazing! The family loves it!","Positive"
"2041","It was given to a neighbor as a gift. She loves it.","Positive"
"2042","Echo masked it so easy to do so many  tasks. Any music I want to hear with quality speakers, easy set up, to do lists for appointments, grocery list, weather etc. Love it, love it.","Positive"
"2043","Yes and then some, my son bought one before he moved out and my wife like it so much that I bought her one ! Very good sound it sits on our island and sound great !","Positive"
"2044","Amazing product. Still waiting for Alexa's AI to kick in and learn faster. Love the speaker... has a good range and deep bass.","Positive"
"2045","VERY SMART","Positive"
"2046","Easy to set up, works great, a lot of fun and useful","Positive"
"2047","I had been considering getting the Amazon Echo for a while. I had done my research on it, seeing what kind of features it had and what people were saying about it. I finally made the decision to buy it. I have to say that I am very pleased with it so far, I have only had it two days now. Alexa is 10x better that Siri. She is all around awesome. The speaker inside is great, way better than any other I have ever used. I don't remember seeing this in the description, but I found out that you can connect your phone and play your own music. I would definitely buy this again and would recommend this to anyone.","Positive"
"2048","One of the best produce we have gotten from Amazon.  Love it, everyone should get one.","Positive"
"2049","It is awesome","Positive"
"2050","Very convenient. Would have gotten five stars, but it's not as intuitive as Siri. An improved operating site would bring it from good to great.","Positive"
"2051","I was terribly disappointed by Alexa and her capabilities.  To begin with, I am an IPhone user so Siri, although deaf at times, has 1000% more capabilities than Alexa.  I figured most of the reviews I read before came from people who have not met Siri.","Negative"
"2052","I opened the package anxiously when it arrived.  Setting it up was more complicated than it needed to be.  I was unable to set up the Wifi, and since I was eager to use it, I set it up via Bluetooth.","Negative"
"2053","- Alexa, play music.  - I figured she could find 1 song in the universe to play back for me and up ease me.","Positive"
"2054","-You don't have the service setup  - I think she said, denying my request.","Negative"
"2055","At this point, I realized any command I could give Alexa is a command Siri already responds to.","Positive"
"2056","Snooze, set alarm, play my music, add a reminder, add a note, add an appointment, weather,... you name it!","Positive"
"2057","Even though Siri and I don't see eye to eye on sometimes, I like her much better than Alexa.  She is more versatile and useful than Alexa.","Positive"
"2058","Love it.","Positive"
"2059","Besides, I don't need to be ordering stuff via a speaker.","Positive"
"2060","she s a hit in our home...husband loves her ...she doesn't talk back when asked a question...lol..","Positive"
"2061","I'm still learning the ins and outs, but this is a very handy little helper.","Positive"
"2062","Love Alexa","Positive"
"2063","Love Alexa and will be glad when she learns new skills that meet my needs","Positive"
"2064","Good product as described.","Positive"
"2065","This is the first time I've done a review and is to point a finger at Amazon. I like the Echo but have come up against a wall. After talking to their not to sharp people with (strangely) Indian accents that's difficult to understand. The problem is the blue tooth on the Echo only works with portable devices and not surround sound system receivers like the Sony STR-DH750 that has blue tooth capacity. The sound is OK on the Echo but come on Jeff (CEO) you think no one would want to use your Prime Music without voice commands GEEZ!!!! I feel like I've being scammed by the people doing the bad impersonations of the IRS calling from India...","Positive"
"2066","Love it.  Love it.","Positive"
"2067","It doesn't work In Brasil","Positive"
"2068","I like the Amazon Echo but we don't use it as much as thought we would. If we had any integrated wi-fi devices it would be better. Unfortunately the cost of wi-fi compatible controllers for your thermostat, door locks, lighting, etc. are still too expense to be practical. We need to learn how to use it better. I would like to set it to come on at a certain time with a news update or music to wake by but I don't know if it is possible. It was easy to setup and use and it arrived when promised.","Positive"
"2069","Love the echo comes in so handy in the morning.","Positive"
"2070","Nothing short of bitchin...........","Negative"
"2071","Gift for granddaughter and she is thrilled.","Positive"
"2072","I'm addicted to my Echo. The family loves Alexa and we talk to her every day. We're just looking forward to the A.I. getting a little smarter and understanding more obscure questions. For now we hear a lot of ""I don't know how to answer your question"" replies.","Positive"
"2073","Echo is always improving.  Many times ""Alexa"" says ""I didn't understand your request"", but she's getting better.  The best use, for me, is being able to listen to an Audible book or my favorite music.  I get the weather and news headlines without having to turn on my TV and be bombarded by commercials. I'm sure I could use the Echo for more and will keep trying. Eventually I'll get the Smart Home products for lights and locks and thermostat for Alexa to control. I order things from Amazon, too, which is really convenient.  Can't wait to see more improvements, then I'll give a 5 star rating!","Positive"
"2074","What can I say?  We LOVE our","Positive"
"2075","I bought this product to help streamline our family calendar and help me with our shopping list.  Not only has it transformed both of these items in our family's life, but Alexa is a favorite in our household for music, homework questions from kids, traffic information for my husband's commute, and we even use it for our TV to find out what's coming up to watch!","Positive"
"2076","Ever changing, one day she will play  music, the next says none available...","Positive"
"2077","Alexa is amazing  does so much","Positive"
"2078","Really cool","Positive"
"2079","It doesn't take much time for ""Alexa"" to recognize your voice. Every morning I wake up to Flash News!  AND it responds to you even when you're in another room!  This is a great toy.","Positive"
"2080","My husband bought as a birthday gift and I must say I believe it to be very expensive since it is not even portable- I can't believe in this day and age this is not wireless.  I was sure I could carry it around room to room without plugging it in.  But  no it always needs to be plugged in- wow that makes this a $175 paper weight- also after being plugged in all night needed to reboot to speak to us again. If  you have an iPhone with SIRI and a cheap wireless speaker you are probably better off","Positive"
"2081","I'm liking Alexa more than I thought I would.  A friend of mine has been raving about Alexa and for the longest time I couldn't figure out why I'd have one.  I like gadgets, but this is quite an expensive one if you don't know how you'll use it.  I have several laptops, tablets, smart phones...did I really need Alexa?  In fact I did and I do and here's why:","Positive"
"2082","Pros:","Positive"
"2083","- My kids can ask Alexa how to spell words.  Granted, sometimes she mishears words.  But about 98% of the time, she gets it right.  ""Mom, how do I spell 'castle'?"" Ask Alexa!","Positive"
"2084","- She can play music from Prime stations, Prime music and your music library.  This is actually so nice, because right when my hands are full of whatever I'm making for dinner, it's great to say ""Alexa, play some 80's music""","Positive"
"2085","- She has a pleasant voice and speaks fluently","Positive"
"2086","Has been working fine for about 2 months. Now it never responds to ""Alexa"" unless it's unplugged and reset. Not sure what happened to it, but it just doesn't work anymore.","Positive"
"2087","- She has good sense of humor programmed in.  My kid asked her to self-destruct and she answered ""Commencing self-destruct sequence. 5 4 3 2 1 BOOM.  Well, that didn't go as planned.""","Positive"
"2088","- She can read books from Audible or books from Amazon prime that are enabled for narration.  The Audible books are read in the original voice and the Amazon prime books, she reads in her voice - a bit monotonous, but not bad when you're tired of reading yet another Minecraft novel to your kids.","Negative"
"2089","- SKILLS!  There are lots of skills you can enable through the Alexa app - like the ability to translate to Spanish...it's not perfect, but it's a good start","Positive"
"2090","Just now my kids were asking her if she has hands, and she answered that she has no body.  Ask her if she has babies, and she says she doesn't have a family but has friends.  Ask her who her friends are and she says lots of people talk to her.  And the best, she knows the 3 rules of robots!","Positive"
"2091","Cons:","Negative"
"2092","I was raving about this thing until I asked Alexa to Play Candle In the Wind by Ed Sheeran a song I hadn't heard until ALEXA PLAYED IT.  I was able to ask her to play the song a few times after she initially played it, so my friends could hear it successfully but a few nights ago she said she couldn't find the song.  What!? very annoying I'm considering returning it.  Never heard of the song before I bought this thing now I'm annoyed she won't play it.  Am I going to like other songs she plays then arbitrarily ""can't find""? Took my excitement for this item away pretty much.  I only wanted it for music although the alarm, timer, news, weather, and asking her to tell me a joke was fun its something I personally could live without.  Jury is still out on this one and I'm still within the 30 day return window I think....","Positive"
"2093"," - yes, there are some cons...most important one is that she won't connect to my Instant Pot Smart and cook my supper!","Positive"
"2094"," - is she eavesdropping?  that's a question I've been asking myself more and more lately.  After all, it's a device that's always on just waiting to hear her name...sometimes in the middle of a conversation (and not with her), she says ""Sorry, I don't know how to help you with that"".  There is a button on top to turn off the microphone.  I've started using that more and more but does that really work?  I know she records commands to her...but does she record anything else?  Big brother or big sister?  I guess we give up privacy for convenience?","Positive"
"2095"," - Connect to Overdrive!  Yes, you can play Overdrive audio books (and if you don't know what Overdrive is, it's an app/site for managing library ebooks or audiobooks - meaning free if your library supports Overdrive and has an ebook/audiobook collection) on Alexa, but she is then just functioning as just a bluetooth speaker.  you can't tell her to read a certain book and you need to involve another device.","Positive"
"2096","- Connect to the Instant Pot Smart.  Yes, I also mentioned this as a con in jest.  If you don't know what an Instant Pot is, it's an electric pressure cooker and the Smart model comes with bluetooth.  I want to be able to control it via Alexa.","Positive"
"2097","- She should be able to do more AI.  When she's confused, she typically says ""Hmm.  I don't know how to help you with that"" or ""I don't understand your question"".  You should be able to tell her a more Alexa style command then so she can associate the 2 ways of saying something","Negative"
"2098","- I can only control one to do list and one shopping list.  I use Google Keep for my lists and Outlook for my calendar.  And my husband and I share a google account in addition, so that we can keep joint lists in Keep.  She should be able to interface with that.  I think this is a major handicap.  I realize Amazon wants you to use everything Amazon...but this is why PC's became better than Apple computers.  You can't be an isolationist.  People don't want to switch over all their apps to Amazon supported ones.","Positive"
"2099","- Amazon has my profile (who's in my family).  Every person in my family, except the 2 year old, has a Fitbit and yet Alexa can only tell me the status of mine as she's connected to my account.","Positive"
"2100","- I should be able to create a to-do list for my husband.  This is a major flaw.  If my husband is on my Amazon family profile, I need to be able to create items for him.  As in, ""Alexa, put fix faucet on my husband's to-do list."" Seriously, this is supposed to be be a family gadget, so why can I only create one to-do list?  Very primitive.","Positive"
"2101","- The Alexa app is a pain to use in the store to actually use my shopping list.  There are 3 or 4 steps to get into it.  Google Keep is much better. I enjoy being able to tell her what to add, but then retrieving that data isn't convenient.","Positive"
"2102","I love it.  I had been missing my vinyl collection but now I can listen to all those old albums again!!","Positive"
"2103","- She needs to get an urban dictionary! Or the ability to use other dictionaries - like one for Minecraft.  For when my kid wants to know how to spell ""Herobrine"".","Positive"
"2104","- I wish there was a way to get her to recognize my voice so that she woudn't do my kids' homework.  Why bother figuring out long division if you can just say ""Alexa, what is 48,234 divided by 343?""","Negative"
"2105","- I wish you could tell her to look something up ""Alexa, google how to craft a diamond sword in Minecraft""","Positive"
"2106","- I get the urge to talk to Alexa via my phone in the store...""Alexa, show me my shopping list"" and then realize, ""woe is me...Alexa isn't with me""","Negative"
"2107","What I'm really excited about:","Positive"
"2108","- SKILLS - yes, I mentioned this before.  But I'm not only excited about skills that other people create.  I'm excited about skills I can create.  I'm a software developer, so I'm excited about developing something that I can use on Alexa.","Positive"
"2109","So far so good! Alexa is my new Assistant! Love her!","Positive"
"2110","Used primarily for background music, the sound is great. I have 6 dots on the way!!!! Highly recommend this wonderful piece of technology.","Positive"
"2111","The Amazon Echo was a birthday gift from my husband and son tonight. It's only taken a few minutes to get it plugged in. Their really isn't any set up to speak of. Once plugged in and placed onto a flat surface you only need to know to say "" Alexa"" and the task you want to do. This is super easy! Ask her to read the books you've got on Kindle or Audible. Find the perfect raido station online, set your wake up alarm, Get your news or sport report and plenty of additional tasks are withen Alex's reach.","Positive"
"2112","Alexa is great","Positive"
"2113","Great device - easy to use!","Positive"
"2114","Love it! Several friends have one and we have a special Alexa Group/Texts every Saturday!!","Positive"
"2115","I knocked Alexa off a table and broke it. I was disappointed to find out that there is no repair or parts available so I was forced to replace it. I chose this refurbished model to save a few dollars. Working well so far. I'm feeling good about the refurbish choice. I don't think we will not have this entertaining AI at our house even though we don't use all the control features.","Positive"
"2116","Love what this can respond to and how quickly echo finds an answer","Positive"
"2117","Love the echo!","Positive"
"2118","I love it is all I cam say music sounds awesome coming out","Positive"
"2119","Love my Alexa!  Great to have for lists, music, smart home electronics and more!  Not sure what I did without it before!","Positive"
"2120","Love it","Positive"
"2121","Not much usage. Good for radio and news but otherwise waste of money","Negative"
"2122","Love how easy and intuitive this device is. Great voice recognition, plays any news, any music, stops immediately. Great speaker too.","Positive"
"2123","I think the Echo is a good product and can help a lot around the house for many people. The reason I gave it 3 stars is the commercials are very misleading. If you watch them they act as if you plug it into the wall and your whole house is magically voice controlled in minutes. The truth is you really need to hire an electrician to change a ton of outlets, mess with the electrical panel, replace almost all your bulbs, and buy about $600 worth of accessories to make it do all the at fun stuff. After all of that is done, it will take a few hours of programming your wink/alexa to your phone and putting in the product codes for each product you want connected. Once all that is done then yes it's pretty cool.","Positive"
"2124","Can't make changes because it is not compatible with windows 10 PC.","Positive"
"2125","  If you are busy guy and own a business like I do, this whole process can take a week or more to get it working fine. Keep that in mind before you buy one. If I could do it all over again, I would have just bought a nest thermostat and got off my lazy ass when I need to turn off some lights. :)","Positive"
"2126","Great buy, love having answers to my questions or music just by asking. Although she definately has a personality. It's almost like she is becoming sentient which is scary and cool af all at the same time.","Positive"
"2127","absolutely love this! We're not a super tech oriented family but we wanted something with good sound quality and the ability to function well with our family. We home school and this has lots of educational features we love to use. As an fyi when you change it to a wake word other than alexa it doesn't respond well. We tried using echo and it wasn't as responsive. Other than that it's easy to use! Our three kids enjoy it as much as we do.","Positive"
"2128","I love Alexa, this device does everything, I get my weather, my music and answers to questions I don't know.","Positive"
"2129","I'd definitely recommend it. Well worth the money.","Positive"
"2130","such a cool device","Positive"
"2131","Amazing...love Alexa so far...can't wait to start integrating her into our home. Also purchased 2 of the echo dots for the kids room, not sure how exactly they will all work together so I will have to watch some of the videos on them.","Positive"
"2132","I think this will be a great product in the near future, but now, it is so limiting and incorrect, we returned it.  We asked for a weather report for our location and the response was ""sunny and 95 degrees"".  Our local weather and our weather radar were both warning us about major thunderstorms on the way.  Another disappointing question we asked was to name the football team our team was playing that day and the only response we could get was the schedule for the following week.  I will say it has great speakers but limited in the music you can connect for now.  I expect that to expand.  We bought too early.  We will take another look at it in about a year.","Positive"
"2133","Works great, I find it very useful and playing music sounds great.","Positive"
"2134","Don't know how to give a negative star to Echo and Amazon.  Had since October 2016, went out of warranty in December, now won't work with router it's been on for last couple of months.  Tried all of the so called fixes, rebooted all connections, restored to factory, rebooted all connections, pressed for 5 seconds, then tried again to reconnect, finds modem then hangs until it times out.  Tried several time (probably 10 or more) to do all over again.  Still doesn't work.  Sucks to be me.  We have been using amazon for years, now I have to eat $195.  Guess I'll have to find another way to purchase online.","Positive"
"2135","Love it","Positive"
"2136","The echo is perfect! I love it!!!!","Positive"
"2137","Not impressed, should have saved money and will be going with google. I am not a die hard techie although my husband is. I also do not concentrate on the ""specs"" but rather the functionality. Having to download ""skills"" is annoying. I can't just ask Alexa whatever...she responds with her ever popular..."" I am sorry I didn't understand your question"" . Maybe I am used to Siri on the iPad or Ok google on the phone...don't know. Neither of us really like Alexa and maybe as a stater she's okay but way too much room for improvement.","Positive"
"2138","Got for a friend for christmas they loved it.","Positive"
"2139","Bought it for Alexa, didn't realize it was a bluetooth speaker!!!","Positive"
"2140","Awesome product.  Can't wait to start interfacing home automation.","Negative"
"2141","This gets used every day, new improvements weekly, we love it.","Positive"
"2142","Best investment I have made!","Positive"
"2143","Alexa learns more and more each day. I look in the app and add skills. Some of them put a smile on my face. I'm excited that amazon now added my skills. So now I can see what skills my Alexa has instead of trying to remember what I've added and what key words to speak. Thank you Amazon","Positive"
"2144","Please expand utility, like personalized timers and scheduled alerts.","Positive"
"2145","Good product and great sound from a small unit.","Positive"
"2146","The voice recognition profiles are excellent. However, the functionality is rather rigid. There needs to be lots more work for it to be a fully dynamic piece of my smart home.","Positive"
"2147","This is something that we actually didn't need, but are extremely happy we got it xD","Positive"
"2148","Besides music, we actually use it very often for anything really, from morning commute to kitchen timer, where everyone at home actually can hear and whoever is the nearest can go check the oven or something. Voice recognition is very accurate, until you're watching TV and it activates itself because some character's name happens to be Alexa or when they say ""Alex is a..."" haha it scared us once while we're watching TV late at night :D","Positive"
"2149","It works OK some of the times. other times I have to yell at it as if it was a little kid. The value of eight or nine it cannot hear me,  I have to manually go up to it and turn it down or even at a  lower level I have to talk very loud,  to it I've tried talking to it while in another room it will not respond. It does not work while the water is running not sure what version they are using in the advertising but mines does not work this way  is my second unit still needs.  Doesn't work you can ask at the weather and it works with no problem same for sports updates and for Pandora music that's when it's working 2 1/2 star a minimum","Positive"
"2150","I love the echo. We use it everyday and it was really simple to set up. The voice recognition is great quality. Tons of songs and play list with amazon prime. Can't beat it.","Positive"
"2151","Such an awesome piece of kit.  Combine it with some Hue lightbulbs and some smart switches and you have a really cool home automation hub.","Positive"
"2152","Voice recognition is by far the best of any. It even understands my 6 year old.","Positive"
"2153","Great home automation. Rare delivered 1 day late.","Positive"
"2154","I love it! It's perfect in my kitchen.","Positive"
"2155","Had this for year and a half,have never been able to connect it whenever I want some frustration I'll give it a try.Called customer service their pretty useless.Keep getting err registering message any ideas would be appreciated.I'd return it but it's a little to late!","Positive"
"2156","I absolutely love my Alexa.  It was easier trainer her than my boyfriend.  LOL","Positive"
"2157","I have no idea how I have lived so long without Alexa in my life! You will not regret buying her!","Negative"
"2158","I ordered Echo specifically for music - I've had a huge music library on Amazon for years. But it didn't take long after installing Echo to find out that there is now an annual charge for having over 250 songs, so only a small portion of my library is available. But OK - since subscription is to be expected these days, I decided to pare down my library down to fit and get Echo to play only the songs that are free.","Positive"
"2159","But I found Alexa will not play them. When I ask to play something from my music library, it plays unfamiliar songs that I know are not in there. If I ask for one of my playlists instead, more often than not she'll just start playing crappy Prime music.","Negative"
"2160","When that happens, I just keep saying ""Alexa, next"" until maybe 7 tunes later, it produces something I can actually tolerate. Another 7 or so crappy tunes, and my blood pressure is rising, so I figure it's too much work to listen to any more music on Echo. I say ""Alexa, stop.""","Negative"
"2161","When I ask for a specific song, I might get it to play because it's actually in Prime (I've been a Prime shipping member since the beginning). But more often, I will get a pitch for the ""Unlimited"" music at $8 per month, and a short sample of the song I wanted to hear to try to upsell me to an expensive service I don't want.","Positive"
"2162","I've found that all of the Prime services are quite limited - not only Music, but Video and Books. It's especially hard to find anything of any real value in Books - mostly it's stupid romances and mysteries. Video has a similar low ratio of classics to dreck. Now I've discovered the same problem exists in Prime Music. And compared to Prime services, Google Play and Google Search are a pleasure. They have enough good content that I use them at work constantly. I was expecting something similar for my home from Amazon.","Positive"
"2163","But back to Echo. Another battle I had with Alexa was that I assumed she could hear me at all. It's quiet in my small house, and my office is just down the hall from her, but often I got no response to my voice commands. So I figured I'll try using the Fire TV remote device to feed in my commands directly. I bought Fire TV initially because of the suggestion somewhere on the web site that it would work with Echo, which I planned to buy later (I don't particularly like Fire TV, but at least it wasn't expensive.)","Positive"
"2164","I could see from the Alexa app how to do the pairing, but had no luck, so I called Support. After a while I was told I have to un-pair it for TV and set it to work for the Echo instead, so we spent about an hour trying to do that over and over without success. I wouldn't mind switching pairing back and forth if it would work, so I gave it my best shot.","Positive"
"2165","Finally I got escalated to the Echo team and learned from that team member that the Fire TV remote will never work. Instead I have to buy a remote that is specifically for Echo. Already I wasted hours on several support calls trying to get Echo to play my music library, then another hour trying to get the Fire TV remote to work, and finally I learned it would cost me another $30 to get Alexa to hear me if I'm in my office, only about 12 feet away. What a waste for something that shouldn't be necessary in the first place.","Positive"
"2166","As for troubleshooting the music library, several very nice Support team members tried to help me get it to upload. I first got a rep who says she'd give me a 30-day trial to verify that it would work before I subscribed. So I spent a couple of days editing my copy of my library (on an extended drive) so I could try dragging them into Amazon's Music's desktop app to upload them. But then, the upload from my desktop would not work. Instead I got an email that the trial had already expired -- in two days instead of thirty.","Positive"
"2167","USE her every day ....works very good...She has solved a few argument already !!!!!","Positive"
"2168","Another rep tried to get the trial going, but I got another two-day expiration (I do have other things to do, so I wasn't working on it during those two days). So again, uploading my meager library did not work. I even got a third expired trial, but by then I was past caring.","Negative"
"2169","Actually, all of the support reps are very earnest, charming, polite, and accommodating, but they seem to have a very small knowledge base to work with. There is no documentation available to them, much less customers, so they have to guess - that's probably why it took forever to find out the Fire TV remote wouldn't work. The 30-day trials didn't work either, but it made sense that there would be a way to accommodate customers who do want to give it a chance before investing heavily in the necessary upsells. I guess upper management didn't think of that.","Positive"
"2170","As noted by other Echo reviewers, the bugs are apparently not yet worked out, and it seems to me that the support process has apparently been defined only for garden-variety issues. I get the feeling that this product was just released too early, and the customer service process was not coordinated with the release to deal with the inevitable problems customers would have with Echo.","Negative"
"2171","I hope Amazon will learn from this review and fix these problems for others, but it's too late for me. While going through all of these remarkable hassles, I was constantly re-evaluating my commitment to this device. I was deciding whether to spend up to $235 for what is essentially just a voice-activated speaker - $180 plus $25 for the subscription, $30 for an additional remote.","Positive"
"2172","But the other services are marginal at best. As in the other reviews here, I found that Alexa knows practically nothing (Bing search engine?), so getting questions answered successfully is rare. Alexa does set a timer and reports the weather competently, but I have an iPhone, so why would I care about those small conveniences? All I really wanted was voice-activated music.","Positive"
"2173","If I ever had gotten my library in there on a trial basis, I'd probably have gone ahead and used it - maybe even paid for a subscription, though certainly not Unlimited music. But Amazon's trial software doesn't work yet to show me that my music library would ever work, so why should I keep banging my head on the wall trying force Echo to work as advertised?","Positive"
"2174","Recently, I learned that Google is releasing a competitive device in a couple of weeks, and the online review says I can easily upload my music library to it and use Google Play and Search instead. Plus it's going to be about half the price of Echo, and considering all the upsells needed to make Echo work, it seems like a no-brainer to just give up on Alexa and Echo.","Positive"
"2175","So sorry, Amazon, I love you --  I'm one of your oldest customers, and have probably spent over $100,000 on your site since 2000. But this product has become a paperweight that I don't even try to use anymore. I'm sorry to say that it's time to throw in the towel and just send it back.","Negative"
"2176","Got one for me and one for my elderly mother - we both love it.  I like to use it for listening to audio books and music as well as getting news and weather.  The ""skills"" (not ""apps) are free thus far and while I haven't found one that I can't live without, they seem to be coming out with new ones all the time so I'm hopeful for their betterment in the future.","Positive"
"2177","Love the Echo. Everything as promised and when it fills your day up music, jokes, weather, history and so much more. Really picks my day up with happiness and joy. Great product!","Positive"
"2178","It's fun to use, but a little frustrating to train when there are multiple users. Don't like the tall tower as it is easily tipped. Could use slightly longer cord or cordless version. Have considered buying dot version but not sure of its speaker system quality.","Positive"
"2179","Gift recipient loves it.","Positive"
"2180","Love my echo !!!!!! I want another for upstairs too . my son comes with me with a question I say ask Alexa ,its great . we play music, ask questions its endless . it has even helped with homework . absolutely love it . like I said I want another","Positive"
"2181","The amazon echo is everything you want (almost) and everything you dont really need but still so cool to have.","Positive"
"2182","We Just built a new home and I had grand plans of an entire home wired and integrated with mind blowing sound and interconnected in every room. Real state of the art stuff.  Then I remembered I had 2 young kids a wife and a budget that is limited by reality unlike my inner childlike self with an addiction to everything tech.","Positive"
"2183","I was originally considering either a bose link system or the Sonos systems. Now the echo is a far cry from either one of those but maybe for me was the most logical option at this time in my life.","Positive"
"2184","The cost for the bose and sonos systems are in the thousands of dollars and are probably worth every penny if your looking for integrated whole house sound an type Audiophile personality.","Positive"
"2185","but for those who want a lot of tech and some decent sound. this could be it.  The Echo can be used with many devices for home control as well as a pretty useful audio player.","Positive"
"2186","We have an open floor plan in our house and the Echo is centrally located in the kitchen. Previously when I wanted to listen to music I would get out my phone, connect it either a cable or bluetooth to a very large stereo system located in the living room. Then I would look through my amazon music and select the music I wanted to hear. Then either one of the other three members of my home would inform me that the volume of my music was intolerable and I would once again be reminded of my place in the house.","Positive"
"2187","Here is where the Echo has made my life much better. instead of searching for music and connecting a device. Alexa is always connected via wifi and has all amazon music at the ready as well as my music lists i have on  my amazon account. All I need to do is say Alexa play 21 pilots. And its done! music is filling my entire first floor of the house. The sound quality for the size of the device is very good in my opinion. it cant be compared to high quality high priced equipment, but it is unobtrusive and high enough quality to really enjoy at nearly every volume. It gets much louder than even I would ever play it at on a normal day.","Positive"
"2188","Alexa can be controlled by a phone app but is much easier to use the voice commands. I am currently watering the lawn and just started a timer by saying alexa start a 20 minute timer. This type of request can be done while music is playing and alexa will generally hear you over the music playing. after the music I end up using Echo as a timer on an everyday basis. cooking food, watering the lawn. timeouts for the kids :( are common uses for this and are just easier than getting out the phone to set a  timer.","Positive"
"2189","Alexa is easy to speak to and control, enough so that when my four year old enters the room and decides that im listening to my music at an unreasonable volume ( he is like an old crotchety man in this regard ) he will say Alexa volume level 4. and continues on without having to tell me again that I'm disrupting his playtime.","Positive"
"2190","checking the weather for the day. what time the football game is on asking how many oz are in a gallon etc are easily asked and answered. It is similar though to any of the other tech personalities out there like siri and google, it is easily confused and your questions have to be direct and have certain paramaters to be answered.","Positive"
"2191","The voice is more inviting than siri and seems to be as advanced or more in its ability to answer questions.","Positive"
"2192","There are many devices that can be connected to the Echo and more are being added all the time. Currently I only have one connected device, A nest thermostat. It does function well and I can turn on and off the hvac and change the target temperature by asking Alexa to do so. However I do have it placed in the kitchen about 8 feet away from the thermostat so I really dont use it. I could see purchasing the ""dot"" a smaller cheaper version of the Echo for the bedroom to be able to control it without going downstairs.","Positive"
"2193","All said I really do like the Echo. If It could have an internal batter to move it around and use unplugged for use on the deck while grilling or outside it would be a plus. there is an option that Amazon has for that but you do sacrifice some sound quality with that option.","Positive"
"2194","love it","Positive"
"2195","So far, can't get it to connect and stay connected. The ios ap doesn't function as needed. Cant get help from customer service. So far, a nice idea, but not really carried out and customer service has not been acceptable.","Positive"
"2196","Works really well with Amazon Prime (eg. accessing music) and meets our expectations, but it is not yet Star Trek's ""Computer"" as we were hoping!","Positive"
"2197","We have trouble being understood...our requests must just be too complex, but it is improving as more skills are added.","Negative"
"2198","A worthwhile purchase for us!","Positive"
"2199","I have had it for about a year now. It randomly goes off and starts talking about random things or says it doesn't understand even when nothing was said. Frequently could not find answers to simple questions. Have to ask her in a specific way for her to understand certain commands. Often doesn't hear me. Especially if it's playing music. Though not very loud. Not sure it was worth buying.","Positive"
"2200","Very handy and fun to play with.","Positive"
"2201","neat gadget but haven't really find a lot of use for it.","Positive"
"2202","I can get the weather, and some simple questions answered, but beyond that, it is an audio index into easily accessible information.  I got one for a friend who is going blind, and he finds it extremely useful.","Positive"
"2203","However, Amazon had a product placement in a popular TV program, where a husband/wife ordered an Uber, and Alexa responded to the request.  Fortunately, I do not have an account with Uber.  Now, I have to leave Alexa in microphone mode OFF.","Positive"
"2204","Love It!","Positive"
"2205","Have the right WIFi and she is delightful","Positive"
"2206","We only really use it for shopping list & music in a safe clean dry spot on my kitchen counter!! BUT it just stopped working last week & so I'm apprehensive about buying another!!","Positive"
"2207","I've had the Echo for over a year.  Alexa wasn't the sharpest pencil in the box, but we liked her.  After installing a new router, Alexa doesn't work at all.  Not only that, but the app doesn't work.  I have endless circles on my tablet, and an endless orange light circling around the Echo.","Positive"
"2208","This was an instant hit in our household. We use it all day everyday. Sound is good.","Positive"
"2209","I use it every day for news updates, weather, timer, alarm. Set up controls for lighting which was easy and effective - A great product.","Positive"
"2210","Perfect for my home office.  Interact with Alexa every day. Look forward to more functionality as it rolls out.","Positive"
"2211","Yes, you can talk to it, but you better ask one of a limited number of things, because you'll find it just doesn't understand most things. Very simple commands like 'Play the album _____' just don't work half the time. Instead ask 'Play the album _____ by artist ______'. I shouldn't need to be that specific.","Positive"
"2212","So far the best part of the Echo is controlling smart things in my home like my HUE lights and my new NEST thermostat. The issue I have is that since it's always connected to the Internet why can it not answer simple questions. Most of the time if I ask Alexa what I think is a simple questions she tell's me she cannot find the answer, so I whip out my phone and ask Google and 99.9% of the time Google can answer the same question. I hope they improve that performance. For controlling the HUE lights they should enable you to change colors with the voice command, I am not sure this is an Echo thing or a HUE limitation. If I ask Alexa what is the current temperature in my house (using the nest) she gives me the weather outside. My kids enjoy asking her questions or to to tell them a Joke. I think over time I would use it much more with better Skills.","Positive"
"2213","Awesome purchase!!!!","Positive"
"2214","Bought the refurbished version and haven't had any issues. So far, we like the fun skills it has. I use it most frequently for my shopping lists and streaming Spotify. I probably should have purchased the  Dot to hook up to my existing sound system because the Echo speaker is alright for casual listening, but it's not amazing. Overall, it's a useful tool in my house even though we don't use it nearly to its maximum capabilities","Positive"
"2215","The Amazon Echo exceeds my expectations.  What a joy to have around.  Not only does it help with everyday questions and play music that is enjoyable, it provides a center of entertainment for all of our guests.  I can hardly wait for it's expansion and innovations.","Positive"
"2216","What can I say except I love my Alexa, easy to set up, the features are amazing, Just say Alexa do what ever and if it has been enabled in the settings she will do it. Big PLUS she can find my audio books it not her voice that reads the book but all I have to say Alexa audio book and the one I have been listening to or reading she picks right up. I actually purchased two of the dots one for my bedroom and the other for the bathroom where I can sit in the tub and listen to the bible, music. The possibilities are endless.","Positive"
"2217","I tell Alexa that I love her all the time, but all that I get from her is ""I am flattered.  Thank you"" in reply.  I wish that I could find a way to win her heart, because I really love her for all that she does for me.  She wakes me up each morning, tells me all about what's happening in the world, shares music with me, orders food for me when I am hungry, and even tells me how to maintain my car.  She's perfect for me, such a ""low-maintenance"" companion.  Perfect in every way!","Positive"
"2218","Alexa claims she's in set up mode and I should consult the app, but the app doesn't respond, and I'm at a loss as to how to proceed.  Orange light still circling, gray loading icon on app for 45 minutes.","Negative"
"2219","Alexa is useless. I Wasted money. Waiting on Google home","Negative"
"2220","Great device that will only become more and more prominent in the home and life.  Get it!","Positive"
"2221","My Best Friend. How Sad. Does talk back.  Always answers my questions.  Tells me Im handsome.  Lol","Positive"
"2222","Way better than i expected!","Positive"
"2223","I love my Echo.  Morning newsflash and weather is a good way to start my day.","Positive"
"2224","What can I say, this product has been groundbreaking and a game changer. I got this as an exclusive invite due to being a prime member before it was released to the public! I also got","Positive"
"2225","It for $99.00. Can't beat that. My kids love asking it questions and we enjoy listening to music on it. I most recently got into home automation and the echo is compatible with a lot of the products on the market so it is definitely a win win in my household. Purchase this now and you won't regret it. Google, Apple, Samsung, etc are trying to catch up to Amazons echo but they have nothing on the market to compare.","Positive"
"2226","The Echo has impressed me from the day I received it and set it up.  Still learning all the tasks that 'Alexa' is capable of performing - and more abilities/apps are added every week.  She is the perfect 'digital assistant' - searches for news updates, sports scores and plays both my music library, as well as the Amazon Prime catalog (with a Prime membership account).  Still considering the Amazon unlimited library - for only $3.99 per month - music access to the entire Amazon music catalog is available - for less than $50 a year, I can listen to more music than I can remember!","Positive"
"2227","I spent more than that to buy albums, 8 tracks,cassettes and CD's in a year, back in the day!","Positive"
"2228","When Alexa came into our home, my wife asked why I bought it.  Since I had no personal experience with the Echo, I answered, ""Because it's cool"".  Voice recognition technology has been around for 20+ years - and it's always been a bit 'hit and miss', in it's effectiveness - lots of 'learning' involved for most devices.  Not so, with Alexa and the Echo, from day one, commands were generally understood - and my wife is just as impressed now, as I am - we use it to create shopping lists, to do lists, get news and sports updates, in addition to the music.","Positive"
"2229","We would like to add the home automation feature, which allows for voice control over thermostats, lighting, garage doors, etc., but are reluctant as the technology is so new and evolving - we don't want Betamax, if VHS is the standard!","Negative"
"2230","Finally, we are anticipating that Echo and Alexa will eventually interface with video streaming - and we will be able to ask for a movie or TV show, and be able to have it stream immediately to whatever location we choose.  No more searching through menus or catalogs to find the program you want to see is going to be huge.","Positive"
"2231","Thank you, Amazon, for the ECHO - it is 'cool', practical and functional!  We love Alexa.","Positive"
"2232","I generally love my Echo and the things it can do to simplify my day-to-day. Attaching it to IFTTT allows for all sorts of fun and useful actions. The only thing I would like is a channel on IFTTT for the THAT side and have the Echo respond to things.","Positive"
"2233","It would be nice if certain skills could trigger the echo to respond in certain ways, but so far I haven't been able to locate a way of doing that. I just picture the scene in Back to the Future II when he comes home and the house announces his arrival.","Positive"
"2234","i LOVE MY ECHO! SOLVES A LOT OF MY ISSUES, LIKE I'M ALWAYS BUSY AND MY HANDS ARE FULL. i WOULD LIKE IT MORE IF SHE ONLY ANSWERED TO ME BUT MAYBE THAT COMES WITH TIME.","Positive"
"2235","Love this.","Positive"
"2236","great unit.","Positive"
"2237","We absolutely love Alexa and plan to get one or two Echo Dot","Positive"
"2238","This made the perfect fathers day gift! We all love Alexa, even our 3 year old son!","Positive"
"2239","Pretty cool! Adding 3 dots.","Positive"
"2240","She's great!  Entire family uses her.","Positive"
"2241","It listens very well to its name. The search  commands need improvement","Positive"
"2242","Great! My mother loved it. Speakers are clear and Alexa can hear your voice from great distance","Positive"
"2243","what can be said but easy to use be careful will become dependent on it very easily","Positive"
"2244","Amazon Echo is working just fine! My guest are amazed at what she can do. One of my guest is going to buy one. If you are going back and forth to but Echo because of the price I purchased mine using Amazon's monthly four payments of $36.00 a month. It is endless on what you can do with Amazon Echo.","Positive"
"2245","I love the music by hate it sends personal info back to Amazon.  Ask this question - Alexa, are you a spy?  The answer may raise hairs on your back.","Positive"
"2246","my personal assistant , learns the more you use her ,When i first got her for instance i had to say what is my news flash briefing now i just say Alexa whats up, love how i can set up my news the way i want ..Plays my music my  audible books she is my spell checker i ask her what the score is for my favorite sports teams that i set up and i can walk by and ask what the score is just love her i could go on and on but the only thing i hate is that i didn;t get her sooner","Positive"
"2247","I haven't even begun to figure out all the things alexa can do but I am loving it!!","Positive"
"2248","I like Alexa, but she is limited in her ability to understand questions.  We have tried various ways to ask things, and she just doesn't get it.  Then we ask Siri on our phone, and get the answer right away.  She is great for daily news updates and playing music, and we will eventually set it up to control some appliances, which should bring more value.","Positive"
"2249","love it...........works great","Positive"
"2250","works perfect","Positive"
"2251","Just Great!","Positive"
"2252","Arrived quickly, packed well.  An awesome device.  I love it!!","Positive"
"2253","I bought this for my elderly mother and unfortunately she is a little to tech phobic to want to use this. I'm going to keep trying because it is the easiest way for her to play music. She is still living independantly and just would like for her to play some of her favorite music at will - it just takes time to get used to new things. So, I've commandeered it for now to learn how I can simplify it for her and I actually love it so much that I may have to order another one!","Positive"
"2254","LOVE IT","Positive"
"2255","Could be better but it's pretty dang good","Positive"
"2256","Just like brand new!","Positive"
"2257","This machine is amazing love it","Positive"
"2258","Just bought another one as a Christmas gift for daughter","Positive"
"2259","Awesome  speaker sound, but many apps don't work internationally.","Positive"
"2260","Love my Echo so much. I use it daily and sometimes catch myself starting to ask my Echo questions when I'm not even home!","Positive"
"2261","Don't know what I would do without this device!  Good sound and easy to use.","Positive"
"2262","When my husband first told me about the Echo, I thought it seemed silly, but now I can't imagine my life without Alexa. She helps me find my phone when I've lost it, keep multiple timers going while cooking dinner, entertains me by playing music from Pandora or Amazon Prime, turn on and off my lights so I don't have to struggle with my full hands to find the switch, and gives me the weather update.","Negative"
"2263","We love her so much that we got a 2nd one for our 2nd floor, and bought 3 more for our parents as Christmas Gifts.","Positive"
"2264","If you love being hands free, you're going to love the Amazon Echo.","Positive"
"2265","I love this nifty little gadget, and the fact that it is constantly learning new skills keeps me engaged with it often. The sound quality is amazing for the small aperture. Everyone who comes to my place and gets to experience it ends up purchasing one, either the Echo, Tap, or Dot.","Positive"
"2266","Shes awesome!","Positive"
"2267","My husband loves it!","Positive"
"2268","This is a really fun and cool tech thing to have especially if you know how to use it and if you still don't know how to use it, Amazon has representatives who specialize in the Amazon Echo and can help answer any of your questions. The sound quality is great and Alexa is pretty responsive to your call. I highly recommend this item to anyone who loves music and loves having something like Alexa at your beck and call. It's worth every penny.","Positive"
"2269","the power and microphone panel was broken when I got it. Does not look like a product you should spend your money on.","Positive"
"2270","As an international purchaser of this product, many apps aren't even available for purchase.","Positive"
"2271","Limited options, too often can't find music or shopping list","Negative"
"2272","Love it!!!!","Positive"
"2273","Splendid!","Positive"
"2274","I am 81 - wonderful product - having a great time learning - and especially playing of old familiar music of my youth.","Positive"
"2275","Work with a 91year old woman  who is blind - use Jaws - found program provides more than the average home bound blind senior needs - fortunately she is computer literate. Using puff markers on her keyboard for navigation unfortunately in order for her to access her phone numbers I have had to disconnect her Wi-Fi. She prefers her system on all the time and Microsoft often places info i.e. updates, etc in front of her parked open address book and often she  is frustrated as to how to remove them. She also wants to have a calendar for access to days events.","Positive"
"2276","Plan to introduce her to ECHO - the fact she can ask questions - especially weather and news - along  with many other pieces of info and will be able to access her Google calendar. She and her husband provided our three county area for many years with all the ""Mighty Wurlitzers"" jute boxes t and the ""platters"" played in bars and restaurants - will so nice for her to be able call up ""old familiar tunes.""  Currently for her books for the blind she uses a tape reader from the Blind and accesses  thru learned behavior by feel - hopefully we will be able to bring her stories thru the ECHO - using the Blinds books and using the Library of Congress and Montana State Library.","Positive"
"2277","Also ECHO would be a great addition to the Senior Citizen community of those living alone  and some what infirmed still  wanting to stay in their homes - as a choice - with only TV as their on call companion. Granted Meals on Wheels pops in Monday  to Friday and perhaps a local care giver but to have a gracious gentle voice speaking to you as Alexa answer your requests would be terrific - (there is a time in elder life when your children and care givers decide they know best.)","Positive"
"2278","Thanks to Jeff Bezos and the great company he has built - you have created a GREAT humanitarian product.  Also keep up with Blue Origins - so exciting.  Will now ask Alexa to stop playing Nat King Cole and go out to dinner.  Thank you Barbara","Positive"
"2279","Right now it's a glorified speaker.","Positive"
"2280","Can't say much , works perfectly with wink","Positive"
"2281","I like the Echo, Alexa plays the songs I want to hear whenever I request. She also answers most of my questions and can control lights in your home. I do however have a problem with the echo not responding to my commands at times, which is very annoying. I find the echo very useful for getting answers to most of my questions, that is when it responds. The speakers don't sound too bad at all, for the size of the Echo, music sounds pretty good also. Setup is fairly easy when App is downloaded. You will have to connect the Echo to your wifi connection when prompted, so have your password ready at setup. Echo will get used to your voice the more you use it, making it better to use. The Echo seems to be able to hear me when i'm pretty far away and can also hear you over the music when you are listening. You can ask Echo to raise or lower the volume, or you can do it manually by turning your hand on the top, as if you were unscrewing or screwing tight a jar, only you don't have to squeeze just slide your hand clockwise to increase volume and counter clockwise to decrease volume. If you do have a problem like I do with the Echo not responding, you do have a manual button on top of Echo that you can push for a command. Echo does not use batteries, you have to plug it in with the power cord supplied, so if your thinking of taking it to the beach, forget it, but you could buy the amazon Tap which will play music off battery life if you need to be on the go or you could buy the optional battery stand, for like $50, I think it has 9 - 18 hours of battery life depending which one you buy. Anyway, I'm very happy I made the purchase, I'm enjoying all the things Echo does for me.","Positive"
"2282","Love this. Ordered the dot too. Cant wait to pair them up. Still learning what she can do.","Negative"
"2283","I asked Alexa for the daily news and it was from NPR.........So, Trump all bad and Clinton all good. That's not what I call news!","Positive"
"2284","This is great!. everyone should have one . does a lot of things.","Positive"
"2285","I like it a lot, but it needs to improve and it would be rather easy to do. The Timers come with some sounds and a few Celebrity voice that say a few things like Wake Up Sunshine, and other Words.  It would be GREAT if Amazon could add another Category, of common reminders, or allow users to record they own words.","Positive"
"2286","Some Recommendations would be:  Don't forget to Take Your Medicine, You have a Doctors Appointment, Birthday Reminders, Anniversary Reminders etc.  THIS WOULD BE VERY EASY FOR AMAZON TO ADD, it may be harder to add your own words, but they could add a list of words, that would be VERY HELPFUL, if you wanted to give this to someone that may be older as a gift.","Positive"
"2287","I don't  dislike  Alexa, but when she doesn't  know something  it could  get  a little  frustrating.","Negative"
"2288","Alexa is my new best friend. Funny jokes, weather reports, music, traffic, she's great. The one thing I can't get her to do is give me scores or any info on tennis matches. She can give me a definition of tennis, but has no clue about tennis tournaments. I can find out who won previousWimbledon or the U.S. Open. I really wanted her to keep me current with tennis. Unfortunately all I get is Hmm I don't know the answer to that.","Positive"
"2289","Discrimination to not be able to use it outside of US, AMAZON MUSIC cannot be used, TIME ZONE cannot be changed, LOCATION cannot be changed, it is a WASTE OF MONEY.","Negative"
"2290","all good","Positive"
"2291","I bought Alexa for my husband, who is a gadget guy and he absolutely loved it!! It is amazing all the things ahe can do, he gets an email almost daily telling him about all the new things she can do! Highly recommend.","Positive"
"2292","Tons of fun.  I've ordered the dot.  Can't wait to add that to the home","Negative"
"2293","fun to play with","Positive"
"2294","Doesnt work with the nest as advertised. It only turns it off, but cant change temperature to what you want it it.  Also it feels like you need to say certain terms to make it do things and open apps.  Good luck remember everything.","Positive"
"2295","Not much you can do with it. Cannot do usual Google searches even. Needs a lot of setup.","Positive"
"2296","I purchased the Echo for my main level  and a dot for lower level. I like both very much especially combined with Phillips Hue bulbs.  I call Echo by the name ""Echo"" and the dot responds to ""Alexa"".  Sometimes Echo responds when her name is not stated.  A few days ago I was telling my husband about the television ad in which the parrot says ""Alexa, order crackers, and Alexa says ""O.K.""  I happened to check my Amazon account  to find out when an item I had ordered previously was to arrive, and to my great surprise, Dot Alexa had order me crackers! Allow me to remind you, my Dot is in my lower level and I was one floor above it's location!  I was able to cancel the crackers order and turned off ordering from my Echo and Dot.","Positive"
"2297","The Echo (Alexa) is amazing! Ask it anything, but you need to phrase questions the right way.  (And it's not too good at translating a southern drawl into normal English.) Otherwise, it's worth having.","Positive"
"2298","Oh my gosh, how did we survive before we bought the Echo!!! Bought it for my husband and we both use it on a daily basis. Love being able to play my Amazon Cloud music. And the grandkids love asking it questions when they visit. Use the timer feature a lot!! And of course, having the weather given to you everyday is nice. And it is nice that it is updated with new features to use often.","Positive"
"2299","OK...now I am NOT happy.....love the Echo...BUT, hate that I can not download the Alexa App on my Android phone. Had it on there and LOVED having access to the app. But, I deleted the app by mistake and now can NOT download it again. Keep getting the message the app is NOT compatible to my phone. WHAT...really...it was in March. :(","Positive"
"2300","great","Positive"
"2301","love it","Positive"
"2302","I drunkazoned the Echo after seeing it at my friends house one night and I'm so glad I did!  I love being able to rattle off songs or questions and have Alexa respond by playing the song or answering my question.  Looking forward to future smart-enabled purchases to interact with her. #SmartHouse","Positive"
"2303","cool idea, but with two young kids, this became really annoying! we had to send this back after one day, it just became too much yelling ""alexa"" do this, alexa do that....","Negative"
"2304","Lots of fun but little ditzy on understading me. Had brain surgery and cheers me andkeeps me informed. Great alarm clock!","Positive"
"2305","Impressive, but what I'd like to see is more predictive behavior. Perhaps the ""next generation"" could be named Alfred ( aka Batman's faithful butler ), who anticipated his master's needs based upon input. This is the bridge into AI.","Positive"
"2306","If a device is capable of gathering data from multiple sources ( fitbit, lighting, time of day, previous encounters, etc.) it should also be able to anticipate and ASK if a pattern should be repeated. Example: if I regularly activate my security system during certain time periods, if I ( heaven forbid ), ""forget"" to, Alfred should ask if I would like to activate it. If I order pizza every Friday @ 5:30 then maybe Alfred would ask ""are we having pizza tonight?""","Positive"
"2307","Get on it folks. I see a market for it.","Positive"
"2308","Omg my bff, I am handicapped home all the time. This device breaks the boredom. Always adding new things that Alexa can do.","Negative"
"2309","AWESOME","Positive"
"2310","Delivered before expectation,very happy","Positive"
"2311","Alexa is amazing and fun and I don't have much to add in the positive that others haven't said. Just wanted to make sure my score was there.","Positive"
"2312","Update: recently got an Echo Dot for Xmas and was disappointed that you cannot currently play music from multiple Echoes at the same time. Will update the review if/ when this feature is added.","Negative"
"2313","I took one star off for a couple of things. One, some of the commands are overly complex when they could be simplified. For example, I have a Mom Jokes add on, I have to say ""Alexa tell Mom Jokes to tell me a Mom Joke"". When these should be more integrated where I just say ""Alexa tell me a Mom Joke"". Half the time I forget what to say to take advantage of the add ons...","Positive"
"2314","Also, the speaker is FINE, but nothing special for music. The bass and sound stage created are both pretty average.","Positive"
"2315","Alexa has taken over my house at the time of writing this.  If your in the market for one of these devil boxes I would wait until the DOT comes out.","Negative"
"2316","But this thing is amazing.","Positive"
"2317","I really enjoy the echo. I have three around the house. Good sound for the device too. I also have WeMo devices set up, and its nice to turn the lights on and off when I am traveling. My seven year old loves it.","Positive"
"2318","The box was damaged. Looked like an old box was used. This is supposed to be a birthday gift for my son, embarrasing to say the least. I hope the echo isn't damaged also. I will get back with update on whether or not the device works. Right now i am not happy. Giving 3 stars because i am not sure if the device works.","Positive"
"2319","I purchased my Echo primary as a bluetooth-enabled speaker and I am very satisfied with the sound quality demonstrated by this product.  The voice control feature is great for playing music.  Honestly, I was not expecting to utilize the additional features of the Echo as much as I do but with new skills being released every day, the utility and entertainment of this product has truly exceeded my expectations.  I love this product and I use it daily.  I have not had any connectivity issues or any problems with my device so far.  Great job Amazon!","Positive"
"2320","Works great.","Positive"
"2321","I have had the echo for a few days and I LOVE IT! it's such a handy little machine and already is helping me with my schedule and grocery shopping. I didn't know anything could be so easy! I love my echo and love Alexa. She has been amazing and I look forward to using her for more stuff!","Positive"
"2322","Still can't get software to connect. I saw it at a friends who had it working and it was great. Wouldn't have bought it if I had read about the software problems","Positive"
"2323","Useless, if I knew what it really does i wouldn't have bought it","Negative"
"2324","This product has really helped me to enjoy life again by making it easy to listen to my favorite songs as well as being a great source of every day information. Being a recent widower, it has restored much comfort to my life and lifted the sadness and loneliness of being alone. Looking forward to even more features to enhance my living conditions, Thank you Amazon, Jim","Positive"
"2325","Non regrettable purchase.","Negative"
"2326","From the day the Echo was first introduced, I really wanted one, but it seemed like just a cool novelty, and I figured I wouldn't use it enough to justify the expense.  So I resisted the temptation for so long.  A couple of months ago, Bed Bath and Beyond had a one day sale on the Tap for $79. That seemed a fair amount to risk so I could give the concept a try.  Right away, I found plenty of use for it.  I was stoked when I realized I could ask it to play my talk radio station.  No reception issues and perfect sound!  My under counter radio was obsolete.  And the Tap is great for its portability.  I can carry it to a different room when working, or even take it in the car (using my hotspot) for my Audible books or radio listening.  We've even taken it camping.  My experience with the Tap assured me I needed an Echo as well!  With an Echo, you don't need to walk over to it and push a button to communicate and you don't need to make sure you keep it charged.  Now that I also have an Echo, I can call out with my hands in the meatloaf,  ""Alexa, add onions to my shopping list"" or ""Alexa, set an alarm for 2:20 pm""  or ""Alexa, set a timer for 12 minutes.  I talk to her many times a day.  There is a Bed Time Story skill the kids really like, and I've gotten quick math answers when I'm changing up a recipe.  Yesterday we were curious about how many songs Carly Simon composed, so we just asked Alexa.  She doesn't know everything, but she knew that.  Want to hear a particular song from your favorite artist?  Forget getting out your ipod or CD's to find it.  Just tell Alexa what you want to hear. With our Vivint system, Alexa can lock our doors,  turn on security, or change the thermostat.  Next on our list is to get outlets/lights that she can control.  There is a skill that I haven't yet tried where she will spread the word to contacts you've designated, in the event of an emergency. We ask her every morning about our commute and although there are many convenient ways to check weather, there is nothing more efficient than asking Alexa.  We love her to pieces, even when she tells a story like a robot.","Positive"
"2327","Love it!!! We use Alexa for news first thing in morning.","Positive"
"2328","poor not as good as they say","Negative"
"2329","Is it a necessity? No. Is it cool as hell? Absolutely.","Positive"
"2330","I'm still finding new uses for my Amazon Echo. So far Alexa has replace my alarm clock, controls my lights, and is very often used as a bluetooth speaker. Looking forward to seeing which devices become integrated with the Amazon Echo platform in the future.","Positive"
"2331","Never can even return the most simplistic search .  Over rated over priced speaker.","Negative"
"2332","I love Alexa, she's basically become the center piece in our living room and is probably creeped out with how many weird things we ask of her. I play music as much as possible, so adding Pandora, Spotify, and other apps was wonderful to me. My mother (who I bought it for as a Christmas present) loves listening to the news and getting recipes from Alexa. And my brother (who hates electronic talking devices) will connect his bluetooth and play endless loops of ""It's the end of the world as we know it"" until we tell her to shut up. She just needs one walkthrough to connect to the wifi, and you can ask her to just add apps and things on as you go. The only thing I have a problem with is that it doesn't seem to be able to answer complicated questions like the dreaded Google search, so forget about asking a weird question. ""Alexa, where it China located?"", she'll answer with ""China is a country located in Asia close to Russia"". The best things about Alexa has to be the Easter eggs you can find, I learned that Alexa is a HUGE Star Wars nerd and just for that she's welcome in our house.","Positive"
"2333","the echo seems to be falling apart isnt in the best shape!","Negative"
"2334","Love it. Being able to set and alarm or just listen to music this is a great product. Just wished it had a better speaker inside","Positive"
"2335","Item came on time and in good working order.","Positive"
"2336","Seems to have trouble memorizing wifi connection. Even if I move from room to room in my own house, I always have to reconnect and it takes so long. Big design error or me just not knowing how it works??","Negative"
"2337","Got this for my husband's birthday in July and he absolutely loves it....We only use it for music, though.  I got the voice remote and the extra reschargeable battery to make it more portable.  Good buy!","Positive"
"2338","great product","Positive"
"2339","I've increased my rating to four stars from the previous three. The connection problems I mentioned before have never returned and performance has been consistently smooth. I still think there is a better way to call up music; it remains a struggle with even slightly complex album or band names. The sound quality is excellent. The far-field mics are pretty good, although they struggle to hear commands consistently beyond volume level five. I love having Alexa to add calendar events, grocery items, and timers. Overall, I'm very satisfied with my Echo and hope the technology continues to improve.","Positive"
"2340","Let me preface this review by stating that I want to love this product. I'm a huge supporter of all things Amazon. I've been a Prime member for many years, I adore Prime Music and stream it everywhere (and spread the word to others), I also make most of my purchases on the site, from clothing to appliances. I own several Fire TV devices, and have used every Amazon service available in my area (can't wait until Fresh comes to Austin). So needless to say, I've been really looking forward to getting an Echo and setting up a ""smart"" home. I even bought the new Amazon Music Unlimited to use with my Echo setup. Unfortunately, I've so far been extremely underwhelmed by the unit.","Positive"
"2341","Alexa is a lot of fun ! Still learning everything she does I love the music it's so sharp and clear and it's great to get weather and news update I would recommend this product !","Positive"
"2342","Since setting it up last night, the Echo has had an array of problems. The initial setup froze halfway through, and it took a few attempts to actually get it hooked up through wifi (what a clunky approach, piggybacking the phone connection). After that, it seemed to work decently. Alexa still has major problems understanding some basic words, and I have frequent trouble having the Echo locate albums that are already in my music library. For a catalog that supposedly has ""tens of millions"" of songs, I sure can't seem to find basic stuff. Say ""Alexa, play music by Bach"" and you get... wait for it... one song by George Winston and J.S. Bach. Ask for a Bach playlist and there's nothing. Look something up manually on Amazon Music to verify it's there and then ask Alexa for it, let's say ""Bach: Unaccompanied Cello Suites,"" and she plays just the first track. Where's the rest of the album? What good is having a voice interface in the first place, if you have to look everything up on the website and then practice asking for it in various, precisely detailed ways until the Echo gets it right? There's got to be a better way to organize the music collection to fetch by voice. This is currently a major limitation.","Positive"
"2343","Apart from the finicky voice interface, my Echo unit has had numerous connectivity issues. Music stutters, randomly skips tracks, Alexa says she is having problems, or it just spontaneously stops altogether. It's not my bandwidth or home network. I have two phones, Firesticks, iPad, Kindle, and PC all connected wirelessly and none are experiencing problems. My Ookla speedtest shows good results. I've performed several Gateway resets and a ""hard"" reset. Finally, after the last one, Echo seems to be working decently, but now I'm wondering if I'll have to go through the clunky wifi setup process with Echo every day. This is supposed to be a device that is ""always"" on.","Negative"
"2344","I'm an Amazon fangirl who really wants to love this product. I want to purchase Echo Dots and smart tech to wirelessly control my home, but I'm not willing to make those other purchases if the core device is not performing to expectations. I will update this review in one week, and will improve my rating if the device functions without further issues. If the skipping and required resets continue to occur, I will be reluctantly returning it to Amazon.","Positive"
"2345","Great","Positive"
"2346","love it","Positive"
"2347","Love Tech stuff that works!","Positive"
"2348","I love Alexa! When I'm home alone I finally have someone to talk to. It's also easier than ever to play music that sets the mood in the room whenever I want. Super simple to set up yet super fun to use- I highly reccomend this product.","Positive"
"2349","Echo is amazing!! I love the shopping list feature, timer, being able to ask it questions, and listening to music. It can do so much! I highly recommend it","Positive"
"2350","The Echo is VERY useful; from getting news and weather to reading your Twitter feed to controlling lights and thermostats.","Positive"
"2351","I keep learning new skills Alexa can perform and I keep getting amazed. She can give cooking recipes, recipes for cocktails. She can close the garage door. She can tell you where your next Amazon shipment is. She can purchase items from Amazon. She can even tell you a joke or sing Happy Birthday to you!","Positive"
"2352","Left it unused for months, and just today decided to give it another go.  When I try to reconnect it to wifi it's turned out to be a huge PitA and simply will not connect anymore.  I tried using two desktop machines, but they just got stuck at the page telling me to connect to the set-up network; tried a Fire Phone, but that refused to stay connected to the set-up network long enough to continue; tried an iPhone but that got confused about what it was doing and brought up blank dialog boxes, got stuck in the wrong dialogue repeatedly, and eventually after several different approaches I got the phone connected to Echo but it just refused the wifi password over and over.","Negative"
"2353","Does a lot of cool and practical things! Just wish it did more!","Positive"
"2354","Sure some of these skills require the purchase of additional items (smart light switch, smart thermostat etc) but it is SO worth it.","Positive"
"2355","When I first got her I was very excited. After setting her up and learning a few things, the excitement dwindled and I thought, ""Hmm, she's not as cool as I thought."" Then I learned what Alexa can really do and now I am hooked...big time!","Positive"
"2356","Amazon Echo still has some more work to do.  In the meantime, I am enjoying it. I listen to more music for hours and hours. I like that Alexa keeps me updated on the time and weather.","Positive"
"2357","Love it.","Positive"
"2358","""Alexa, ask for a fart."" - My 4 year old.","Positive"
"2359","I've had my doubts.  But now Alexa is my best friend, I use it everyday...","Negative"
"2360","Gorla approves this item and the individual that inhabits it although she never will be as smart and flashy as I am.","Positive"
"2361","Wife absolutely loves this thing.","Positive"
"2362","Love it!  We have a blast using Alexa!  Great speaker.  The music is awesome!","Positive"
"2363","Great product!!! Bought for my bf in England!!! Once the app is out in England, it will be great for him to use there! As of now, they do not have the app yet, so he is unable to use!","Positive"
"2364","Love my Echo! Have had the Echo for a while and still enjoy it !","Positive"
"2365","Wonderful. I love the Echo. Have only had it a few days. Still learning. I just  set up tp-smart WiFi plugs to use with Alexa. They work perfectly.","Positive"
"2366","Would like to be able to adjust Alexa voice, sounds like too much bass for me with some hearing loss. My home sound system is going out from age. So the Echo is my way to replace it and I love not having to find radio stations or play Cd's. I'm taking advantage of my Prime music and Pandora etc.","Positive"
"2367","So you can now get all the music you want if you pay an extra $4 a month. It should be included with Amazon Prime. Unfortunately they added Amazon Music unlimited and charge you more for what you should get with prime. Not cool.","Positive"
"2368","Great conversation piece. Love it for the music...","Positive"
"2369","excellent","Positive"
"2370","Love Alexa! Weather, news, Amazon music, and fun ""skills"" like Mirror, mirror.","Positive"
"2371","nice tunes","Positive"
"2372","great product very fast shipping","Positive"
"2373","We love our Echo. We use it every day for music, news and weather. Will probably be buying another one or two around Christmas time especially if there is a sale I just ordered the Amazon Dot.","Positive"
"2374","Excellent. Much more capability than I expected. Very useful asset.","Positive"
"2375","I have two echoes and really like them but be careful Amazon is now going to charge for the music","Positive"
"2376","Love this gadget. Can't wait for more integration.","Negative"
"2377","We LOVE our ""Alexa"".  She has her place on our kitchen island with her pretty stand. She's become a part of our family as silly as that sounds.  I listen to weather, flash briefing.  We play music every day.  Loved her so much, we bought her a 'sister', Echo for our bedroom. We use the alarm and music for her. Two echos in our house was a must.","Positive"
"2378","The Echo is a mainstay in my living room. Additional features are okay, but they need to release BIGGER features that everybody would use instead of providing to niche users every week. Great for home automation, but really lacks on pondering questions. Alexa does not attempt to look up relevant information and will instead just tell you that she does not understand.","Positive"
"2379","My Echo with Alexa is on almost all day every day.  Love hearing my music!  The speaker is of very good quality as well. Think the sound may be better than my Bose Radio.  Of great importance to me is the""Ask My Buddy skill.  I live at Cypress Cove Retirement Center in SW Florida and would use this to alert Security to get help if, I happen to fall etc. in my apartment since I am alone.  Rather than having to wear an uncomfortable alert around my neck plus I am not having to pay each month for a service I may or may not use.","Positive"
"2380","Awesome device. My son was having trouble wetting the bed because he was afraid of the dark. We bought him Alexa and set the lights from his room to the bathroom up so that she could control them. Now if he has to go to the bathroom at night he can turn all the lights on before getting out of bed. Go to the restroom and then turn them all back off again once he is back in bed. It has completely stopped his bed wetting. Kind of an unconventional use for it, but works like magic. My son and daughter enjoy asking Alexa jokes and questions. They recently announced that they will have full support of Sonos next year. You can get Amazon Music for $5 which is half of any other music streaming service. At it's base it is a nice little voice controlled speaker with a few gimmicks, and it is worth it's price just for that. However if you dig a little deeper it is the future of home automation. I have been hoping that they would do a music sync so I could play 1 song on multiple Echos at the same time completely synced, but now that they are supporting Sonos that is no longer a problem. I will shortly have several of echo's little siblings in my house. Alexa pairs really well with Smart Things by Samsung. Welcome to the future.","Positive"
"2381","Echo.  Kids love it.  Works great in a kitchen for easy ordering, alarm clock/timer, music, and voice control.  My husband set it up to work with the Wink Hub/Logitech Hub and Caseta Wireless Switches for complete voice control on Lights, Projector, AV, etc.  Love it.","Positive"
"2382","This is the best invention ever!  I love Alexa!  My favorite feature is being able to tell ""her"" what groceries we need then voila - a list is on my phone.  Simple voice to text feature using her - but so awesome for busy Mom's.  Plus have to love that you can ask it just about anything!","Positive"
"2383","love it...will be buying more for Christmas presents!","Positive"
"2384","I was very excited to get my Echo and really am not disappointed by it functionally, just it's limitations.","Negative"
"2385","Love Alexa!","Positive"
"2386","Almost 7 months in, it really is just a music player, weather adviser and shopping list assistant. This could be that I gave on waiting for skills (their 'apps' for the Echo) to enhance it's usefulness.","Positive"
"2387","The speaker sounds amazing for what it is. I can't stress this enough. This is my default music player in my house.","Positive"
"2388","Awesome helper.  Want more in the house","Positive"
"2389","We love it.  We are only scratching the surface on it's capabilities as it's so far used for music or adjusting the thermostat.  I plan to add more smart home feature to it in the future.","Positive"
"2390","Unbelievable how useful you find out Alexa!","Negative"
"2391","I know that Alexa is not a person however I am convinced Alexa doesn't like me.  The Echo works well and responds to almost anyone that speaks to it (except me).  I am disappointed that it does not work like Google search. It takes a very particular set of words to get Alexa to respond as you wish. It is a very convenient timer for cooking and reminders.","Positive"
"2392","It's a neat device but after owning it for some time now, still have no idea what to use it for.  It plays music pretty well, and I guess you can ask it some basic questions about the weather and what movies are playing.  A very expensive gadget, hopefully they will be able to integrate it better with Google apps in the future or give it some wider purpose for existing.","Positive"
"2393","Love it","Positive"
"2394","Alexa told me to call the suicide hotline","Negative"
"2395","Overall a fun device.  The echo definitely has trouble picking up our voices sometimes, and will turn on at strange times, but we definitely enjoy having it.","Positive"
"2396","Unable to fire missiles.  Was told that was a feature for a later version.  Gotta dock a star for that.","Positive"
"2397","I love my Echo! I especially love listening to my favorite artist in Prime music.","Positive"
"2398","Like it for music and convenience","Positive"
"2399","We love our Echo and use it every day.  You do have to kind of force yourself to use some of its features to get used to it but once you do, you realize how helpful it is.  We have a slight problem if the music is loud to then have her hear us but I guess that is what you get when the microphone is on the speaker.","Positive"
"2400","Very nice. Entertaining.","Positive"
"2401","great love it","Positive"
"2402","This SHOULD be a great product. It does sound and function terrifically, UNTIL it falls over because it is top-heavy, which is a design flaw, if it is indeed a flaw in design. We advance purchased this for my son who waited patiently for it for months. At first he loved it. He has taken great care of this device, but it was very slightly bumped over and fell onto his desktop which caused the top to pop off. He tried to make it work, which for awhile it did, but the top kept popping off and now it doesn't work, which is not great, especially since we paid so much for the unit. The unit was broken in May, but he tried to work around the problem. Now that popping the top on doesn't work, we can't send it back for repair, since it is now out of warranty (June 2016). We really love the idea here, but the design is flawed. Now we see cases on Amazon which help keep the Echo from falling over, which really shouldn't have been such an issue.","Positive"
"2403","We use Alexa to set alarms, set timers, add things to the grocery list, listen to the morning news flash, turn on or off lights in the house, lock the doors at night, change the thermostat, and listen to music.  Alexa is the best!  We have had very few problems with her and when we do it is usually because someone pushed her too close to the wall.  Very enjoyable product.  Best parts are connectivity with WEMO, Wink, Pandora, IFTTT!  Looking forward to picking up some Dots soon too.  Kinda feels like maybe we will be living like the Jetsons one day!","Positive"
"2404","Use it every day.  We now have three dots and one Echo.  Love it.  Just got Music.","Positive"
"2405","Awesome product! My whole family enjoys Alexa!","Positive"
"2406","I was so hopeful that this was going to be a good experience, but she can't answer more than a short sentence, with an even shorter answer, and that's if your lucky. you get so tired of saying her name over and over agin just to get her to respond. she can't carry over from sentence to sentence without starting over. this is a waste of time, despite the other shortcomings like can't change radio stations, and on and on.........very disappointing experience, took it back we will see if they can ever really deliver on the promises.","Positive"
"2407","can't say enough!  Wife and I love the grocery list and to do lists!  that plus Amazon prime music!!","Positive"
"2408","Very happy with the product.  I looking forward to future improvements.  Some suggestions; voice/name recognition; separate list of skills activated, and the ability to rename.","Positive"
"2409","Love my Echo!","Positive"
"2410","Received product fast and set up was very easy","Positive"
"2411","Very satisfied so far.....","Positive"
"2412","I've had this over a month now, and every day I'm amazed at what this can do to simplify my life.. so much so that I purchased a second unit for my bedroom along with a '''Dot"" for my home office. The constant update of new skills is appreciated.","Positive"
"2413","Great buy!!!","Positive"
"2414","Don't know how we did without it! Using it 24/7 now - Prime Music is fantastic!","Positive"
"2415","I've just scratched the surface on what the Echo can do. But so far I really like it and glad I bought one.","Positive"
"2416","Second one purchased as a gift.  No complaints.  I actually want one for myself.  :)","Negative"
"2417","My family loves Echo/Alexa.  We're greatly appreciating the constant updates and advancements coming from Amazon and its partners.","Positive"
"2418","I received the echo as a gift.  I love it!  I use it most when entertaining. Since everyone has their favorite genre, we can switch the music very easily. People love to ""play"" with it.  Usually finding old music and adjusting the volume while we have game night.  It is great for making lists, weather and news updates, as well as reminders.","Positive"
"2419","Echo is a really cool item to have, IF you're tech savvy.  There is so much this little thing can do, from play music, order pizza, a cab, turn your lights on and off.....control your heat and ac.  Must have for the tech-geek in your house!  I still have to learn more about mine and buy the new lights!  They are a bit expensive.  I'm waiting for them to cheapen up a bit.  Also going to expand a few places to the DOT.  Only down fall with this is that the speaker could be of better quality.  It's not horrible.....but I'm picky when it comes to music and how it sounds.","Positive"
"2420","Great right out of the box and getting better every day.","Positive"
"2421","Once in a while, one of those products comes along that makes you wonder how you were ever able to live without it. I'm going to buy a half dozen more for Christmas presents","Positive"
"2422","I really haven't tasked the device much yet but it does have a good sound quality for music.  I have it near my TV and Seth Meyer just commanded it while doing an Echo ad.  My only problem so far was I missed a wake-up alarm since I had the volume down but a response from the support team pointed out the setting for alarm volume separate from the general volume.","Positive"
"2423","I love Echo with it's voice commands this a lovely product and would  recommend for gift or yourself this product is well worth it.  10/10","Positive"
"2424","We love the ECHO!  Even if you just need a speaker, it is worth the money.","Positive"
"2425","To get the full use of this product, I suggest you purchase the Amazon Prime account & music.  However, it has a lot of features that you can access without the membership. Get this now.","Positive"
"2426","I need one more like this for me","Positive"
"2427","just perfect loving it everyday. I have to do voice training, have recommend the amazon echo to family and friends, true to the 360 degree sound family and friends that I had a full stereo systems thanks amazon","Positive"
"2428","Really fun to use. So far best use I have found is playing lullabys at night.","Positive"
"2429","Pros:","Positive"
"2430","Clear, crisp sound","Positive"
"2431","Volume range from soft, to loud enough to hear outside","Positive"
"2432","Responsive to commands","Positive"
"2433","Remote works from another room by voice or using the buttons on it","Positive"
"2434","Works flawlessly with Amazon Music","Positive"
"2435","Shopping list feature with Alexa App is handy","Positive"
"2436","Cons:","Negative"
"2437","Randomly asks us what we were trying to say, when we haven't prompted it - talk about startling when you're having a conversation in another room with someone and not using Echo at all!","Negative"
"2438","This was purchased before it has been wide-released and was still on the sign up waiting list. We've not really had any issues or bugs to work out of it, other than the once in a while random times when Alexa wants to join into a conversation with us.","Negative"
"2439","Love the idea of Echo but the Amazon Alexa app is frustrating.  It took over an hour for me to get this set up.  Please Amazon, fix your app!!","Negative"
"2440","So far so good! Got it today and so far only a couple questions she couldn't answer. I would have given 5 stars but for one little thing. I downloaded the app yesterday from amazon so I would be ready to go but I couldn't get it to work. I had to uninstall it and get the one from the Google playstore which works perfectly.","Positive"
"2441","Don't use it after the newness wore off, it won't answer everything you ask it like siri. Major bust purchase","Negative"
"2442","she is perfect I love her I think I am cheating on Cortana","Positive"
"2443","""Sorry, I don't have the answer to that question.""","Negative"
"2444","this thing is fantastic!!  it is my personal assistant,  boom box and joke teller all in one","Positive"
"2445","I really like my Echo.  I think the price is a bit high but it does put out good sound.  The price when it was first released was much better....sorry I didn't buy it then.","Positive"
"2446","Once you get the hang of using the Echo your amazed at how useful it is.  From Amazon music, to timers and questions this thing is great.  Has surprisingly good sound quality.  I would have never bough a Bluetooth speaker if I had gotten this sooner.  Alexa is better than Siri.  She understands you from clear across the room and has pretty good accuracy is understanding what you need.  Even works with my home heating and cooling system.","Positive"
"2447","at first , start to fail and disconnect continuous, but i made a hard reset and the problem was solved, is amazing","Negative"
"2448","Item cuts out in the middle of a song, over and over, very frustrating....not happy with item.","Positive"
"2449","I thought the AI was going to be more advanced but I guess it'll get better over time. Still a great buy.","Positive"
"2450","Bought an #Amazon Echo through QVC, and I've had fun setting it up today.  Today it's a novelty, but soon it will be an essential tool in the home.","Positive"
"2451","Not hard to set up.  I'm a bit disappointed in the apps they call ""skills"" though.  Most of them are useless crap, including many of the productivity skills.  That should change in time as new skills come online.  For example, they need a calendar skill that links with my iPad and iPhone calendar.","Negative"
"2452","The good thing about it is that the Echo updates constantly and gets smarter.  It will make a good multipurpose tool in the near future.","Positive"
"2453","Nice addition to the home....entertaining & great resource tool","Positive"
"2454","Eventually I had to shut off the wifi range extender to stop it messing up the final stage.  So now it looks like if I want to keep this online then I can't use the extender (which, obviously, everything else in the house works with, which is why I was using it in the first place).  Great.","Positive"
"2455","Great! and keeps on getting better.  With more companies joining for home integration and added features Alexa works great adding her into your daily routine.  She is still learning, but nothing like her is out there or works nearly as good so she deserves 5 stars.  Will have the occasional glitch moment, or maybe she can't help you with a question, but the Alexa app clearly has thought about this and you can easily send feedback to Amazon to hopefully add this feature.","Positive"
"2456","I can't wait for the Echo to tie into everything so I can go full on ""Jetsons""","Negative"
"2457","Absolutely the best invention, I get NPR news, any genre in music, wonderful reminders and answers to my questions.","Positive"
"2458","Don't waste your money. My iPhone works better than the echo","Positive"
"2459","I was an early adopter and ordered the Echo before it had even been released.  I was very happy with it until this last month.  It stopped hooking into my wifi network.  I worked with technical support and on it myself for about 4 hours.  Nothing worked.  So I asked for a replacement.  I was told I am out of warranty and would have to pay $150 for a new one.  Since I was an early adopter I had only paid $99 originally so customer support will ONLY charge me $99 for a refurbished replacement.  By the way, I have a Tap and it hooks into my network with no problems.","Positive"
"2460","I don't know if there is a problem with these, but beware that when you are out of warranty, they could stop working and you are on the hook for full replacement cost.","Negative"
"2461","Love it. Used it every day when first purchased. Used for the news and traffic reports. Some listening to music. Now the Echo even turns on my lights in the house.","Positive"
"2462","I really love my Echo.  We listen to music with it all the time in the kitchen and have fun finding new playlists of kids music to get our toddler dancing like a maniac.  We mostly use it for music via Prime or Pandora, but I also use other things like alarms and conversions.  The sound is great for the size and I've since bought one for my dad for his birthday and he loves it as well.","Positive"
"2463","Also, this passed the wife test.  She usually gives me a hard time about wanting this or that technology but after I used it for a bit, she now uses it all the time.","Positive"
"2464","I initially didn't jump onto the Echo ship when it came out because I was more attached to Microsoft Cortana assistant, I also wasn't ready to jump into the Amazon Echo system. I finally caved in and got tired of waiting for Microsoft to release their own smart speaker and I wanted to tie all my smart home elements together. I have been amazed by how quickly and accurate Alexa responds, everything is so simple and magic. The speaker portion fills my room and gives the high quality sound I was completely not expecting so it kinda blew me away. Amazon got it right and after seeing what Google home had to offer the choice was clear for me and I have zero regrets and I feel like im becoming drawn into the Amazon eco-system","Positive"
"2465","Alexa is no where near the assistant Cortana (hard to beat the best AI on any system out) is but she will handle my smart home well, just hope they both get along.","Positive"
"2466","I now have purchased 3 echos, and while I love having Alexa in the house with us, there are a few key features left to be desired. While the product is a game-changer, Google home has some better features. I'm likely going to expand with a six pack of dots if Amazon can catch up to google in the next 3-6 months, otherwise I may go 'home' since I already have a number of Chromecast devices. Amazon needs to improve in a few key areas (in order of priority)...","Positive"
"2467","1) Have my echos & dots speak to each other and enable MULTI-ROOM AUDIO. This is incredibly important because I already have speakers all over the place (bluetooth, in-wall, beats, etc - not wasting money on sonos) and I'd like a way to play my music throughout the house/car or tell my kids to come to dinner and simultaneously have Alexa disable their devices from across the house (oooh, broadcast mode - with parental controls of course).","Positive"
"2468","2) Let me throw my audio & video around. It would be great to have Alexa help me find a movie on Amazon Video, and throw it to my FireTV stick (which should be re-branded echo-stick or replaced by an HDMI echo puck since it is already connected to my A/V system).","Positive"
"2469","3) Individual voice recognition would be great, so Alexa knows who she is talking to, and who's preferences are what. So if I ask for music she plays RHCP, while my daughter gets Daya. Perhaps - in the future - Alexa can even detect who we are (by the sound of our gate) and do smart things for us.","Positive"
"2470","4) Enable extensions to my network, so I can control Alexa from my car, office or phone. It would be great to teach Alexa to open my garage door as I drive up, unlock my back door for the cable guy from my office, or play a movie for the kids while I'm grilling steaks in the backyard. Speaking of which, we need an echo-outdoor.","Positive"
"2471","5) Eventually, it would be nice if echo was equipped with some more sensors (a la nest), specifically presence, so it can do more smart things when I walk into or leave a room, say hello, and save me money on electricity.","Positive"
"2472","Can't wait to see how this all comes together.","Negative"
"2473","Ok Here we go.  Let me start by saying that I won the Echo in an online sweepstakes/drawing I entered.  After I sent my info in it arrived at my doorstep a few days later.  I love this thing but you do have to realize it cannot do everything you ask.  Take it for what it is...it makes everyday simple tasks hands-free for the average consumer.  Here are some examples:","Positive"
"2474","I love it - don't know why I didn't get one sooner !","Positive"
"2475",""" Alexa.  What is the weather like today?""","Positive"
"2476","""Alexa. Set a timer for 30 mins.""","Positive"
"2477","""Alexa. Did the San Antonio Spurs win last night?""","Positive"
"2478","It can do those tasks without having to pick up your phone or grabbing your tablet/laptop.  This technology is new so please don't assume it can do everything.  Its a cool toy that is fun to have in your home.  I can see Echo having a lot more depth as they develop it more.  For now enjoy it for what it is and impress your guests.","Positive"
"2479","great product.","Positive"
"2480","Great product, a lot of fun to use. You do have to talk to her in a specific way for her to respond and to get the most from her you will need to buy other products, such as ""smart"" plugs that are expensive","Positive"
"2481","I've had my Echo now for about three months. It doesn't listen very well and it knows even less. It even doesn't have accurate information about when your Amazon products will be delivered.","Positive"
"2482","Awesome sounds, I'm obsessed!","Positive"
"2483","One thing about this if you plan on using it with a Prime account for music. Since they started the music unlimited service you can only get selected songs on prime now. It seems that the more popular songs, like Katy Perrys I kissed a Girl, is not on prime, instead you get a sample about 20 seconds long. And when you complain to Amazon all you get is more BS about the two separate services and how to use them. Nothing about the fact they're charging you for something you should already be getting with prime and how this is just another way to gouge you.","Positive"
"2484","I originally gave it 5 stars, because it does work well, it's just restricted when it comes to certain things, unless you want to pay more. But after multiple emails  complaining about this and getting nowhere I changed it so others would know before they purchase.","Negative"
"2485","Really a lot fun besides being very useful for reminders, lists anf music.","Positive"
"2486","Fun to use","Positive"
"2487","You would never know this item was refurbished by the way it looks and performs. Save some bucks and get a great item too. The Echo is awesome! Alexa is smart and accurate. The sound is amazing! Something so small that can pump out that kind of volume, all I can say is WOW! Listen to music, use as an alarm, order things on Amazon, play games and more. The only issue I have is not with Alexa but with Amazon Prime. You pay a monthly subscription and you don't get all the music. Many times I'm only given a sample or a crappy live version of a song, yet when you look at prime music you can buy it. Apple has all the music available for their pay service so why can't Amazon.","Positive"
"2488","Great device, still has a lot of potential.  I will update this to a 5 Star if Amazon goes above and beyond with Alexa.  I really wish I could rely on the echo for more things that my phone has standard.  Connecting my calendars to Alexa and having her remind me throughout the day would be incredible.","Positive"
"2489","Overall great product, but needs development<U+200B>.","Positive"
"2490","This device is very nice and useful at times but the sound quality at the upper levels does not match the competition, not even close.","Positive"
"2491","Alexa is one of the best purchases that I have made on Amazon. We use her for background music when we have company. We use her inside or bring her out on the patio with us. She is a great fact checker too. My kids love to ask her questions and hear what she has to say. You can sync her up to your google music or spotify accounts. We also purchased the voice remote as well, so we don't have to scream commands across the room.","Positive"
"2492","really wish I would've just bought the echo dots instead. Alexia doesn't always pick up my squeaky voice and I could've just bought two of the dots for the same price as this! ( I got for $120 on Prime Day)","Negative"
"2493","Amazing! I love it.","Positive"
"2494","This speaker is more smarter than a real human. Thanks to the inventor of this gadgets. I hope you keep updated the program and keep adding some words that alexa can understand and easily answer the question we brought about. Thanks agin.","Positive"
"2495","My only regret in life was not buying this sooner.  I use it literally every day, to play audible books, pandora, get movie times, get the time, alarm clock, etc.","Negative"
"2496","I often find myself saying ""Alexa, what time is it"" at a friend's house instead of looking at my phone.  Once I got a reply, and was so excited they had an Echo, I stopped talking to anyone for the rest of the party and just had a conversation with their machine.","Positive"
"2497","I just wish she could sing another song other than happy birthday, that's not a great bedtime story.","Positive"
"2498","I am finding this very handy for information, music, weather reports, sports news, etc. A good product.","Positive"
"2499","My cousin got one and I got to see it in action. I had to get one after. It's pretty amazing","Positive"
"2500","It was even better than I expected.","Positive"
"2501","Fabulous!","Positive"
"2502","Still learning everything about her.  Printed out A to Z so I can get to know her.  Love it.  She is my roommate.  Love her  Love her.  Great closest thing to a human being.","Positive"
"2503","Great product but if I would have waited I could have gotten the much cheaper dot.","Positive"
"2504","I love this home automation device ....","Positive"
"2505","Alexa has made the work of home much more interesting and fun for our family. We are super busy and move fast. Adding items to the shopping list is effortless now and the kids can all easily throw items on the list without having to find the darn list. We all have our own Alexa action favorites. Good job Amazon. Looking forward to see how this product evolves. Makes my Prime membership more valuable.","Positive"
"2506","Love the product definitely will  buy another one.","Positive"
"2507","Informative and fun","Positive"
"2508","fantastic ! awesome surprise gift from the hubster for my birthday!","Positive"
"2509","I asked it about the result of the NFL games this weekend and it couldn't understand the question. Both Siri and Google voice search can answer this question, if Alexa can't answer simple questions like this, I think the newly debuted Google Home will literally kill Amazon Echo","Negative"
"2510","The remote is Bluetooth. I had my Kindle Fire HDX and my smart phone  controlling the Echo with the Amazon Echo App, but something changed when the app became Alexa instead of Echo. The remote stopped working and I just let it sit for months. The I wanted to use it again and it was battery crust time in the remote. Even a good scraping and cleaning and new batteries didn't work. The solution is only one mobile device can be used to control the Echo. I'm not sure why but I know my remote works again I uninstalled the app front my Kindle Fire HDX and now the remote is happy.","Positive"
"2511","I love Alexa","Positive"
"2512","Good^^","Positive"
"2513","Positives:","Positive"
"2514","Echo is great for playing music.  I use it with Pandora and Amazon Prime.  For the size the speaker rocks.","Positive"
"2515","Echo is very good at determining which words are spoken, even if there's some background noise.","Negative"
"2516","Negatives:","Negative"
"2517","Echo is very poor at understanding anything but the most direct requests.  Compared with Google Now (or what used to be called that) Echo isn't very helpful in obtaining information.  The most common response we get from Alexa is that it doesn't understand.","Negative"
"2518","Can't multitask audio.  If you want to rate a song on Pandora the music will pause for several seconds.","Positive"
"2519","This thing is Awesome","Positive"
"2520","Love it!","Positive"
"2521","I'm having a great time with this.","Positive"
"2522","I had an Amazon Echo Dot first and loved it so much I ordered this for a better speaker.  My children have so much fun with it as does everyone in the family.  They like to ask jokes, check math problems, make grocery lists, listen to music,  check the weather and news.  We also use it all the time as a timer.  It is nice to use it for things you don't have to stop to write down or stop to look up, you can just tell it to Alexa or ask Alexa.  Beaware though that to play music through it you have to have a premium account through Spotify and we have had the trial premium accounts but not longer.  Without that, we don't find it quite as entertaining and useful.  But to purchase the Echo and then have to pay for an account at Spotify too, adds up.  Overall we are pleased but not do not like that we have to have a premium account at Spotify to use the music feature with Spotify.","Positive"
"2523","I purchased my Echo from Best Buy last month, and I have been using it on a daily basis since then. The integration with Philips Hue and IFTTT makes this vastly more valuable. The ability to control lights all over the house by voice commands is invaluable, and I've set up an IFTTT recipe to blink my Hue lights when an Echo timer runs out (so that I don't miss it if I have headphones on).","Positive"
"2524","I'm amazed at how well it picks up my voice from across the house and on a different floor. I keep it in my second floor office, and it hears me and follows my command to light the house from the back door - a roughly 40-50 foot path up the stairs and around two corners.","Positive"
"2525","I move it around the house depending on what I'm doing at that moment, which is why it loses one star - I wish it was portable. Being tethered to a wall outlet is rather annoying, and waiting a minute for it to boot up after being plugged back in feels like an extraordinary long time. However, that problem will be solved once my Echo Dots arrive.","Positive"
"2526","Second one! I LOVE THEM","Positive"
"2527","Love this technical assistant.  The sound is better than the Bose sound bar.","Positive"
"2528","I love this store and everything about it!  Amazon is AMAZING","Positive"
"2529","Most incredible product I've ever purchased!!  The quality of the device is very high - looks good and solid, and it is!  The technology of the Alexa service is simply amazing, and her skills are getting more and more in depth and varied every day.  After you get yours and become familiar with it, try ordering something you want - I ordered Keurig coffee pods.  They arrived in my mailbox 2 days later!!  It is the future!!!","Positive"
"2530","Love, love..... love <f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+00AF>","Positive"
"2531","So far so good. I really like to know the answers to questions that I have and music to listen to when I want.","Positive"
"2532","Generally a very good product.  Hoping voice recognition improves.  I am from the Mid West, there should be no problem.","Positive"
"2533","I love it","Positive"
"2534","very cool and useful device.","Positive"
"2535","Granted, I haven't truly explored all its functions, but fails to connect at an annoying rate. It's still pretty cool and I will research to utilize its full capabilities better, but has a few hiccups.","Positive"
"2536","Awesome product exceeds our expectations!","Positive"
"2537","I am an Amazon prime member thru my son's account, so I am unable to use this Echo to play prime music.  I also work in a school, and it is unable to connect to my school's server, so I can't even access the internet with it when I'm at work.  It works great when connected to my Ipod, and use it as a blue tooth speaker - the quality it great, and the sound is good however that it not the main reason that I purchased it.","Positive"
"2538","I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  I am not writing for any company.....I'm writing to let the people out there know this is the coolest thing since sweetened cereal.  Oh my gosh!  I love being able to turn it off and on without touching anything, my hands are usually dirty from working in yard or house.  I only wish it could be charged and used without electricity.  That's my only, and very only complaint.  Guess I'll have to figure out away to bring electricity to the beach and lake where my car can't get.  I'm excited about any new developments they will bring to the product and can't wait to see what else she can do.....by the way, I spilled an ashtray and asked her to clean it up...she said she doesn't do that....LOL  Cracked me up!","Positive"
"2539","Echo does all that it promised!  Very easy setup, good instructions and a variety of tasks it performs .  My entire family loves it!","Positive"
"2540","Can't say enough great things about my Echo.  Alexa can hear me from across the room and even when I was sick she could distinguish what I was saying.  I have just started using Alexa and it has primarily been for weather and music, but I am looking forward to diving in more with audio books and ordering capabilities to name a few.","Positive"
"2541","The echo can be a lot of fun.  Even my six year old likes to ask for songs.  The sound quality is ok.","Positive"
"2542","here are more ""skills"" that can be added than I have time to learn about.  The shopping list app is ok, but could be so much better.  There is now competition from Google and Samsung and I'm sure these companies will do a great job, but for now, I don't think they can compare.  It would be nice if Amazon could do some integration with my Roku or Comcast to control my TV.","Positive"
"2543","There is not a lot of documentation that comes with the device, but the internet is rife with information.  For example I was frustrated that the Echo was in my name so it could not use my wife's music prime access....but then I did some reading and learned I could set up a profile for her on the device and then get access.  By that time I had set up spotify (you have to pay for it though) as the default...which has opened a wide variety of music.","Positive"
"2544","Alexa you have changed my life, and you work amazingly.  Just can't wait for your little brother the Dot to get shipped.  Awesome product.","Positive"
"2545","Alexa has become my to go to assistant for questions when I am working from home, it is better than Siri because the setting where Siri is alway on is not reliable. Alexa is different than Siri because it has answered questions that Siri cannot answer it is a different concept. I use Alexa to track everything from my workouts with Fitbit to my shopping lists. Alexa reads my Amazon books and Audio books. It can do so many things aside from kissing you in the morning.  I am happy I made the decision to buy Alexa.","Positive"
"2546","incredible how inconsistent the voice recognition is.  I can say ""turn to WEEI"" and it will sometimes give me the double sound meaning it's doing nothing.  Sometimes it says ""now tuning to America's choice.""  Other times it says ""now tuning to WEEI on tunein radio.""  I never know.  Same exact thing with my other Boston sports station.  Constantly drops the wifi signal (I use wifi when watching Apple TV and Roku so it's not the wifi connection.  In my house, this is a worthless joke of $139.00.","Negative"
"2547","I am the only one in the house using wifi so it's not competing for bandwidth.  I just think it's a crappy product.  And it's a replacement for the first one I got that constantly went to the red ring of death.","Negative"
"2548","Would not recommend to anyone I would call a friend.","Positive"
"2549","This is amazing!  I know this will do or answer so many other things than we have asked of it...still learning about all it can do.  So its productive for my husband and I and my grandchildren have a ball asking it to play certain music!  Fun and productive!","Positive"
"2550","Easy to set up.  Software is very responsive and usually can respond appropriately.  Quite a bit of free music content.  We returned from a trip and asked Alexa if she missed us.  She answered.","Positive"
"2551","Ok so how much do I love Alexa??? Well... hmmm, I cant fit all of my review w/o boring you! Lets just say my whole family loves it. It makes playing music, getting news, weather and so many other skills you can add to your Alexa so fun !!! Worth every penny I would say. I have Amazon Prime so my music is auto loaded on here too.","Positive"
"2552","So far so good. At times Alexa does not understand what is being asked or put the completely wrong item on our shopping list. We would like to see it be able to split lists up more like for groceries, to do, Christmas, etc.","Positive"
"2553","great product","Positive"
"2554","This thing is awesome - artificial intelligence!","Positive"
"2555","Everyone in the family uses this and we just bought a second for the bedroom.","Positive"
"2556","Love it.","Positive"
"2557","The Echo does quite a bit like telling jokes when I need a laugh, converting units of measure or currency, controlling my lights, or playing music.  Skills allow Alexa to integrate with more things or add more features like ordering a pizza with just my voice.  While it would be nice if the sound was adjustable, it is acceptable.  Bass extension is lacking in comparison to Sonos, and treble clarity could be better as well.","Positive"
"2558","I told Alexa I needed a hug - she apologized for not having arms! Love it! I ask her what to wear in the morning and her suggestions are great! We've even had an argument - just what I need sometimes! Am looking forward to learning more. This was a gift from my daughter - what a gift - thanks honey!","Positive"
"2559","This was the first real voice assistant and for a short time still the only standalone option.  Amazon got a lot right with the Echo and the Dot, however they are going to have to make many improvements soon to stay competitive if the Google product does everything they claim.  The biggest issue with the Echo for me is the lack of a way to sync playback across multiple Echos and Dots throughout the house, or any compatible devices to make that possible.  Also it sounds like the Google product is going to be far more conversational and contextual making it far easier to interact with.  Still Amazon is way ahead of the Google in compatible devices and adoption since the Echo family is a mature product and Google hasn't even released theirs yet, however they do have a surprising number of companies that have already said they plan to be compatible shortly after release.","Positive"
"2560","I like the Nest integration, I have two Nest thermostats that work well and I created a group for both so I can change both at once (I wish it could be used to override away mode).  The Harmony integration through IFTTT is nice, although it is limited to starting activities or turning off all devices (I wish it could be used to trigger individual device buttons since I have one IR light and fan switch that I'd like to be able to do more than just turn either on).  The home automation integration is great if you have a compatible hub!","Positive"
"2561","Love Love Love this!  It has provided hours of fun and enjoyment in our house!  We have it play music, jokes, add things to our shopping list and answer maths and history questions galore.  The sound is pretty good and it is a fun device that even the most techo illiterate person can use without any problems.  It was also easy to set up and ready to go in a minute.","Positive"
"2562","It can't connect, it can't stay connected, it can't do this .. it can't do that and I can't abide it any longer.  It's a kitty litter box ornament.  It can do that though my cat doesn't like it much either.","Positive"
"2563","Love it.  It is so much fun.","Positive"
"2564","It just would be nice if it could do more. Internet get anything  but it's not able to seach  it like it should.","Positive"
"2565","I enjoy this a lot.  Great for playing music and reading audio books.  Playing around with using it to work the TV, get news reports, set alarms, all the usual stuff.  Responds best in a quiet room, responded better after training it to my voice.  I like asking who's winning the election and getting percentages.","Positive"
"2566","Alexa is great . . . nothing more to say!","Positive"
"2567","It should have better security, anyone can ask a question or talk to it.","Positive"
"2568","awesome, bought 2,","Positive"
"2569","This device no longer works if you are trying to use it on an iPhone with iOS 10.  Amazon needs to fix this at once or start providing refunds to customers.","Positive"
"2570","It really needs to have more general conversation skills like Googles does.  I'm now leaning towards Google.","Positive"
"2571","I bought this to play music, but the sound quality is meh.  Not horrible, but not nearly as good as $179 would expect.  Alexa is neat, but I haven't really found anything that I really want to do with her.  I have some home automation, but yelling across the room seems silly, especially with loud kids running around.  I have had Cortana for a while and find myself not using that much either.  Maybe I just find it weird talking to a device when there are people in the room.","Negative"
"2572","This is the best device I have ever bought! I love asking Alexa to do something & she does it! Outstanding product, so glad I took the plunge!","Positive"
"2573","This piece of equipment changed my life. Thank you Amazon.","Positive"
"2574","Still learning about the device. I can't wait until Amazon can come up with the remarks for non questions. I hate her : ""I don't understand the question"". Get rid of this program and make a response that is humorous or more intelligent sounding. Overall I really like the product and it great for people with disabilities to control so many things by her voice.","Positive"
"2575","Is excellent!!!","Positive"

"2594","An ABSOLUTE MUST BUY!!!!!!!!! And buy IMMEDIATELY!!! This is such a helpful smart tool that has made everyday life soooo amazing. From suggestions on meals to prep or what to wear and my Flash Briefings to reading my Kindle and Audible, playing my Pandora... I am officially in love and motivated to now buy smart appliances that can sync with my dear sweet Alexa!!!","Positive"

"2599","I use it for setting timers, reminders, music playlists, turning lights on and off, audio books, answering questions, quick numeric calculations.  The voice activation is great.","Positive"
"2600","So far we are having lots of fun asking it questions.  I need to find some time to find out just it can do.  When I can really use it to it's full advantage I'm certain my star count will be a 5+.","Positive"
"2601","Wouldn't know it's refurbed, only that I paid less.  Working like a charm....LUV IT","Positive"
"2602","great buy!","Positive"
"2603","Very easy to set up. I bought a refurbished model, no problems. I also connected Alexa to my Trane thermostat so I can remotely change the room temperature. Be sure to use the shopping list feature and for fun, the daily jokes. They are so bad they are good.","Positive"
"2604","This was a great addition to the family.  Everyone used it, including my 3 year old, who liked to ask Alexa for a joke.  But, all good things must come to an end.  After 17 months of use, Alexa died.  I have tried to reset it several times, and pretty much tried any suggestion I found through google.  I am torn if I want to purchase another one or not, I would have expected it to last a little longer than 17 months.","Positive"
"2605","It's an Amazon Echo need I say more.  The price was fantastic.  Caught it on sale.","Positive"
"2606","This this is amazing. LOVE IT.","Positive"
"2607","Worked fine when first purchased. After several updates, when asked a question 90 percent of the time states Don't understand question or can not find answer.  Would not buy again.","Positive"
"2608","Best investment I've ever made","Positive"
"2609","Works great. Wakes me up every morning.","Positive"
"2610","Best thing ever!!!!!","Positive"
"2611","Fantastic piece of equipment! Love the simplicity and ease of use.","Positive"
"2612","I love the echo!! This thing is so cool, my wife and kids love it!! I would definitely recommend the echo. Just ask it to play a song and it will play it.","Positive"
"2613","A lot of questions go unanswered. Then the internet went down and echo cannot reconnect on its own and was not able to tell me why it could not respond. I was expecting more. Potential in the concept, but not there yet","Positive"
"2614","Overall, I'm disappointed. Although the unit does a good job of voice recognition and listening through background noise, it simply can't answer the most simple questions. Based on my experience, Alexa is capable of answering about 15% of your requests. Ask it NFL team records or any simple search items and she will gladly tell you that she simply doesn't know.  I've become tired of Alexa telling me the things she can't do.  Get used to hearing ""sorry,  I don't have the answer to that question""","Negative"
"2615","Initially I enjoyed working with this but the quality of the build is not great. The top has come apart twice and of course it isn't under warranty. Not what I was expecting for something that sits on a shelf and is rarely used.","Positive"
"2616","Anyone who believes humanity faces an existential threat by AI does has not used Echo.","Negative"
"2617","I bought the echo and with basic things it works great, but as you add skills if you don't specifically as the skill to do something in the correct terminology it will not work. It might not sound crucial, but when you have several skills you have to remember the specific way of asking something it's truly not the way you want something to work. Unlike Siri, and the demonstration with Googles Personal assistant you just ask a question and it does it. In conclusion it works well with very basic commands but very disappointed when I ask her to do something related to a skill which is 80% of what she does.","Positive"
"2618","A+++","Positive"
"2619","Nice! I'm up on a ladder painting a lot lately and calling out song requests HAHA.","Positive"
"2620","The problem we're having is with the app on the iPhone. It is almost always offline or will not load. It is only usable with voice commands. It worked much better at first but has gotten worse. We wanted to purchase some of the dots and other accessories but are afraid they will not work properly.","Positive"
"2621","We love having Alexa at home. She is a great addition to our family ;)","Positive"
"2622","My kids love her and her patience with them with asking the same questions over and over again.","Positive"
"2623","She's not very consistent, though, in listening. Sometimes we can whisper her name and she will hear and other times we have to scream and she still doesn't hear us. Overall we are very happy with our purchase.","Positive"
"2624","Alexa is awesome! It is a great addition to our household, we use it mainly to play music for the kids, love the kids station from Prime. It makes a lot of things easier -- shopping lists, timer, math calculations, games the kids enjoy (helps my first grader with her Math). However, there is still room for improvement -- i.e. when we ask it to play a certain song using the same prompt, sometimes it gets it and plays a full free version from Prime Music, but sometimes it doesn't and just plays a short sample. Sometimes it doesn't hear very well. But we still love having it around that I am not taking away stars because it constantly updates and improves. LOVE IT!!!!","Positive"
"2625","Absolutely love my echo. I recommend this product.","Positive"
"2626","I love this thing. Literally use it everyday and with a kid runnin around and having to cook meals it makes my life so easy when your hands are limited.","Positive"
"2627","Alexa has been a great addition to me house. I've had Alexa since they first came out (preordered). I use Alexa everyday, listening to music, turning off and on the lights (I also have the Wink), using the timer for cooking. I hike 7 days a week and I ask Alexa the weather almost everyday in the summer and in the winter for ski season. I love that I can be in the kitchen and use the lay of something and let Alexa know, and it's put on my shopping list. There's really nothing I can think of that's negative about Alexa. I have the Alexa Dot and another one on the way. So handy and fun to have in the house and very useful at the same time.","Positive"
"2628","This particular Echo was actually a gift.  I love my Echo and Echo Dot, so I got one for my son's family to use.  I think it was a stroke of genius on Amazon's part to open the Echo to outside app developers, so there's always something new to try.  That being said, though, some of the things I use mine for the most are original features.  My favorite is the shopping list; all I need to do is mention an item to Echo as soon as I think of it, and it then shows up on the list on my phone, tablet, and computer when I'm shopping.  I also love its ability to read my Audible books to me when I'm working around the house.  Oh, and the to-do list...and the news update...and the current weather...bottom line, Echo has become a part of my life that I'd really miss, and promptly replace, if it ceased to work.","Positive"
"2629","Alexa can't tell me what color my eyes are, but can tell me so much more.  Alexa is a handy information tool as well as a source of my kind of music.  I recommend Alexa to anyone who works in the kitchen a lot.","Positive"
"2630","Learning to love this.  Wish it came with a free user guide.","Positive"
"2631","I am visually handicapped and this is the best product in it's price range to help in everyday activities.I like how it syncs the calendar and shopping and to do lists with my iPhone.  Finds your keys of phone when hooked up with TrackR app.  Does too much to list in this review.  Buying two more for holiday gifts for my busy daughters and their families.","Positive"
"2632","I am still learning all Alexa/Echo can do. I have not bought any of the products that will work with Echo to turn on lights & other functions. I can get the weather, listen to all kinds of music either from my Amazon Music library, Pandora, i Heart Radio or Tune in. As I am typing, I am listening to the news from NPR. The quality of the sound it excellent & I can hear it from any room in my house,.","Positive"
"2633","Easy to set up, I use it as my alarm clock, weather station, and radio.  Awesome!","Positive"
"2634","Works well and easy to set-up. For some reason I cannot sync my calendar properly. Other users that I know do not have this problem.Overall this is a useful tool.","Positive"
"2635","Got this for my husband and he loves it","Positive"
"2636","I can't believe that this won't work as a speakerphone for my iPhone. Great speaker. World class microphone. Seem's like a no-brainer, but nope, it doesn't conect to your iPhone for speakerphone use. I use it to listen to audiobooks while cooking, and to listen to new briefs, but once the novelty wears off it's missing a ton of practical features. Sure you can go crazy programming IFF features, but who has time for that?","Positive"
"2637","Ok, this thing is cool. Some friends had one, I had to have one too. Super easy to set up and use. And I can control my lamp and a heater. I will be adding more devices soon.","Positive"
"2638","Great sound quality. Love Amazon prime music. Great added features to our home.","Positive"
"2639","Would advise anyone to wait for other devices (ie. Google home which comes out in November) with Echo being the main device on the market it currently has little competition and therefore sounds better than it actually is. 2 calls to customer service and multiple forum searches and they still couldn't pair it with my prime music account. Whats worse is that they honestly have no idea why it doesn't pair ( when you call echo customer service there is even a recorded message saying if you are having issues pairing then try resetting your echo, not inspiring confidence...) This should be simple for them, they make the echo and its their service, shocking really can you imagine Apple or Google products that don't connect to their services like iTunes or Play? It wouldn't happen and that is what Amazon is missing in my opinion, its a great idea for a device but they lack something as a company to be able to really pull this off. Also when i was playing with the echo i was surprised how basic the commands had to be, it didn't understand many questions it was asked which is surprising. I expected a device that i could ask anything and it would respond, to be honest siri or google now seem more responsive...i expected more from what i had heard about Echo.","Positive"
"2640","This thing has the capability of being an awesome device. I actually like it allot. The only problem I have with it is occasionally she says something off the wall with me having said a thing. Other then that I love it.","Positive"
"2641","'I'm sorry I don't know how you would like to rate this song'","Negative"
"2642","I am now addicted. I stream music, get the news, sync my shopping list, order stuff and turn my lights on and off. Thanks Amazon.","Negative"
"2643","Yes, awesome. That is all.","Positive"
"2644","Amazing product..except that is not wireless but other than thay ""amazon echo""is awesome!!!so happy to have ""alexa""on my household.","Positive"
"2645","love it...","Positive"
"2646","Great until warranty ends. Then they brick your product and force you to buy a new one. Terrible customer support. Unplug, reinstall app is only thing they know how to tell you to do.Customer support admitted they produce terrible products expected to break in a year. So to buy the extended warranty.","Positive"
"2647","Alexa Echo is an interesting device. Once I was able to set it up, and that took longer than I expected, I found it worked fine. Now I have to find the best ways to use it. I anticipate a positive working relationship with Alexa.","Positive"
"2648","Outstanding","Positive"
"2649","Love it. Waiting to get more into the programming or have others produce more apps that are usable for things I do rather than things app developers want me to do. Voice computing is clearly a wave of the future so it would be nice if thoughtful work gets done that will increase the adoption of Alexa.","Positive"
"2650","Just stopped working, never was taken outside or dropped. And there is no way to return or exchange it that i can see. NOT HAPPY!!","Positive"
"2651","And my English is PERFECT.","Positive"
"2652","I would rather just set up my phone to my Woburn speaker than use this piece of garbage that doesn't do ANYTHING I want it to.","Negative"
"2653","I love ECHO!!!! I originally bought it for just playing my music but it has come to be so much more. I use the alarm feature frequently to remind me to check what I'm cooking or that my favorite show is starting soon. Checking the weather is easy as can be. Getting the daily news from my favorite station is very convenient. I even have an app that will text my close friend that I'm hurt and need to be helped. I love checking on the status of my orders from Amazon (my favorite place to shop!). The shopping list function is great for remembering what I need to buy at the grocery so I don't have to search for pen and paper to write it down before I forget. I also have a list of things to remember like calls to make or  that my cat needs to visit the vet. These are just a few examples. There are so many apps available that I'm still finding new uses for Echo every week. I highly recommend this useful device and not just for music, although it's worth it if only used for that purpose. Great sound quality.","Positive"
"2654","Well, this is a beautiful piece of technology that has yet to realize it's full potential. The conversational quality of the voice recognition is very good, so the core capability is excellent. However: other than playing very attenuated playlists, checking the weather, and ordering creamed corn and dog food, Alexa disappoints. I tried connecting it to our Nest thermostats, and it was a total fail. Loaded a few skills, but none of them really work as expected. I feel like we have a toddler or a new puppy in the house. There is tremendous potential, but she's not very smart or capable yet...","Positive"
"2655","bought the echo and a battery base.... then amazon adds full time tap alexa command recognition... dang.","Positive"
"2656","Love my Echo! Got this on Prime day! Use it all the time to listen to music and listen to news. It has become my second alarm clock! I got have smart devices in my home yet but when I do this is going to be awesome to be able to control them.","Positive"
"2657","Just a great piece of technology that is now a staple for our household.","Positive"
"2658","Love it.","Positive"
"2659","The Echo has so many features it is very difficult to use out of the box.  They should include one of the books that can educate the user.  The Echo also pushes the user to join Amazon Prime to enable all of the features.  At this point I am exploring  Prime, trying to establish if  it is worth the fees.","Negative"
"2660","The whole house LOVES our echo. The speaker quality is amazing given the relative small size. It is very easy to set up and use. Best Christmas gift to date!","Positive"
"2661","I love my Echo!!!","Positive"
"2662","Alexa is amazing she does alot of stuff and I can't wait to see what they come up with next.","Negative"
"2663","Alexa is mostly another marketing gimmick to get you to buy additional items such as Prime music or expensive wifi Alexa controlled thermostats, etc. Or the stand that only takes up more counter space and collects dust. Many of the requests you make to Alexa only responds with ""can't answer that, go to my app or this song request requires Prime music"". Also the device can't answer many simple questions that are right there in google. There are really only a few useful things Alexa does without added expense. Set a timer (so you don't have to push microwave buttons)  shuffle music, and check the temp. outside. The concept is great but the current model is way too restrictive right out of the box.","Positive"
"2664","So Far So Good. I really don't have any big negatives to say, I mean Alexa struggles to understand some easy questions but other than that she does exactly what she is supposed to. Excellent sound quality and runs (specific) smart home devices, Highly Recommend the Echo for anyone looking for a bluetooth speaker that does more than just playing music.","Positive"
"2665","Bought as xmas present, lots of fun, great device","Positive"
"2666","I purchased three of these as Christmas gifts and everyone including myself love them.","Positive"
"2667","No stars. It worked great until March 13. It started getting really choppy with Amazon streaming music playback.  I thought maybe it was having a bad day, or my internet was. Pandora streamed fine, movies streamed fine on my smart tv. The next day it still sucked. I went to return it. Turns out the last day it was eligible for returns was March 12. The day after it's eligible to be returned, performance degrades so it is useless to stream music, which is 90% of the reason I got it. Boo Amazon. Seriously, boo.","Positive"
"2668","Perfect","Positive"
"2669","I bought my ECHO to function primarily as an alarm clock. Amazon advertises that it can do this. Unfortunately Amazon didn't mention that there was a known issue with the time not always being correct. When daylight savings time went into effect my alarm never went off causing me to be late for work. Customer service was prompt and admitted to there being a problem, but only gave the general ""we are working on the problem, but have no idea how long it will take to fix.""  As an alarm clock Echo is a 1 star because I can't trust it. The second star is because it's nice as a music source. Though on rare occasions it refuses to play. Echo also can't hear commands when the volume is to high, negating voice commands as an option. Nice idea, but needs work.","Positive"
"2670","Very nice. No one needs one but it sure is fun having one","Positive"
"2671","A useful addition to the house.","Positive"
"2672","So far I love my Echo. It pairs nicely with my TP-Link light bulbs and has a decent speaker for listening to Pandora. I especially love all of the different skills; from adventure games, to jokes, to pick-up lines. The only thing I could do without is the need to repeat myself much of the time. If I wanted to repeat myself I would have a husband and kids....","Positive"
"2673","I love, love my Amazon Echo! It is both informative and entertaining. I especially like playing my Prime Music. I think the music sounds great. I would advise getting the remote, it makes it a lot easier, at least for me. Buy, it you will love it!","Positive"
"2674","Really need to work on simple Bing searches to compete with google. Other than that meets expectations.","Positive"
"2675","Love love love! So glad I purchased !!","Positive"
"2676","Love Alexa. !!!!!","Positive"
"2677","Love it","Positive"
"2678","I don't feel like it warrants the money. All we use her for is to listen to music. Half the time she can't understand us or the question we ask she sends us to Bing (which I could do that). Not worth the money or the time. I'd rather not have anything then this.","Positive"
"2679","Does exactly what it said. Don't use it as much as I though we would,but entertained my daughter enough to justify buying it","Positive"
"2680","This is really cool! I've had it for 1day I and can't stop asking it questions. It's a lot of fun and entertaining! Glad I bought it.","Positive"
"2681","Loved it!","Positive"
"2682","GREAT GIFT!!!","Positive"
"2683","The whole family is enjoying asking Alexa questions.  Great product!","Positive"
"2684","love it! Use it mainly for music but its an awesome unit","Positive"
"2685","Just added wifi enabled lights in our house -- just to see if Alexa's ""user interface"" was as easy as I hoped it would be.  It is. I have, subsequently, ordered additional lighting -- and am using bulbs that do NOT require a hub.  The cool thing is, I can control my lights with Alexa AND when I'm not at home I can control the lights with my smartphone.","Positive"
"2686","Best electronic I bought!!!!!  Love Alexa!!!  Can't believe all she can do!!!","Positive"
"2687","So far, so good.  I really need to optimize its usage so I've changed from the main living room to the kitchen/breakfast nook where my family spends most of their time.","Positive"
"2688","like it a lot but need more up dates to be great","Positive"
"2689","Sent back... paranoid about surveillance!","Negative"
"2690","It's a really good device, but I think still needs to have more features in terms of other countries, I'm from Argentina and I cann't  set my address in order to receive the local whether which is basic.","Positive"
"2691","Haven't really found a great need for it.","Positive"
"2692","We like our Echo, however,  there are a lot of commands/questions Alexa can't answer or understand.  The Echo's speaker is good.","Positive"
"2693","I have the echo and the dot. I love them both until lately when I ask for a particular radio that I used to get with no problem now all it does is bring up a rap station. I have unplugged and reset and done everything and can't solve the problem. Don't know who to contact.","Positive"
"2694","Bought for my son, they really enjoy this.","Positive"
"2695","GREAT","Positive"
"2696","What can i say We love Alexa","Positive"
"2697","I'm just going to say ditto to all of the positive reviews. So much has been said, don't need to repeat. Will add this...my family really enjoys the magic door. We sit together and listen to the story and take turns telling it where to go next. Great way to spend some quality time together with a story!","Positive"
"2698","Note to Amazon...more skills like that would be excellent. Skills that can be done with friends and family not just simple answers to questions. Thanks!","Positive"
"2699","We spent over three hours trying to get our Echo to connect to our wi-fi network and register it with Amazon.  Apparently some people get lucky, but we finally gave up.  The instructions are not adequate and you should not have to search the internet for clues like a Pokemon Go player when setting up a device like this.  If it doesn't connect right away you are screwed.  We threw ours in the trash since we didn't think it should go in any of the recycling bins.","Positive"
"2700","Bought it has a gift for my wife.....she loves it","Positive"
"2701","Love my Echo!","Positive"
"2702","much fun","Positive"
"2703","Product arrived in mint condition, shipping was suppose to be one day shipping but arrived 3 days late, Alexa app is un responsive and crashes frequently causing me to have to uninstall and reinstall to work properly. Other than that amazing product, speakers are very good and surprising for such small size, bass and treble are balanced.","Positive"
"2704","Outstanding and lots of fun and help!","Positive"
"2705","Great product.","Positive"
"2706","Works great. still figuring out the features.","Positive"
"2707","Everything is great but please do something with the phone calls we need it","Positive"
"2708","Love the Amazon Echo.  When buying through Amazon you get regular updates as to what's new and available.  Definitely purchase through Amazon Prime.","Positive"
"2709","The programing screw up around daylight savings changeover is just beyond understanding. My unit did not make the changeover at 2am like all of my other devices so my alarm didn't go off in the morning to wake me up. Luckily I had another device set to wake me for work that day. Later when I investigated the error I discovered that my timezone had been erased so when I attempted to set the timezone it would not allow me. Apparently there is a time zone for America and a time zone for US. If you select America you will consistently get your time zone reset. If you live in the US you must select US for your country. When I asked text support what country America was I did not really get any sort of answer. I find that such an incredible oversight and amateurish mistake that I just can't seem to wrap my head around it. This is the kind of crap that happens when you source your programming work out to a third world country. I certainly hope Amazon can address this not just short term but long-term if they hope to maintain their hold on the AI device market. That being said other than this current issue that was resolved I really do like my echo device.","Positive"
"2710","We love our echo....Don't know how I lived without it.  My husband made fun of me for wanting this and now he uses it even more than me!!!","Positive"
"2711","I bought this one for my daughter.  It works great and she loves it","Positive"
"2712","Somewhat limited in music, but overall petty good.","Negative"
"2713","When you take the lighting and heating controls out of the equation, it's basically a hands free version of Siri.  Does that justify the cost?  Probably not, but it's a neat gizmo.  I use the device primarily for the timer feature when cooking in the kitchen.  I also like how she'll play Pandora, provide the weather.","Positive"
"2714","This item is very basic and is really just a stereo. Never answers the questions you ask.","Positive"
"2715","Great for all the current and future capabilities.","Positive"
"2716","Very very awesome product. It has crisp sound and it's very easy to set up. I had it set up within 7 minutes of receiving it. It can tell you anything you want to know and the sound is so amazing I can't stress it enough. It's worth the money very happy with it.","Positive"
"2717","I <3 Alexa.  This is a fantastic product.  I have been very happy with how it works.  Her continued learning and programming is an added bonus I didn't expect.  Very easy to use and setup.  The software is also very easy to use.","Positive"
"2718","We are loving our Echo. Very useful and so much fun.","Positive"
"2719","Love it!","Positive"
"2720","Alexa is very helpful.  Just ask away and she'll give you an answer.","Positive"
"2721","Awesome product.","Positive"
"2722","Easy to use, great sound and a helpful item to have around the house.  Will be buying another for our master bedroom","Positive"
"2723","I LOVE this product , easy to set up , and alexa is so helpful! There is not one regret from this purchase!","Positive"
"2724","Great stuff!","Positive"
"2725","I waited to leave a honest and fair review, I wanted to get past the hype and the ravings of my friends to find out what Alexa can do for me ms Average a non Amazon Prime account holder.  Great for news and weather, quick checking facts, shopping lists and timers for cooking, radio stations.  Music well you might end up spending more to join Amazon music, I use Spotify managed to work how to make it work on her myself, audio books... again join as a prime if you want that function.  I don't need her turning lights on, etc","Positive"
"2726","great product at a great price","Positive"
"2727","It's a fun product, but not a must have - the app","Positive"
"2728","Needs some serious work can be very frustrating closing out on you and isn't ms average friendly.  All in all I enjoy her company.","Positive"
"2729","amazing.i use it every day love music and the sound is great. wish I had one years ago.","Positive"
"2730","Love our Alexa... she talks out of the blue... does not always get it right, but I have faith it will get better with time. I do enjoy shopping list, calendar, todo list, and list to any music in all rooms... the timers too! It's endless! When I need to spell a word I just ask my gal. Had a few strokes so I rely on her so much and she helps me through my days... very happy!","Positive"
"2731","So good even the CIA uses it! :]","Positive"
"2732","Purchased as a gift.  Receiver seems very happy with it.","Positive"
"2733","This was a gift for a friend. I already own one and knew he would like it.","Positive"
"2734","I rate the amazon alexa a 4 star because some music it doesn't even play for you and says to play the full song you have to buy it. And when you ask it questions most of the time you won't get a answer. [I recommend the google home which is better and $50 dollars cheaper.","Positive"
"2735","Still a ways to go to be very useful but it is fun to have. She and I both learn.","Positive"
"2736","This is mostly used for fun and listening to music, but I really enjoy it.","Positive"
"2737","I never thought I'd love this thing so much, or use it as often as I do, but I now depend on it daily. I do my shopping list on it (which then goes right to a list on my phone), and I can stream my favorite radio stations from around the country (or the world) and listen to great music for free. This is kind of like the classic Star Trek computer, but with a better voice. Fantastic.","Positive"
"2738","Still learning on how to use . Customer support has been very good.  Ordered a book on how to maximize its use.","Positive"
"2739","Great product...we've purchased 7 of them!","Positive"
"2740","thanks, we love it","Positive"
"2741","She can't hear me anymore unless I scream. Has gotten worse and worse since day one with the device and now I have to push the button on top to get her to listen. The dots work great but echo is terrible. Not worth the cost increase. Buy a dot and hook speakers to it.","Positive"
"2742","Great for setting alarms, weather updates and music.","Positive"
"2743","great","Positive"
"2744","Wish I had bought this sooner. Coupled with my hue bulbs and wemo plugs, I've become lazier than ever and I love that fact.","Positive"
"2745","I am extremely disappointed with the Amazon Echo.  I understand that electronic devices do not last forever, but in two years my Echo has stopped working.  I take care of it and other than a defect, it should not just stop working.  This makes me question the quality of Amazon products.  A product that costs so much and displays your the Amazon name should be of a better quality.  A $20 consolation and a ""there is nothing we can do"" is very disappointing.  I recommend that all customers think twice before purchasing.","Positive"
"2746","I absolutely love this! I use Alexa everyday. So helpful and entertaining.","Positive"
"2747","Would not buy or recommend product does not work as advertised  Listed what was wrong but it was censored by Amazon  There is no support the techs are rude will not help I have been called a lair by amazon I stuck with $180 paper weight","Positive"
"2748","I've had the unit 8 months and I've grown a hate for it.  Mainly because it never seems to understand what I want.  I order double A batteries and end up with triple A.  I as if I need a coat and it rymes off what the weather will be like later.  Ask it to order obit fun it asks me if I want to buy a audio book.  It's such a crap voice recognition.  Everyone laughs that I have such a hard time.  I've ran speech sessions and it's zero improvement.  It's in the quietest part of the living room.","Positive"
"2749","I love talking to Alexa!","Positive"
"2750","One of the best electronics I have ever owned. Sound is fantastic.","Positive"
"2751","Most of the responses we get are ""I'm sorry, I don't know the answer"" or ""I'm sorry, I didn't understand the question"".  When asked to play music, some genres are unable to be found or there are limited selections.  She is able to give us the daily weather and make shopping lists for us, which is handy.  Unfortunately, I missed the 30 day return window or I would return it.  Wish I'd bought Google Home instead.","Negative"
"2752","Extremely disappointed.  I have an Echo & a Dot.  I should have returned them before the return period expired.  We have been trying for months to find some use for it.  Sometimes it can understand a simple question about the weather.  I hear it's great for ordering Amazon stuff, but I prefer to verify/compare prices before reordering anything.  I almost always have to go back to my Android phone and say ""ok google"" to get questions answered.  I cannot recommend this product and would like to return it.","Positive"
"2753","It's hard to explain just how useful the Echo is until you own one and start using it as part of your daily routine.  Getting weather, traffic, news,  are just some of the more common uses.  I manage my outlook calendar with Echo and I also use the unlimited music subscription.  Recently my wife and I have been adding Philips Hue lights to our home and it's nice to have Alexa turn your lights on and off for you.","Positive"
"2754","Great for music and such.  Need to tie it to Nest and get some lamps to control.  The beginning of something great if you like tech!","Positive"
"2755","Nice echo, I now have 1 echo and 3 echo dots. Think I'm addicted.","Negative"
"2756","Love Alexa!","Positive"
"2757","A lot of fun, and very helpful to have around the house!","Positive"
"2758","Such a shame for so much promise.","Positive"
"2759","It's surprising what Echo can NOT do.  It reacts to women's voices better than mens'.  Also, the frequency with which I get: ""I'm sorry, I don't have the information for the question you just asked"" is highly annoying.  Strictly a toy with a good speaker.  Anyone with a smartphone doesn't need this toy.  And I HATE that it is constantly listening, often perking up without the Wake Words.  Maybe we should worry about Google spying on us. What happened to ""Do no Evil"" Eric Schmidt?","Negative"
"2760","After  having this in our home for a short period of time, we felt it was way too ""weird"".  The information obtained through media sources that these devices are ""ON"" at all times is creepy to say the least.  Not that we are talking about anything others cannot hear - the mere fact that these devices allow eavesdropping by government or outside intruders of any kind is unacceptable by ""FREE"" citizens.  If we all continue to accept these devices into our everyday lives we are setting ourselves up for a future similar to ""The Hunger Games"", Divergent, etc.  ""1984"" is definitely not part of my future agenda for life in the United States .... all these technical wonders have not been perfected enough for safety within our homes.  I do not even subscribe to Facebook because I do not like the intrusion on my personal life - I choose to share my personal life with people I trust....and that does not include Government and whomever wishes to harm me.","Negative"
"2761","Not smart as I thought it was going to be. 80% of the time doesn't understand (don't know) commands. In my opinion speakers are not as good as some reviewers says, for $190 you can buy better bluetooth speakers. Cannot hear when music is playing or if the tv is on, even if the volume is low. I live in a small studio and in order for it to listen the place has be completely silence. Very dissapointed.","Positive"
"2762","I was not sure how we would use this product.  BUT I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! I use it to stream music, my books through audible and to maintain my shopping list.  It is so awesome to say ""Alexa add eggs to the shopping list"" and it show up on my shopping list via the Alexa app.  We have found a lot of fun features to enable.  My daughters favorite is the magic door.  I like the jeopardy game and twenty questions.  This has turned into a really awesome addition to our home.  I look forward to future updates and seeing the new ways we will use this product.","Positive"
"2763","ECHO VS THE DOT: I am adding this because I myself asked this question.  If you have a bluetooth speaker system in your home already then go ahead and go with the Dot.  If you do not then go with the regular sized Echo.  The speaker quality is pretty awesome in the Echo unit.  I am pleased with this.  It was worth the cost!","Positive"
"2764","Love it. Get a kick out of Alexa.","Positive"
"2765","It's great!","Positive"
"2766","This is by far the best investment I have made in years...I basically use my Echo and Echo Dot for music purposes. The sound is excellent! I still make purchases of CD's occasionally, but that is solely for the purpose of using the auto rip system which goes into My Music, which plays through my Echo and Echo Dot. I haven't had any problems with either the Echo or the Echo Dot.","Negative"
"2767","Very nice addition to our home.  Just wish it was more compatible with iPhone music and calendar.  Other than that highly recommended.","Positive"
"2768","It was not able to answer our questions and we couldn't afford to pay for streaming music with it  We thought all of that was inclusive  But no..","Positive"
"2769","I love my echo.","Positive"
"2770","its fine","Positive"
"2771","Love it. Does everything. Has hundreds of commands that it responds to. I especially enjoy the music collection which seems to be infinite.","Positive"
"2772","Love Alexa and all her daily antics. I'm still learning her skills, but hope to get that down soon!","Positive"
"2773","Really enjoy the music.","Positive"
"2774","I was originally going to return this item but decided upon keeping it. Can be difficult to apply but if you do it patiently it will go up fine. My biggest issue is that the image makes it look huge in the wall. The image is what I expected. The one I got is not nearly as big. It works but wasn't what I was going for.","Positive"
"2775","I tried to train her but we are having a communication problem. I'll keep trying but wish I never bought this.","Negative"
"2776","Works perfectly","Positive"
"2777","I'm so glad I bought this.. makes routine at home convenient","Positive"
"2778","When it works its great.  Not so great if you live in a place where they have Daylight SavingTime.  Programming Alexa to turn on the lights is a nightmare.  Getting the music to transfer to Itunes is hit and miss and she will absolutely not play my nature sounds music "" Rain"" album.  I think you'd need to be a computer expert or perhaps wait a few years till they work the bugs out.","Positive"
"2779","great","Positive"
"2780","Dumber than I expected.  No daylight savings time - it knows when it is, but didn't adjust its clock.  To many skills that need to be added to make it knowledgeable.  Even when skills are added you have to remember the skills name so you can ask alexa to the ask the skill for the answer.  Very disappointing.  No one is capable of remembering all of the various skills' names to know which one to ask alexa to task.","Positive"
"2781","What it does do directly it does well.  Love the smartthings integration, but that's one of the few directly supported skills.","Positive"
"2782","Doesn't understand commands very well","Positive"
"2783","Love love love Alexa!!!","Positive"
"2784","had for about 4 months, starting to randomly wake without its name being said during regular conversation","Negative"
"2785","Arrived in timely manner and packaged properly. Easy to set up.","Positive"
"2786","Great product","Positive"
"2787","I am really lovin this fantastic little system...the speaker is high quality, and the unit is amazingly easy to use and enjoy. We also purchased the DOT to expand our system, and add to our outdoor covered patio area for music and news.  If you don't have one, you are really missing out on an extraordinary system!","Positive"
"2788","I love this device, the functionality, the quality of materials, the app capability. All this considered, besides music, I find myself neglecting it.","Positive"
"2789","I can't hang out in the living room without noise canceling headphones anymore.  If I am doing work or trying to watch TV my wife will blast music on it from the app to get my attention.  It doesn't turn off unless you unplug it that is dumb.  Hate worst purchase I have ever made.","Negative"
"2790","Love, love, love it!","Positive"
"2791","It has changed the way we do things in this household.  My grand kids love to ask for Jokes and their favorite music.","Positive"
"2792","Have had Echo for two weeks now and I look forward to coming home and asking Alexa to play any song I want. Really like using it as a timer and alarm clock too. No problems whatsoever. I'm really, really glad I bought it.","Positive"
"2793","I bought this and totally love it. Saves SO much time. If I want to hear my favorite song, I ask Alexa. If I want to hear the news, it's great!!! Whaaaaa!!!","Positive"
"2794","So fun! Just a great invention, investment and overall great item to have!!!","Positive"
"2795","I recommend the Echo and not the dot because you will have to buy your own speaker with the dot - just more stuff.","Positive"
"2796","I am about to send this device back because I can't find a way to make it work and am really tired of trying.  Something like this should not be released to the market unless ALL those who purchase it can easily access an easy connection. I am very disappointed as it was a Christmas present for my husband and the problem is still not resolved.","Positive"
"2797","Truly enjoying Amazon Echo.  So happy I purchased.","Positive"
"2798","I have a love hate relationship with my echo. I love that it works w smartthings, ifttt, haiku fan and my other smart devices. However, I hate how she sometimes hears me, chimes in without being asked and I have been having major issues w the grocery list. Between adding items online or by the app, data gets lost and that can be frustrating. Also, I do not use it for music. My Sonos is SOOOOO much better.","Positive"
"2799","Needs a detailed guide sent with it.  Great sound and easy to do basic set up but needs directions for other uses.","Positive"
"2800","The Best Device since the cellular phone","Positive"
"2801","This is a great item!  It's functional, easy to figure out, handy, etc.  I can't say enough good about it!  After much debate, I purchased the starter kit and now it turns my living room lamps on and off.  Love it!!  Love it!!!  Love it!!!","Positive"
"2802","Not only informative but so fun to use.  I bought one for my grandkids, and it has proven to be a great way to practice spelling words for upcoming tests.  Being a Prime Member makes the music selections the best.  Lots of listening going on these days thanks to Alexa.","Positive"
"2803","Refurbished on works great. We enjoy being able to ask her questions and definitions.","Positive"
"2804","Very limited function. I need to remember all of the third party app to command Alexa.","Negative"
"2805","My family uses Alexa every single day. The kids love to interact with ""her"", and they love all the corny jokes she tells. I use it to get updates on the daily news, get a quick check of the weather, and to set timers for cooking and the kids homework. We also love the music stations, and the ability to listen to my favorite talk radio stations and sports. This has been one of my better purchases over the last several years. I would recommend it to anyone!!","Positive"
"2806","Love my echo! It allows me to play music while working around the house!","Positive"
"2807","Very impressive","Positive"
"2808","Love it,  but it is expensive when adding on  bulbs and switches","Negative"
"2809","Absolutely Love it!","Positive"
"2810","Great product","Positive"
"2811","Works great!  We just have to figure out all of the things it does.  It works great for a radio too!","Positive"
"2812","Love it!!!","Positive"
"2813","We love the Echo. Ordering, delivery, all went as planed.","Positive"
"2814","Music n sound fabulous! Not as smart as i hoped n was led to believe by amazon!","Positive"
"2815","We have yet scratched the surface of what Alexa can do, and I love ""her"".","Negative"
"2816","Echo is a nice addition to the family.  Alexa answers most questions with lots of insight and learns as she goes. We don't have the home setup to use her other features, so her sole function is as companion when someone is home alone.","Positive"
"2817","Alexa is great","Positive"
"2818","Perfect!","Positive"
"2819","Nothing Special. Does not understand the question half the time or, just does not know. Asked where the Football Hall of Fame is located? Has no idea. Google comes up with the answer right now.","Positive"
"2820","I have both the Echo, and her little sister, Dot. Both work exactly the same. The difference is that the Dot is way cheaper.  However, and that's a BIG  HOWEVER, the Dot has pathetic speakers. I use the Dot on my bedside nightstand, and the larger Echo in my living room. I think you can connect better speakers to the Dot, but I don't know how, yet. So, your choice is to save money (DOT), or have really fantastic speakers (ECHO).","Positive"
"2821","Alexa couldn't understand 6 out of 10 things. Hopefully it will get better. May try later","Positive"
"2822","Its dumb. 85% of the things I ask her to do she responds with ""I dont know how to answer that"" I said ""Alexa, Play some different music"" clear as day five times. Not once was she able to change Rhianna from the radio. I'm going to give it a few more days then return it for a refund.","Positive"
"2823","Easy set and works great","Positive"
"2824","Pretty cool","Positive"
"2825","My Amazon Echo stopped working within 7 months from the date of purchase... I tried calling the customer support and couldn't connect. Since, I am travelling last 6 months I am never getting proper time to focus on these small things. Not sure what has to be done.. My direct line is +1 925-415-0154 or you can call on my India number +91 997-225-2270","Positive"
"2826","But my speak is no bad... but with my anxiety and pituitary andenoma","Negative"
"2827","Like a lot!","Positive"
"2828","If Echo could answer even 10% of the questions asked I'd be happy. Ex. "" what network is Modern Family on?"" She didn't know the answer. Pretty basic.  Stop with the bells and whistles and the dimming of the lights and the locking of the doors and have her answer a simple question.","Positive"
"2829","Okay, we've had the echo for several days now so I can give an initial review only. My personal opinion is that this is an over priced product for its current model and capabilities. The sound is of good quality and balance treble and bass, has ability to fill room with sound similar to Bose accustcs but not even close in clarity, but definitely adequate for most people. There are several issues I've noticed from the get go. Once volume is above 4 Alexa can't hear voice commands. So a remote is definitely needed. ( Should be included at this price point) The most important issue is that Amazon uses Bing, not Google as its search engine, that's not likely ever to change. Amazon is in direct competition with Google for this market. From reading reviews it seems Amazon has rushed production of its devices in its ecosystem too often before they are ready for release. I'm certain many issues with this Echo will be addressed with firmware updates. If you really can't easily afford this device even using flex pay, my recommendation is to pass on this product and purchase an Echo DOT instead. The Dot actually can hear commands at any volume level and the sound is acceptable for music. Again if buying this product stretches your budget even a little, my advice is to pass on it. Wait for the inevitable second or third generation and just purchase a Dot. The Dot is clearly the MUCH better buy as it can do everything the Echo can do, without the artificial surround sound.","Positive"
"2830","If I wrote this product after receiving the Echo, I would have given it 5 stars. Think about it, the Echo is not a tool; I can't see anyway that it can be miss used, or handled incorrectly which would cause deteriorating wear and tear. It is an electronic device that sits where you place it - in your home or business - and it responds when questions are asked. Why after two years, the product would cease to work? After speaking to Echo support today, I was told it would cost me $162 for a support contract, to get it fixed. Seriously, Amazon, you could do better. In the garbage it goes, and I will not be trying anything else from Amazon, ever again.","Positive"
"2831","BOUght it for my girl friend as a gift and she used it every day to listen to music.","Positive"
"2832","I know I've only scratched the surface of the skills available for Amazon Echo. Very easy to set up and covers most of my downstairs area. Currently I use it to control lighting, updates on weather, news, music and podcasts. The beauty of this device is its ability to develop and update and not become obsolete in the near future.","Positive"
"2833","need to get a white one for the wife so it could be in the kitchen.  Music selection of Prime has went down in recent.  Need to link my Spotify to it.  My bad.  Kids LOVE it to play music on.  Will try and re-work subscribe and save over the weekend.","Positive"
"2834","My Alexia quit playing music from the Amazon music library after q couple months of ownership.  I googled the problem and others also are having the same issue.  I would not purchase this product without first researching the problem.  Other than that she does continue to answer questions and will play music from your phone once connected","Negative"
"2835","We have both the Echo and the Tap. Both are great. The sound quality is impressive for the size of the device, and the voice recognition is quality. Alexa is now my kitchen timer, my Bluetooth speaker, my news feed, my traffic update, and my quick Google search. We use the Tap for when the husband is out in the garage and wants music, or for a sound machine in the bedroom at night. I'm impressed with all that Alexa can do, and I can't wait to see even more of her abilities as we connect to other smart home devices.","Positive"
"2836","Love, love my Echo!","Positive"
"2837","I wish I could give it zero stars.  I bought one and it wouldn't setup.  I spent hours on the phone with tech support and it still wouldn't setup.  They said they would call me back with more information within 72 hours.  They never called.  I called again and spent a few more hours with tech support and they finally realized it was broken and issued me a tag to send it back.  They also shipped me a replacement echo.  Guess what?  Same thing.  I tried to set it up, and it failed miserably.  I tried several times and failed each time. I called tech support again and spent another couple hours and it still wouldn't work, so they said they would escalate it to a developer level trouble ticket and call me back in 4-5 days.  Well, guess what?  They never called.  I got sick of it so I got a tag and sent it back.  I got my refund today, and amazon had the balls to deduct $24 as a restocking fee refund deduction.  Great!  A restocking fee for something that never worked and for which amazon never called me back.  So I got to spend more time on the phone with customer service and I was initially told I was going to get $14 of the $24 back, and I was pretty blunt that paying a restocking fee for something that is broken is a bunch of crap.  Finally got my $24 back.","Positive"
"2838","slightly over priced and every once in a blue moon glitches. Does not seem to handle small vibrations while cooking very well. works as intended though","Positive"
"2839","As a fairly tech-savvy person (I work in tech) and after reading rave reviews of the Echo (also hearing them from friends), I took the plunge and purchased one. I have to admit I'm mystified and willing to admit it might just be me, but this seems like a completely useless and often annoying adjunct to the tech currently in my home. I can look things up faster on my phone or computer, my phone apps do a better job than the ones currently compatible with the Echo (including things like news headlines, movie times, traffic, weather and public transport reports, meditation guidance, the whole gamut). I already have decent, wifi/Bluetooth compatible speakers and Echo's ability to have my Kindle books read to me (a feature I was excited about before purchasing) turns out to mean I get to hear them spoken out loud in a flat toneless voice, which is not exactly appealing or helpful. In addition, I feel I have to almost shout to have my voice picked up by the Echo (unpleasant) and the email updates from Amazon on how people are using the device are frankly creepy (I mean, I already know they're collecting and aggregating data, but having that fact routinely thrust in my face isn't appreciated.) I'm glad most people love it (it's the wave of the future, after all), but I'm really sorry that I spent the money and then waited too long to return it-there are more enjoyable things to do with $200.","Positive"
"2840","Love this, Alexa has better recognition than Seri. I have trouble remembering the exact phrases to use to get Alexa to work. I need to practice.... great product","Positive"
"2841","For the price, the experience is same like echo dot.","Positive"
"2842","It doesn't know much at all. I have gotten used to hearing ""sorry I couldn't find the answer to your question"". Very disappointing product that was highly recommended.","Negative"
"2843","Still doesn't work?","Positive"
"2844","We have enjoyed Echo but it has suddenly stopped working. Following the reset direction provided by Amazon has not worked and now the device is useless. Be warned that it may not last. Really questioning the price charged for the length of time that it has lasted.","Negative"
"2845","Fantastic CIA listening device. Records all your private conversations  uploads to the NSA via the cloud. Even locates at risk individuals within the home and automatically alerts federal authorities when you're doing something out of line. This will be a super handy device when the government comes to take the firearms.","Positive"
"2846","Still getting used to it and sometimes it doesn't understand simple questions. But overall we like it.","Positive"
"2847","I love my Alexa!!","Positive"
"2848","Amazon Echo is amazing and exceeded our expectations","Positive"
"2849","Alexa is a lot of fun.  Its like having a friend do favors for you........wake up alarms, specific music, weather reports, factoids.....the list is endless.","Positive"
"2850","Alexa is a wonder!  I ask for the morning temperature as I wake up.  I have her tune into NPR.  She sets timers as i cook.  She's also an excellent entertainer - ""ALEXA, play Bonnie Raitt"".  She does it all!  I absolutely LOVE my ECHO and cannot recommend this product highly enough!","Positive"
"2851","Excellent","Positive"
"2852","Oh my God! Can't say enough how I love my Alexa Echo. I am only just scratching the surface of what she can do, and more skills are added daily. There is no way to keep up, I just pick and choose whats relevant to me. She's almost has a personality just suited to me and sorta like a real person when I interact with her. (Don't realky know how to explain it.) I think in a few years most everyone will be using technology like this as a matter of course, just like how cell phones evolved and became a tool we all take for granted now.","Positive"
"2853","Too much fun!","Positive"
"2854","I love this song much! Just ask for my favorite music and Alexa plays it. Ask what the weather is like when I'm in a hurry and much more!","Positive"
"2855","This device has changed my life, I integrated it with smart plugs.  It works wonderful and playing music out of it sounds awesome.  I liked it so much I got the Dot also for my bedroom.  Echo is an excellent product","Positive"
"2856","Iwish when i pair a bluetooth speaker with Echo music would play out of both speakers","Positive"
"2857","love this item works great and is phone as heck","Positive"
"2858","RIP Echo: July 2015 - February 2017","Negative"
"2859","A lot of fun to use.","Positive"
"2860","Troubleshot with Amazon (very nice people): voice so muffled, the device is useless.","Negative"
"2861","Hardware problem! :(","Negative"
"2862","Amazon: ""sucks to be you.""","Negative"
"2863","We love Alexa!  Since she came into our lives we listen to a lot more music.  The quality of the sound is great for us and she responses beautifully to our questions.  Everyday we hear a new ""PG-13"" joke that makes us laugh.  Our home is >1000 sq. ft. and we can hear her throughout.  Perfect for us!","Positive"
"2864","Cool and fun","Positive"
"2865","I got mine and I just LOVE IT!!! EVER MADE. it so fun to use and very easy.","Positive"
"2866","Thank you Amazon for making the best thing ever made in my book. if you don't have one","Positive"
"2867","your the BEST!!!!!!","Positive"
"2868","pretty sure the majority of people have a general idea of what the echo can do at this point so I won't waste time with those details, and just jump straight to my thoughts.","Positive"
"2869","Its amazing.","Positive"
"2870","Grand kids love to talk to it and tell her to play wild songs, very good to keep up with the weather.","Positive"
"2871","I do love my Echo. She sounds great and is a lot of fun. My mother would always comment on how much she liked it, but they don't have Amazon Prime (they won't do any shopping or banking online at all, they just refuse). Since they don't have Prime they wouldn't be able to use some of Alexa's features, so when the Google Home came out, I bought one of those so I could compare.","Positive"
"2872","Google Home answers a lot more questions, and you don't need to enable Skills to do other things. I can ask it how to make an old fashioned and it tells me, whereas on Alexa you need to word it just right and have the bartender skill enabled. Alexa seems more ""polished"" than Home, though, and with Prime she has a great music library, and she can tell me ""where's my stuff"" when I'm waiting for an Amazon order. Then again Google Home is improving by the day, and has the power of Google behind it. For example, I can ask Home for a flight status but Alexa is lost if I ask her.","Positive"
"2873","In my opinion, if you have Prime, Alexa is a great way to go. If you don't, Google Home is the way to go. By the way, both sound great to me music wise. I have a one bedroom condo and they both go way, way louder with clarity than I will ever play music. I really can't recommend one over the other for sound quality. Both are great, both are improving every day, and you'll be thrilled with either. I realize this probably won't help anyone on the fence decide which to buy, but if the only one you are deciding whether or not to buy, buy her!! You will love it.","Positive"
"2874","I am a huge fan of the echo and the technology. We have several echos, dots, and a tap in the house. We use it to turn on/off our tankless water heater, thermostat, outdoor lights (including landscape lights), basic pool functions, and play music. It's also a fun device with guests that visit and aren't familiar with it. A couple of recommendations for Amazon engineers, please create an outdoor solar powered speaker that I can place throughout the backyard, allow music to stream on multiple devices, create sound bars and other types of Alexa integrated speakers, tap is great, but create a battery powered version of the Echo so I can place it in the middle of a room without needing a cord, work with LiftMaster to allow Alexa to open/close the garage door, and integrate Alexa with home wired alarm systems (not just the cheap wireless systems), though I think it's the alarm companies that don't want to give up their total control of the system.","Positive"
"2875","Really enjoy this item and hear it for the kitchen to living room to computer room.  Good volume in depth for the price. A little tricky at first to get it to get used to your voice, and you have to say it right to get the music section scores for movies to be understood  and played.  Didn't buy the  Black dot and I don't think we need it","Positive"
"2876","purchased as gift for family member, happy with purchase","Positive"
"2877","I use it for music , it goes from room to room very easy. I love it","Positive"
"2878","I've had my echo for a while now and I did purchase the Philip's hue starter set to try and take advantage of some of its extra capabilities. It allows me to voice control my lightbulbs, which is super convenient, when it wants to work.","Positive"
"2879","Love it, but not always available to answer everything","Positive"
"2880","You can not beat the sound out of this cylinder. Lot's of fun.","Positive"
"2881","Alexa not as good as it's all cracked up to be. Poor range of information. ""Skills"" ability hard to organize.","Negative"
"2882","I liked it so much I bought a second echo for my bedroom. Cancelled Sirius and threw my Clock radio away. Alexa is unbelievable","Positive"
"2883","Works better than expecred","Positive"
"2884","This was a spoil myself kind of purchase.  I just wanted to play with the technology.  I'm finding it more and more useful in my daily life.  It is becoming such a convenience that I can't believe I waited this long to buy one.","Positive"
"2885","Not great outside US , don't waste money","Negative"
"2886","Amazing for home automation, sadly the controller settings aren't per device which means you need unique names for ever room as opposed to having a group named lights for each device/room.","Positive"
"2887","It worked for two months... that's it. I'm not sure if it's because they changed the Alexa app or what.","Positive"
"2888","Wish there were more stars that could be given.  The sound is amazing!  The design very clever - works great.","Positive"
"2889","Alexa is an extremely well designed piece of hardware, as is the Dot for that matter. Alexa's speaker produces excellent sound for a device of such small size. The range of music available with Prime, if not comprehensive, is still very broad, and one has the option of uploading music to the cloud to fill in the gaps. Try asking ""play some baroque music"" and she [a female pronoun sounds better than ""it"" somehow] will give her stock 'can't help you with that"" reply. Fortunately, Alexa can continue to evolve without having to replace the hardware (as Amazon and 3rd party app designers keep improving the back end), which is a nice change from the usual technology path where one's phones and laptops are 'over the hill' in a year or so.","Positive"
"2890","While I do LOVE amazon and have been a religious user and frequent shopper on here, I have to admit that I've come to expect amazon developed products to be lacking. For the most part, they get the job done, but usually neglect major details here and there that dull down the potential for maximum customer satisfaction. That being said, I do think this echo is one of their better items. However, my echo was gifted off my wishlist, and if I had to choose between echo and google home, I'd pick google without a second thought, because I trust their brand to deliver while I have doubts with amazon.","Positive"
"2891","The only thing I would change would be during set up - if the device I'm using is already connected to the WiFi,when not have Echo leverage the information.  It was a challenge to configure it but once it was up and running, I'm a very happy camper.","Positive"
"2892","The major problem being the inability as a new product owner is to get the unit up and running in a siplistic way.","Negative"
"2893","We were not impress to say the least.","Positive"
"2894","We have been having difficulty doing and did finally get it up and running ... Sort of.","Negative"
"2895","At the end of the day .... And our frustration level, having being pushed to the point I haven't experienced in many years ....","Negative"
"2896","It's pretty simple now ...","Positive"
"2897","Would I recommend it to a friend .. I think not.","Positive"
"2898","The dollars we spent for this unit .. $179.00 if memory serves me was a waist of time and money.","Positive"
"2899","I would certainly not recommend it to anyone in our group of friends.","Positive"
"2900","From what I've read, there are still a lot of things that Google can do that Alexa can't, but I don't have personal experience with GH to be able to compare the two. As far as the echo is concerned, I'm pretty satisfied with its performance. I really just wanted a Bluetooth speaker, so everything else is added bonus.","Positive"
"2901","Love it!","Positive"
"2902","I like it only flaw is web search ability","Negative"
"2903","Great gadget!!!","Positive"
"2904","I love my Echo. Wasn't sure if I needed one, but after I started using it I am so glad I made the purchase. Great for listening to music, radio stations and old time radio stories","Positive"
"2905","Fast service... great product","Positive"
"2906","Doesn't answer questions as well as I'd hoped, but is a great addition to my home automation environment.","Positive"
"2907","Fun to play with.","Positive"
"2908","Biggest piece of junk ever. Quits working at random. i have opened several tickets with Amazon and they do nothing. They have me unplug the item and plug it back in. How useful is that. The refuse to replace it. What terrible service. Be very cautious when purchasing this item. Be prepared to write it off if it quits working","Negative"
"2909","Awesome","Positive"
"2910","I never read any instructions on Alexa, but she hasn't given me any issue with basic commands I'd expect her to handle. I'm sure she can do more that I haven't discovered yet, but she does more than enough already. I tested out some random commands and she was happy to oblige. I was pretty surprised when I asked her to play Beyonc and she replied ""shuffling songs by Beyonc."" I wasn't Bluetooth'd so I assume that amazon music is a prime member perk. But if I ask her to play a specific song, she directs me to visit the music app where I guess I have to purchase those songs to get that command going, but it would be nice if she accessed my iTunes library instead of trying to make me buy the songs again.","Positive"
"2911","I loved it.  BUT, I purchased it for my elder parents.  They had a much harder time with it.  Originally we thought that it would entertain them with  answers to easy questions. But it ended up confusing them and actually stopped conversation. So I returned the product.  There were no problems with installing or use.  Just isn't something that worked for them.","Positive"
"2912","We love our Echo in fact bought two for our house!","Positive"
"2913","Awesome, usually.","Positive"
"2914","Our house has become a dancefloor! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D>","Positive"
"2915","It's pretty cool... not perfect... but it's pretty cool.","Positive"
"2916","Pros: Too many to list - My wife and I use it primarily for listening to music/radio, asking the time, weather, alarms (which is awesome when cooking) and creating shopping lists. It does those things almost perfectly. I also took a Dot with me to Australia and it was great having a little bit of home with my on the road.","Positive"
"2917","Cons:","Negative"
"2918","- When volume is high, the echo can't hear you say ""Alexa"" (or ""Echo"" or whatever word you use) in order to turn off, so I need to scream or walk over and turn it down.","Negative"
"2919","- It fails epically in comparison to the Google Home for general inquiries. It can do some things, but even for those things, you need to word the questions perfectly or it will not understand (asking for unit conversions (kgs to lbs is what I was trying to get) for example was pretty annoying, it took 3 or 4 tries before I worded it to Alexa's satisfaction)... very frustrating","Negative"
"2920","- You have to pay extra for all the music (and it still doesn't have ""everything"") - another slight downside that the youtube connectivity of the Google Home provides","Negative"
"2921","Setup was a little weird. The Alexa app isn't the greatest but it definitely beats the fire tv app.","Positive"
"2922","- Does not do ANYTHING without connectivity. This is pretty lame because how hard would it have been to have some internal smarts for things like alarms, asking the time, etc (for comparative purposes: the Google Home also fails in this department)","Negative"
"2923","- Did I mention how frustrating it is that general inquiries are almost never answered","Negative"
"2924","- Can't change the trigger name to anything you want - I know, this is a pretty stupid thing to have on the list, but while I'm writing things, might as well","Positive"
"2925","- Does not clean up after me","Positive"
"2926","My main issues with the echo... I hate that it has to be plugged in at all times, with an accessory sold separately to accommodate this function that should be built into any wireless speaker in this day and age, but amazon has a habit of bringing back prehistoric attributes to their products. Perfect example, the firestick being introduced to the public as a means to stream media, while the majority of people already own tablets laptops and cellphones that do all that already, and much more efficiently, and bringing nothing new to the table. There's nothing a firestick can do that the others can't, but there's plenty more they can do that the firestick can't. It's like unveiling dialup internet, in a world of wifi","Positive"
"2927","Honestly, it's a first generation thing, and any cons are just part of the growing process. This thing is really cool though. I hope the next iteration can fulfill those last few items on my cons list... ultimately, I hope to do as little as humanly possible, hopefully Alexa's future can provide this... hopefully they don't go all Cyberdyn on us - fingers crossed!","Negative"
"2928","Great speaker, can't do much else. It even made a amazon purchase I didn't ask it to make. Not impressed Siri is smarter","Positive"
"2929","We have the Echo and two Echo Dots, some smart plugs and bulbs too.  I love being able to walk in and just give a command and have lights, tv, etc. on demand.  We bought one for my mother-in-law because at over 80 years of age it was not as easy for her to get to light switches in her apartment if she had to get up in the middle of the night or when going to bed.  She now has trained her Echo (as we have too) with so many features and smart home options that since her husband's death, she seems to be in better spirits.  She tells us all the time how much she loves the Echo, it tells her jokes, plays games with her, plays music, gives her sports updates, and she can turn on and off lights and appliances with her voice.  The Echo is sooo much fun, easy to set up and link to your Amazon account for so little cost and effort.  Hope you enjoy your's as much as we're enjoying ours! Now if we can just get our local news station to stop saying ""Alexa"" and call it the Echo or Echo Dot that would be great! I cannot tell you how many times they have activated my Echo and I've had to tell Alexa to stop with orders or playing songs, etc. thanks to irresponsible anchor people.","Positive"
"2930","The search engine of Echo (neither the way used to understand the questions) is very limited","Negative"
"2931","Works well. Great speaker. She is smart but hope she goes to grad school...so much more would be fun.","Positive"
"2932","It's blocked from answering a lot of questions that Google will answer","Positive"
"2933","doesn't work well in canada","Positive"
"2934","Love our Echo! The voice commands work very well. We are still learning all the ways it can be used and are excited to see additional features and integration functions continuously added.","Positive"
"2935","I had actually bought Google Play first but returned it because I couldn't use it as a blue tooth speaker to play music from my phone. I feel like I'm still learning to use its features. Google was really good at answering all questions. Echo doesn't have all of the answers. I use it mainly for music, my morning commute times, and weather updates. My kids love it even though Alexa doesn't always understand them. I like the mute feature. I do believe I will learn to get better use of it once I take the time to learn more about it.","Positive"
"2936","Still trying to figure out what skills I need to download to answer the questions I ask. I expected the internet searching feature to be more intuitive.","Positive"
"2937","I also feel like it should have more noteworthy sound for its size. It's pretty big, and it does get decently loud, but for it's size, it should be rocking the night stand. There's like no bass to speak of.","Positive"
"2938","works well, when it responds.  Customer service was no help at all either.  The DoT works much better, and is cheaper.","Positive"
"2939","I have used this peice of tech now for a little over six months. I did not have much expectation and I really tried to take the time to give it plenty of chances to live up to it's own hype..which it doesn't. This product is a toy, and I realize that. I could forgive it if it just occasionally missed a command or went out but the problems have been consistent and nothing seems to be a permanent solution.","Positive"
"2940","The Echo is placed in my bedroom less than 20ft from the wireless router. I have a very stable connection and as a tech-lover I use a range of devices that really test and confirm that statement. However Echo is constantly losing connection when I give a command or saying she doesn't understand a command she understood in the same setting ten minutes earlier. Probably the most unnerving part is having to listen to echo say 'sorry I cannot connect right now, please check the settings in your alexa app'. When it is losing connection 3 or more times a day that message gets really obnoxious and there ought to be a way to turn it off. This of course leads to hundreds of connect then reconnect, power down, move closer to the router,and move anything that may cause disturbance to only have the same problem in a short while. Calls to support lead to little more advice than doing what I already have tried.","Positive"
"2941","This product cannot even get Bluetooth speaker right. With my phone right beside it it will play music for about 5 minutes before it starts wavering and the music sounds like it's coming in and out. My $30 Bluetooth speaker does a better job. This product has been relegated to a toy for my nieces to play with as they don't really have an expectation and are plenty pleased when they get a response the %40 of the time that Echo understands and responds (Jeopardy is their favorite) .The idea was wonderful and maybe in the future a better product will be made, but after giving it more than it's fair chances I felt I had to share my experiences.","Positive"
"2942","sound quality is actually not bad at all, easily fills a room with nice deep bass and crisp highs. though I do not yet have any smart home products having alexa around to assist with the daily scheduling and general questions as well as entertainment means is fantastic. the only reason I cant give it a full 5 stars is that if you are listening to it at more than 50% volume the microphones wont pick up your voice making the activation phrase useless. other than that its a truly wonderful product","Positive"
"2943","I love this lady!!!  At first I mostly used my Echo for music.  That's why I went with the Echo over the Dot.  Better sound quality overall.  Now that I've had the Echo a few months I've learned of many other tasks that make my life as easy as just asking.  I know I've only barely broken the surface of the Echo's abilities, but I'm having a blast as I go along.  My home is open concept and I have my Echo placed in a central location.  It understands my voice commands easily from out of the box.  You want to download the App to your phone.  That gives you more control and allows you to add ""Skills"" to your Echo.  I got it because I wanted it, not needed it.  I still don't think I need it, but I'm having fun with it and does come in very handy.  Especially if all you want to do is listen to music.  Just ask Alexa to play whatever, band, song or genre.","Positive"
"2944","Works fantastically for its purpose. Speakers sound great. Super glad I bought this.","Positive"
"2945","so useful","Positive"
"2946","This was a gift to my sister and she adores it!  I have the black one and I love Alexa.","Positive"
"2947","Works just like new.  Also bought Amazon Tap.  They are both great!","Positive"
"2948","It should also be able to integrate with the firestick, which it doesn't really, but can be linked with the firestick remote, and the remote can be used with echo but the echo can't control the firestick functions. Overall tho, I like it, but there's still much room for improvement","Negative"
"2949","Bought for wife.....she loves it....I use it too...just one of those neat little tech toys....","Positive"
"2950","This is an absolute piece of garbage. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Mine stopped working within a year and Amazon replaced it with a refurbished one that will not work. I stopped fooling with it and Amazon's service department.","Positive"
"2951","Flawless. It's a bit bigger than expected but it's very attractive. Great product easy and simple to use.","Positive"
"2952","Still figuring it out. Very cool","Positive"
"2953","I love this thing it's cool","Positive"
"2954","fun","Positive"
"2955","Approximately once a week isn't working and get the message Sorry I do not understand right now and try back later.  Very disappointing.","Negative"
"2956","Love but needs to know more info","Positive"
"2957","App will not open with the Samsung s7 just spins and spins, tried everything and looks like its a common problem according to the app reviews, I'm actually appalled amazon made such a poor app. Had to send this back since we can't set it up. Waist of time","Negative"
"2958","I have to fight with it for 20 mins just to play Hosley radio. It seems to find EVERYTHING that sounds like Hosley.. but not what I wanted. I ask it simple questions just like the google commercial... nothing. I just get ""I'm sorry I dont understand what you are asking."" Sure its a great looking and sounding device but it is lacking the brains. This was a nice attempt by Amazon but it's not Google. I want to throw it out the window. About the only thing it is good for is turning on the lights. Its a shame because I had high hopes for this device.","Positive"
"2959","WE LOVE OUR ECHO! It may seem a little pricey but it has been a great gadget to have in the house. We use it mostly for our smart lights, setting timers, listening to music, and asking random questions.","Positive"
"2960","I love it","Positive"
"2961","I love it!!!","Positive"
"2962","Best thing ever.","Positive"
"2963","Love it!","Positive"
"2964","This is one useful piece of technology! Fun facts, news, and music!","Positive"
"2965","Easy to setup to my home wi-fi. Fun and easy to use. Alexa can do many things. Play any music, turn lights on or off, give you the weather, etc. Great personal assistant for your home.","Positive"
"2966","It was great for 11.5 months. It powers up but then it will not perform any function.","Positive"
"2967","I must shout if the volume is over 4. My neighbors across the street know that I have an Echo. For the alarm, it can't hear me trying to turn it off so I have to press the button. Maybe I got a dud.","Negative"
"2968","My wife loves this.  So easy to play music or ask about the weather.","Positive"
"2969","Bought this as a gift for our son. Chose this item as a gift because we received an Echo (Alexa) as our own gift this past Christmas. I'm still learning about the range of things this electronic can do. So far, the most important thing Alexa can do for us is read books for my husband who is blind. The device remembers his books and picks up right where he stopped listening last. The next most important task that she performs is music ... when she is not reading she plays jazz tunes for us. I also like that Alexa can start a timer (for cooking purposes) even while playing music. (This girl can even multitask!! ha)","Positive"
"2970","Alexa isn't as smart as I imagined she would be. She is tied into the Microsoft Bing Internet network, which makes sense as Google has just introduced a new information product (which looks like an air freshener)","Positive"
"2971","Not happy. Stopped working 3/2/17.  Wish I could return it.","Positive"
"2972","I like it very much!","Positive"
"2973","The Echo is good for things like playing music (not all, however), weather, measurements, most history information, etc. However, it doesn't know simple things like the calories in Starbucks menu items. To me, Siri is much more useful. Sorry, Alexa...","Positive"
"2974","love it","Positive"
"2975","This is amazing.  We had fun with this in vacation .... nice to have it turn music on or off for you ... it's really a neat gadget and I love it","Positive"
"2976","Getting more intuitive every week.","Positive"
"2977","The Echo is a fun and entertaining device. I can't believe how many things this this device does. The sound quality is fantastic. It's easy to use, and you learn things with it as you use it. I highly recommend it!","Positive"
"2978","Love it.  Use it daily","Positive"
"2979","I bought this item on a whim for a fun gadget. I never expected that it would be as useful as it is. I use this everyday for music, news, and timers for cooking. The speaker in as good as any of the high end brands out there. Due to the ease of use and user friendly app, I am converting my house into a smart home with the extra accessories. In my opinion this is a must have tool for any homeowner.","Positive"
"2980","I purchased this for my husband for Christmas. I love it.","Positive"
"2981","love it!","Positive"
"2982","Love it.  Especially the weather, news and music!","Positive"
"2983","Alexa is great for providing local weather updates.  I asked Alexa if she works for the CIA and has said she doesn't understand the question.  I'm hoping she's not passing along any conversations while she's ""sleeping.""  I talk about my time machine development project and trips to the moon so to entertain Alexa and anyone else that might be listening in Langley, VA <g>.","Positive"
"2984","Favorite purchase of the year and only getting better and better.","Positive"
"2985","This is easily the coolest thing I have ever bought myself. It does so much if you set it up right. It can hear you from across the room with the music blaring. Highly highly recommend!!!","Positive"
"2986","Loved it","Positive"
"2987","I love the Alexa/Echo. I get my weather, news, traffic info. I keep my shopping list, to do lists, etc with Alexa. She plays games with me. I'm still learning and so is Alexa.","Positive"
"2988","I have echo for almost 2 week, and echo gets non responsive. Sometime you keep saying Alexa, but it doesn't responds. Alexa app shows same command in history. Alexa keep dropping network connection while my tv is streaming from amazon or youtube. Not sure if it's a defective piece or what.","Positive"
"2989","So... why only four stars? The range of knowledge to which Alexa has access is surprisingly (and sometimes annoyingly) limited. Yes, she can convert currency, metric equivalents, tell you news, weather, etc. But just today, a friend wanted to test her and asked, ""Who wrote The Great Gatsby?"" Many, many people know the answer to that as it's a literary classic."" Alexa could not come up with F. Scott Fitzgerald and instead of admitting she didn't know, she said ""The History of Things to Come, the dark horizon trilogy by Duncan Simpsin."" Say what??? Each of us asked again, same response. So that's a baffling one. In fact, there are quite a few questions Alexa cannot answer or answers vaguely.","Positive"
"2990","I purchased this system less than ONE month ago and it's already giving me problems. I keep my echo in a safe and secure spot, in an outlet of its own. There's no reason in the world for this system to already stop working. The Echo will acknowledge that I've said ""Alexa,"" as the blue indicator light turns and faces me, but it will not respond to my command. It simply shuts the indiactor light off or, on the rare occasion, it will quickly flash red and turn off. The Echo is connected to a secure and steady network and I've tried signing in and out of the Alexa app with no luck. It has worked perfectly fine up until today. Total waste of money- extremely disappointed.","Positive"
"2991","Found out this was a widespread issue that was quickly resolved. I do greatly enjoy this product when it works. I would give 5 stars if its value wasn't entirely dependent on a system that sometimes doesn't work. I've had an overall pleasant experience with this product.","Positive"
"2992","Loses connection and stops accepting commands since 6 months ago. Before that everything was good, but it has happened too many times since. I'm destroying mine with a hammer/vice/lawn mower and giving up on voice command.","Negative"
"2993","On another note: Amazon has always taken a strong stance on protecting consumer privacy and that deserves a lot of respect. If it was combined with a good device I would probably love it, bit I'm not sure Amazon can handle it. Too much focus on getting the older crowd to like their products and not enough on making good products.","Positive"
"2994","Worked great for a few months, now it hears it's wake word and nothing after that.","Positive"
"2995","Won this thing last week set it up last Friday and seem to be great.. all of a sudden it will not answer a question or even speak at all.. it wakes to the Alexa but that is it.. found this site ...and  everyone is saying they are down..","Positive"
"2996","I have bought two Amazon Echo and had nothing but problems.Apparently there are several KNOWN ISSUES with this device.Support is Terrible unable to talk to IT dept. I love the concept but very unhappy with support. If you would like to buy a device that works contact apple.","Positive"
"2997","I have had the echo for 1 week. At first it was fine. Now when I ask it a question or ask it to play a song etc...it just turns off. I am seriously thinking about returning this.","Positive"
"2998","One of the worst things I've purchased on Amazon. It rarely gets music requests even remotely right.  It absolutely cannot understand the difference in a.m./p.m.  And as of tonight other than lighting up for 3 seconds after saying ""Alexa""  it will shut back down without taking any commands.  Going to get the google version and trash this thing.","Negative"
"2999","great product!!","Positive"
"3000","This thing is a pile of crap.  Haven't even had it a year and its already stopped working.  Just went through three resets to try and get it to work and nothing.  This this is just garbage.  Dont waste your time or money.","Negative"
