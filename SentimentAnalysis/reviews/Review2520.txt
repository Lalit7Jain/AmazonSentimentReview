I have been using advanced technology for the last 20 years.  It was born out of necessity not convenience.  My wife passed away 4 years ago leaving me, not only a widow, but a widowed quadriplegic trying to survive on his own.  We were married 20 years and yes she married me when I was already paralyzed.  She was a beautiful lady here on earth and I am sure she is just as beautiful in God's presence.
