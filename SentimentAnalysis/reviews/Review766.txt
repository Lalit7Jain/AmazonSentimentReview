Amazing. So easy to set up. I just picked it up yesterday and its already controlling my lights and playing one of my spotify playlists while I write this. I have the phillips hue lights already and just waiting for my wemo smart switches (plugs) soon practically everything in my home will be smarter than me. BTW I live in Canada and the only thing I haven't been able to set was my route to work for traffic. No big deal though I can ask her to play my local traffic station through tuneIn which is much better anyway. .
