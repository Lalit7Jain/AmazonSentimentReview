This is the greatest thing I have ever purchased and I mean that!  It controls my lights, it does my grocery list, it plays any and all songs I ask it to.  This device should be much more expensive than it is. I should be a rep for Alexa.  I have had numerous friends purchase it in the last few days since I have received mine in the mail.  Control your AC? Check.  Control your Sprinklers? Check.  Since it's connected to the internet you can ask it anything.  My kids use it to help them with their homework.  BUY IT!!!!!!!
