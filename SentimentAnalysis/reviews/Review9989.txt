I am really enjoying my Echo product. I have a friend at work that keeps asking me why do I need it when I have my phone (Siri) that essentially does the same thing. I tell him it's so much more. Much more convenient (to me) and it keeps getting better. The only way to truly justify this type of technology is to "just use it!". Even if you ask it the most inane of questions, you are using it. Great product.
