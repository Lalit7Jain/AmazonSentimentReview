Love the echo and find it quite useful for those of us with failing memories.  Bought a second one as a gift for a dear friend.  Since it was a gift I paid the extra $3.99 to have it gift wrapped.  Big mistake a total was of $3.99.  Amazon's idea of gift wrapping is a colored box sealed with scotch tape.  Save your $4
