We gpot thus for Xmas, had great fun with it the first day. It recognized our commands instantly, we installed games and listened to music. The volume was great, the music coyuld fill up a large room. Then today, the second we ever used it, it stopped hearing our commands, the music volume is really soft where as the Alexa voice is able to be turned way up to 10 or down, the music stays at about 3. Very uphappy with this happening after one day, no accidents, no reason this expensive thing shouldn't continue to work well like it did yesterday.
