This is a very exciting technology which is kind of nice to have in your house for about $150.00.  It plays music upon request.  It answers questions upon request.  I am sure that it does many other functions; many of which I have yet to explore.  But if you purchase it, be aware that it doesn't understand everything.  Complicated words and unusual questions are beyond its ability to understand; and restating the question doesn't always help.  If you buy this nifty device, be aware of these shortcomings.
