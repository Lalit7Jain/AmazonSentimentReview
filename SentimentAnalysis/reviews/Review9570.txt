I have had this thing two and a half months after October. After following the instructions, I played with her to test her out. Sometimes she didn't understood some requests I ask from her. But each she did or did not understand any of my request, I would go to my alexa app and click on yes or no I'm the card. Apparently, over time, she is beginning to understand me better and more whenever I ask for a request, such as playing music, buying some songs I like, playing rock, paper, scissors and reading one of my kindle books. So, overall while it and it's skill are a working progress, it is still something worth trying out. If you like the amazon echo, please don't hesitate to but it.
