Love love love!!! I want one in every room!! So much fun!! And so convenient! I ask her to play a certain kind of music and it's like she is reading my mind. I love her skills. When I first get up in the morning when I'm still groggy I like to ask about weather and news to get my brain running as I'm getting up and then I ask for my music.  It is so advance that I can't believe I waited so long to get one. Awesome looking too! Easy to setup! Get one now!!! I'm ready to buy another for the bathroom... it will solve my problem of having to dry off my hand to skip a song I don't want to listen to! Lol I love accessories and they already bought some!
