This thing does not understand a southern accent.  No matter how many apps I upload and enable,  This thing can rarely find any of the requests I put to it. I still cannot get it to connect to my Prime Music. Other than giving you a Chuck Norris fact and a slow to update weather report, it is pretty much useless.  I'm sorry I bought it.
