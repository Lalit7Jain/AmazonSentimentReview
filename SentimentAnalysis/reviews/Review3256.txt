Simply doesn't work as advertised. It can't hear me when there's music playing. It defaults to Amazon Music unless I specifically say "play Spotify" and even that was spotty at best. I asked it to play an album from Spotify that was in my collection and downloaded and it still played "samples" of the artist from Amazon. It also can't answer what I consider relatively simple questions that it should be able to search and find. I just don't think the technology is there yet, and certainly not for the price.
