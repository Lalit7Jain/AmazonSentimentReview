It used to work well for about 8 months. Out of the blue for the past 2 months both of my original Echo devices started controlling the Hue lights whenever they felt like. It takes a very long time to process a command and it might say "device not responding" and not do anything, or it might actually turn off, or dim, some, but not all, of the lights about 10 to 20 seconds later. And even some times it works just fine. I tried rediscovery and restarting everything from Echo to router to Hue bridge but nothing fixes the problem for good. Right after discovery it might work for half an hr but then it doesn't. I tried calling Amazon support but it was totally unhelpful. They have no clue other than saying reset this or that. The lady went off saying that if Alexa is more than 30 feet away from the device it might not be able to control it. I guess she has never heard of strong wifi signals or repeaters. Then she claimed that the Prime account holder was my wife and the device was registered under my account, as if a Prime account is needed for this function. I tried telling her that it was irrelevant as long as the devices were "discovered" on the "profile" being used but she got mad because I wasn't buying her nonsense and hung up on me. The fact is that it has some bugs that need to be addressed.  The Hue app works all the time on both Apple and Android devices. I suspect there is a problem with the way Alexa tries to communicate with the Hue Bridge. It might be the same story with other devices but I don't know since I don't have other.
