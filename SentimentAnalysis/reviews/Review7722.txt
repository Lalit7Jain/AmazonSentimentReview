So let me get this straight?...I need to download the Alexa App--which is an Apple supported function---Yet, I cannot import my iTunes library??? When I ask Alexa to play a song, I get a SAMPLE, and not the entire song!? I am EXTREMELY Disappointed! Furthermore...it answered questions great---for about a day.  I just set Alexa up Aamir six hours ago. It was working great. Now everything I ask her, I'm getting the standard hon I did not understand the question I was asked" as a response. Are you kidding me? Such a Let down!!  Not nearly as helpful or accurate as it is on the commercial. Will likely return both Alexa AND the Dot, for this reason!
