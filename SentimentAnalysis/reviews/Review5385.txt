I love my echo. I listen to it every morning and night. I'm thinking of taking it to work with me! I take it from room to room. Especially like to listen to relaxation station to fall asleep. And when I am soaking in the bath I like piano music. I listen to artists I have heard of but never got to hear their music. Over the holidays, one night I listened to White Christmas by 12 different singers.  Alexa understands me very well and it doesn't take long to catch on to  how to phrase questions so she understands.
