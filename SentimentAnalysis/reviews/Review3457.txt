This has got to be the coolest home electronic EVER!  I purchased it for my husband for Christmas and the entire family loves it.  Now I need to look into purchasing another one because he has taken it to his office and we are left at home without Alexa.  We also received a "google Home" thing that does sortof the same thing, but I can never get it to do what I want and my husband likes Alexa because it is louder and has much better sound quality.  My 6 year old set the entire thing up (electronics scare me and I hate fighting with things that don't work out) - he just opened the box, plugged it in and we were in business.  It's a lot like Siri -you can ask just about anything and it's quite entertaining.  Shortly after our first time using it I didn't know how to turn it off.  We just say, "Alexa turn yourself off" and it does.  It's great!  LOL  Very highly recommend getting an Echo - best familiy addition ever!
