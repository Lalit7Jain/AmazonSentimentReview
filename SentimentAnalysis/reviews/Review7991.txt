When it responds to my voice it acts as described. But there are many times the top ring lights up showing it identifies that I requested an action but then does not execute my commands often it fails to two or three requests. when I push the attention button on the top of the unit it has always worked. I have tried training the unit to my voice which helped a little bit. I like the product but I find it frustrating at times. I would still buy it but I am not fully satisfied with it.
