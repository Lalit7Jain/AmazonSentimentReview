I received this as a gift.  This same year my son got a google home.  Saying Alexa is more personable.  That is where the Eco stops at being better.  I dont care what you call it.  I dont care about how you spell it.  It is crap.  Play a youtube video, NO.  Play a certain song, NO.  Songs you can play?  Google home has a better speaker.  I really doubt this review will stay alive on Amazon.  Why?  I have bought crap that I was like, "this sucks. How did this get any reviews let alone the above 80% I require.  This current review is just a test.  There is no way this product should be release to the public.
