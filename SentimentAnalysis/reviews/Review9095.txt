I love my Echo. Echo is a must have for the modern home.  In my house we use it to listen to music, play games, help with homework, and get recipes, I also use it for some of the features in my smarthome system with Vivint.  I wish I could do more than just play music on my smart phone.  A calling or texting feature would be really cool.  Nevertheless, I happy I finally purchased an Echo and I love introducing my guests to Alexa.
