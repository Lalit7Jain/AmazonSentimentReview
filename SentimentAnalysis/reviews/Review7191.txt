I bought Alexa in December, 2016. My overall experience with the technology was negative. Alexa fails to answer relatively simple and frequent queries, such as "what is the score of the MN Vikings game" or "which NFL quarterback has the most passing yards this year?" In each case, Alexa would respond with "Hmmm...I cannot find an answer to that question" After about a week, I was irritated enough to return the device. I found the ability to instruct Alexa to play music to be far better. Apparently Alexa is based on the Bing search engine, which is widely regarded as inferior relative to Google. I don't recommend the product.
