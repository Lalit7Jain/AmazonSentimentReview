I enjoy playing music from my Pandora and iHeart accounts. It's a great speaker. However, I don't like the fact that I have to call out a "skill" for every question I ask. Im so tired of hearing "I can't find the answer to that question."  So I have to get out my Alexa app to find the skill so I can ask Alexa to ask the skill the question. It's much easier to just Google it, which she won't do.
