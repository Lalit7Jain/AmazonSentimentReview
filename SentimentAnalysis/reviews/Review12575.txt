Alexa has been a great addition to me house. I've had Alexa since they first came out (preordered). I use Alexa everyday, listening to music, turning off and on the lights (I also have the Wink), using the timer for cooking. I hike 7 days a week and I ask Alexa the weather almost everyday in the summer and in the winter for ski season. I love that I can be in the kitchen and use the lay of something and let Alexa know, and it's put on my shopping list. There's really nothing I can think of that's negative about Alexa. I have the Alexa Dot and another one on the way. So handy and fun to have in the house and very useful at the same time.
