Excellent music source!! I've been looking for a good music system for my living room for quite a while now .not that I couldn't find one but it had to be right for both me and the wife..me: floor to ceiling speakers with a sub..wife: something small that she can't see ..me: a speaker in ever corner...wife: 1...that she can't see ...…i needed something that could play different media iPod, SD card, CD's Internet radio , USB port..I have a very good Phillips radio that could do most of those things and had pretty good sound..but the sound was just coming from one place ..so I hooked up some external speakers and a mini sub and I was happy.." I was happy" the wife? Not so much! And I was about to add a speaker selector and expand into the dining room'...(you can just imagine her reaction!) I've been looking at the echo for a while but I thought it was limited cause my main music source is my iPod and it has no imports.....when it went on sale for black Friday for $139.00 I figure what the heck I'll give it a try...I took down everything and gave it to my youngest son ( mistake!) And waited for my echo. When it came I set it up and have been in love every since...the fact that it can stream from multiple sources prime, Pandora, ect. And I solved my iPod problem via Bluetooth transmitter (Brightech-Brightplay - Amazon $16.89) & I can upload 250 of my personal music to prime ...you can add a lot more for a price' as for the sound I think its pretty impressive for such a small speaker and the fact that it has 360' sound no matter what room I'm in I get a good listing experience.. Some reviews say its not as good as a Bose , or other high end speaker and its not.... but you don't pay $140 and get high end you get damn good! I already have a fire stick so I have a good ideal what Alexa can do...but now that I have echo I WILL be adding light switches and outlets! I've ordered a "Echo Dot" for my patio aka "man cave" where I have my "really good speakers"!and NO WIFE!
