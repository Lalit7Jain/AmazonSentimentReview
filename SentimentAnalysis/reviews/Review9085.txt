This issue tends to get a bit irritating until I realize that I'm the  stupid one for yelling at the dam thing for repeatedly getting it wrong.  Also, I'm wondering when will Amazon allow us to name the device what ever name we choose???  Last I heard, Echo and Alexa aren't exactly the most popular names around.  Kind of takes the fun out of the device when there is no other name options.
