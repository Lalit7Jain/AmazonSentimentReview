I cannot say how much I enjoy this speaker. I have taught my grandmother how to check the local weather with it, granted she calls Lexi, Alexis, and other similar names. I have to remind her it is Alexa, lol. In all seriousness though I find this to be wonderful. It has many features that I know and many more that I learn as time goes on. Great idea for many people for the holiday. I especially like how accurate it pulls information. I would recommend this for someone with bad eyesight to enjoy things like fast weather updates, and many more things as it expands.
