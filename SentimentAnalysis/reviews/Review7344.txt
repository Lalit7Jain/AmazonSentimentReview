I've had my Echo for about a month and I have to say that Alexa is fun to have around. I use her to wake me up (Alec Baldwin does it actually); instead of picking my phone up I ask her the time; she reads me the news while I do other things; she'll tell me what's on my calendar for tomorrow; and she plays music when I ask her to and she helps me get to sleep with relaxing night sounds. Usually she understands what I'm asking of her, even if she can't always answer. It'd be very nice if she could read emails and text messages, and there are some other skills that would be enjoyable. Oddly, my wife uses Alexa even more than I do. All in all, she's very, very nice to have around and well worth the investment.
