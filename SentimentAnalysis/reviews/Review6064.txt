So happy with the echo, and all it can do, the speakers are amazing for no bigger than it is.  We love using it, makes shopping a lot easier with the shopping list.  Had trouble with the app opening on my phone, but after going to the help site it was an easy fix.  Now no more leaving my list at home.  Husband has TD Ameritrade and his weather, and I have everything else.
