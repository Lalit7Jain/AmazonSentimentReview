I remember when I first got the Echo it was mainly a tool for an inquisitive mind. I wanted to push the Echo to see what it could and couldn't answer, but it has quickly cemented its place as a central piece of our house. Also, we've decided to make the Echo more seasonal. I wouldn't recommend it for the acoustics, but it is hilarious.
