I was really excited about this when we first ordered it... The idea of hands free! Wow!!!! here's the problem, they built this around Bing, the worst search engine on the internet. It's good for playing music and that is about it. If you purchase you should familiarize yourself with the following phrase "I'm sorry I don't know the answer to that". If it were really good at playing music I may have given it three stars but it is not. A lot of songs you would want to listen to are not available for free and because echo works off bing and not google, it can't play youtube audio content. The device often interrupts you when you're trying to request a song and says "here's a station you might like" and just like a used car salesperson it offers something that indeed you would not like - for example; dora the explorrer songs..? wtf?
