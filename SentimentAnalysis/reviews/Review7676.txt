Updated: With a little lateral thinking I was able to get my Echo device to actually work. I had to use a second router to create a second, WPA, network in my house. This is not ideal, and it requires the use of another router, but I am not able to use the device without any real limitation. I am currently giving the device 3 stars. It would be really nice if the Alexa App would indicate in some way that you are entering a password for a network type that is not supported by the Echo device. That alone would have saved me a ton of time and frustration. Amazon's help pages should also make it clearer that the device is not compatible with certain common network types.
