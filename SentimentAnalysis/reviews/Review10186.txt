I have an Echo Dot and bought the Big Echo because of the sea price and also I needed built in sound.. the Echo has fabulous sound!!  I play a variety of music from Country to Smooth jazz and this echo has fantastic sound!  I set it up in my living room and it it fills the Kitchen and dining room with beautiful sound.. thats about 950sq/ft.. if you have high ceilings and more than 1000 sq ft.. then you may need a higher powered speaker system.  If you already have a good system that can connect with Bluetooth then thats the way to go.. I love the sound quality.. I listened to many BT speakers to see if there was another that I would like better.. reality is.. for the money the Echo is fantastic!!  If the echo isn't enough then you need to connect to a high end stereo or Home theater system.  I have a 7.1 sound bar for my 4k TV and the Echo sounds better alone than when I connect it to play through the sound bar..  It wont get as loud as my 700 watt system  but the quality is better from the internal speakers.. If I have a party then I will go for the higher volume in on the sound bar.. but let me tell you.. I listened to Sonos..he JBL the BOSE... and it only the BOSE came close to the built in sound quality of the echo!  I would have to spend another $200 to get just a little better than what echo delivers!  Try it for yourself!  You can always return it.. I doubt you will !!  I am giving this as a gift to all my friends for Christmas.. they will love it.. I will get one for my office as well..  I hope they keep expanding the capabilities !!
