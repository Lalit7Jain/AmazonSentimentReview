This is my second echo that didn't work.  After an hour on the phone, they sent me a RMA and this new Echo.  After another hour with customer service, I couldn't get this one to work either.  This really sucked because I bought it for my husband for Valentine's Day and he was very excited about it.  Now no echo in this household.  We spent 3 hours trying to get both to work only to give up and call customer support and spend the additional two hours. My call was escalated only to be told that the issue was my router and that i needed to email Netgear, then call them back, change my router settings, etc... That isn't going to happen.  I'm going to change my router settings that all other devices haven't an issue with for a product that is nothing more than a toy? I already wasted too much time on this.  I asked for a refund.
