One improvement I'd like to see would be adding a separate setting for Alexa's voice and separate for music (this will make sense if you have used Alexa). We often listen to music over dinner at a low volume, then ask Alexa a question--she answers at the same volume the music was set at. It would be great if her voice could have a separate volume control in a setting preference so she could be heard over background music that is being played low (for example, we are listening to music, then say, "Alexa, what is the temperature outside." She answers the temperature in the same volume as the music, which is too low to hear her (it?) but is a good volume to hear "dinner music" at. Maybe this can be changed in a future version or added to her many skills! Overall, we love it (her?) and plan to add dots and integrate some smart home features.
