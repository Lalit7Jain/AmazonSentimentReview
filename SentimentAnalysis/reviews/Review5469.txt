If you have any trouble with this Idem. (((((Return it!!!!!!)))) What Amazon does not tell you is.  Echo has trouble with Att U-Verse Wi- Fi. Hours to FIX. With my Echo it was back ordered. The Echo Amazon sent me was not up to date with the soft wear . What a nightmare..... I have to say when it works it's great. I also so have a Echo Dot and I got a Dot for my mother ( not hooked up yet ) The Dot so fair works good ( Bad sound) With my Big Echo I have packed it up and will return it. A replacement is on back order and I will get it at the end of the month. (3 weeks) I can just hope I get a new up dated ECHO and not one that old and out dated.
