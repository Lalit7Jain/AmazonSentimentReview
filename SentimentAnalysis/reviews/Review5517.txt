"I'll have to find out more about that" is our Echo's favorite answer.  It seems to know about Abraham Lincoln, but may of the other things we ask about it just does not have an answer for.  It also has trouble with female voices.  It does work great as a DJ, although if you aren't specific enough you get some odd selections of music.  In general it seems like more of a novelty than a useful tool.
