I want to like Alexa, I really do. It's great for playing music, and has a few other nifty features. The problem is Alexa is really bad at hearing you correctly. She does the wrong thing, and then I log into the app and see what she thinks she heard me say, and it is wrong. Amazon really needs to spend a little more time developing their voice recognition software before this will really work.
