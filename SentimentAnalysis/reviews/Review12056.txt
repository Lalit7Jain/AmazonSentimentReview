- I can only control one to do list and one shopping list.  I use Google Keep for my lists and Outlook for my calendar.  And my husband and I share a google account in addition, so that we can keep joint lists in Keep.  She should be able to interface with that.  I think this is a major handicap.  I realize Amazon wants you to use everything Amazon...but this is why PC's became better than Apple computers.  You can't be an isolationist.  People don't want to switch over all their apps to Amazon supported ones.
