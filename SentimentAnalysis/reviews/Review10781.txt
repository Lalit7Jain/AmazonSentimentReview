She is good, but she can be better. I wish there are more things I can do with my Echo without having to spend more money. If you are wealthy and can afford the extra toys that the Echo can play with then the Echo is a great investment. However if you can only afford this particular Echo then it is going to be a good purchase, but not a great one.
