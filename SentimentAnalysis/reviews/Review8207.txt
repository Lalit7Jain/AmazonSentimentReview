I've had the Echo for a few weeks now--and I'm returning it. While the voice recognition technology is the best I've ever used, as an intelligent assistant the Echo seems less capable than Apple's Siri (surprising, at least to me). Basic things that you expect to work, don't (playlist operations, settings management, fine-grained volume control, MS Exchange integration). You'll find yourself having to go to the Alexa app (awful). Worse, the device has become unresponsive twice in the two weeks I've had it, which is not acceptable if you use it as an alarm.
