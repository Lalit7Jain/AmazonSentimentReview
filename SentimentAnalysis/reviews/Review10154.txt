OMG... how did we get along without Alexa? She is so helpful (and at times so funny). She tells us the weather for the day and the week ahead. She answers questions that frequently pop into our heads (i.e. Alexa, when did So-and-So die? Alexa, what is the capital city of ....?). She orders items from Amazon when we realize we need a replacement. She plays our Prime music for us and her speakers are great. She gives us information on restaurants, etc. She even says good-night to us... haha. She'll sing, tell jokes and give us the news of the day in our Flash Briefing. I cannot imagine life without our Echo. Recently we bought the Dot to go in our family room downstairs... that's how much we love these devices.
