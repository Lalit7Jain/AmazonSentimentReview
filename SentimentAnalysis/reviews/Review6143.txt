After receiving the echo I got it all hooked up and started using it right away. It seemed fine but shortly into using it within hours I noticed it wasn't doing as asked. Music would play for a short moment then stop. It wouldn't answer questions. I wrote on the wall that was available for questions and spoke to friends who have it. I was told to do a variety of steps and also was told if your Wi-Fi is not strong you will have issues. We are in a country setting and Wi-Fi isn't as great as it could be sometimes so I decided to return it. I was not sure what to do and didn't want to have troubles all the time like that. It was just too expensive to take a chance.
