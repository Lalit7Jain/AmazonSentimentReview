I was so impressed with the speaker performance of the Echo that I'm trying Amazon Music. It just sounds fantastic. So far I have been able to find all except 2 songs I requested (out of about 20). 1 was a live performance so that's understandable, and the other was by a lesser-known band. Overall I'm very happy with the music selection. The volume controls are great, so convenient. And I have to say again, the audio quality is AMAZING. I was not holding my breath, because the echo is so small. So I was very pleasantly surprised.
