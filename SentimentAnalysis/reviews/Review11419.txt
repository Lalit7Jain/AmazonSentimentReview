Thing failed in less than 2 years and Amazon is like sorry buy a new one!  After spending an hour on the phone with technical support, they are all this happens and we would replace it but you bought it when they first came out and now it is out of warranty.  I talked to the manager and he told me "if I would have used it more it may have failed sooner!"  Unbelievable!  So not like Amazon, I basically have a $200 dollar paper weight!
