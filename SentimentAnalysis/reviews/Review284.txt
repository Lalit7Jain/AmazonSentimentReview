This thing is a joke. Doesn't understand what I say. After I give it a command, the blue light stays lit for an additional 10 seconds. It doesn't have the answering technology that Googles device has. It disappears from the device menu on spotify constantly. Do not waste your money on this. Amazon is more concerned with adding stupid "skills" like pet jokes rather than addressing important issues. Buy Googles device.
