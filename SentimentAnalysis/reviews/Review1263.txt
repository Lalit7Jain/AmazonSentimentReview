I love ECHO!!!! I originally bought it for just playing my music but it has come to be so much more. I use the alarm feature frequently to remind me to check what I'm cooking or that my favorite show is starting soon. Checking the weather is easy as can be. Getting the daily news from my favorite station is very convenient. I even have an app that will text my close friend that I'm hurt and need to be helped. I love checking on the status of my orders from Amazon (my favorite place to shop!). The shopping list function is great for remembering what I need to buy at the grocery so I don't have to search for pen and paper to write it down before I forget. I also have a list of things to remember like calls to make or  that my cat needs to visit the vet. These are just a few examples. There are so many apps available that I'm still finding new uses for Echo every week. I highly recommend this useful device and not just for music, although it's worth it if only used for that purpose. Great sound quality.
