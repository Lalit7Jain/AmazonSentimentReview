I've also found that the Little Bear P5-1 (which is a Musical Fidelity X-10D clone) is a great addition to the Dot when connecting via the 3.5mm miniplug.  It really adds a greater sound stage, while smoothing out the digital edge.  Again--I'm a believer, as I already own 4 Dots and 3 of these in-line valve buffers.
