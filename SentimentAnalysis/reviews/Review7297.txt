I had already had an Echo since the beginning of the "beta" testing for consumers. This particular one was a gift for a very non-techy couple. I set it up for them and they LOVE it. They even purchased Prime, because they mostly wanted the music. I'm not sure they will use it to its full potential, maybe on each of my visits I'll teach them a little more.
