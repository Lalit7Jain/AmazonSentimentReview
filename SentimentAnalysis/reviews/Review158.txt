Bought this as a gift for our son. Chose this item as a gift because we received an Echo (Alexa) as our own gift this past Christmas. I'm still learning about the range of things this electronic can do. So far, the most important thing Alexa can do for us is read books for my husband who is blind. The device remembers his books and picks up right where he stopped listening last. The next most important task that she performs is music ... when she is not reading she plays jazz tunes for us. I also like that Alexa can start a timer (for cooking purposes) even while playing music. (This girl can even multitask!! ha)
