Overall, I really like the Amazon Echo.  It has some real utility that I am sure I will use more over time.  I have not used all of its features yet.  For example, you can purchase add-ons for the Echo that enable you to control lights and appliances with voice commands which I have not tried yet.  But I anticipate I will do so at some point in the future.
