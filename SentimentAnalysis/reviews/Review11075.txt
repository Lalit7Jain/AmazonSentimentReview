Amazon Echo is a great device and I loved it and used often while it worked.  Then one day it decided it was not going to connect to my internet anymore.  I called echo support and after numerous trouble shooting ideas it was determined that the problem was my router!  Really?!  Between myself and my family and friends there has been almost 100 devices hooked up to my wifi and not a single one ever had trouble connecting.  My echo won't connect and it's my router's fault?!  They refuse to refund my money or send me a new one and I refuse to pay for one when the first one worked for a little over a year (just long enough to void the warranty).  It's a great device but not for $200/yr.  So good luck when you purchase one and hope that it never decides to stop connecting to your wifi, because once it does you will be the proud owner of a $180+tax paper weight.  Also shame on Amazon for not standing by their product.  I don't think it would bankrupt them if they had to replace their own faulty devices.  BUYER BEWARE!
