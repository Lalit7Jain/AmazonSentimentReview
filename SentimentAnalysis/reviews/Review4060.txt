This has lots of nice features, but if you have children, beware! There are no parental controls.  Alexa will play whatever it THINKS it is asked.  The other day, my 3 & 5 year old asked it to play a song. What started playing was a vulgar comedy routine that included swear words a comments about rape. I brought this up to a customer service rep whose response was "did you listen to you utterance history?" As if that might have been what they were looking for?  And even if you assumed they said something that sounded like whatever that content was, there is no way to keep that from playing. You cannot prohibit explicit content for any reason. The rep finally admitted the device not for kids. Should I just get rid of them so I can enjoy my Echo?  Anyway, I turned it off and will likely return or give to someone without kids.
