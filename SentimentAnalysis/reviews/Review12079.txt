I think the Echo is a good product and can help a lot around the house for many people. The reason I gave it 3 stars is the commercials are very misleading. If you watch them they act as if you plug it into the wall and your whole house is magically voice controlled in minutes. The truth is you really need to hire an electrician to change a ton of outlets, mess with the electrical panel, replace almost all your bulbs, and buy about $600 worth of accessories to make it do all the at fun stuff. After all of that is done, it will take a few hours of programming your wink/alexa to your phone and putting in the product codes for each product you want connected. Once all that is done then yes it's pretty cool.
