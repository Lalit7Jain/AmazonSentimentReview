I love my Alexa. She plays great music for free with no ads and has great sound... BUT, she does not come with a remote any longer like the original pre-order ones initially food and she doesn't work with Slacker Radio that I subscribe to... Overall, great product, but could be better if you brought back including the remote and add in support for Slacker Radio.
