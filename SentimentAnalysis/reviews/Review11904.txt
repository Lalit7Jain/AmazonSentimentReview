Well... It's hard to say. This product was sort of in the middle, but it was more on the bad side. Instead of this I could have bought a weather clock for 20 dollars. It can only reply to several questions. It can tell you the weather, or it can play just about any AM or FM radio station. The only catch is that it has to be phrased in only a certain way for it to understand you. If you ask it to set a timer or an alarm, it will, but most of the time it gets the wrong time. If you ask the time, it will tell you. We recently got a dog. The name was somewhat close to "Alexa", the default name for the echo. We weren't so surprised when it started waking up every time we said the dog's name. We changed the name to "Echo", but then it woke up to both "Echo" and the dog's name. We changed it to the only other name available, but no matter what, it woke up to anything. It's too late to return it, but I definitely wouldn't recommend anyone to buy it.
