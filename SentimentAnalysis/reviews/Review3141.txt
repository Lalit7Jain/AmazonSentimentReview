She can tell me if a store is currently open and when they close. If they aren't yet open, she will tell me what time they will open. However, she can not tell me what the store hours are for tomorrow. I don't understand why not. This is irritating because if the store is already open when I ask her, she won't tell me what the opening time is. She will say "the store is currently open". So I don't know when they would open tomorrow based on any info I can get from her. And if we are talking  about "tomorrow" being a Sunday, the store might not even be open so that is info I would like to know.
