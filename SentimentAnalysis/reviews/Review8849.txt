We love our echo. We use it to control our home automation controller (Vera Edge), and it works great. Additionally, the streaming music selection through prime music and pandora is great. With new features being added all the time, it is a great buy. The only slight improvement that Amazon could make would be to set better "Alexa" recognition at higher volume levels.
