I think if you live on your own, Echo is a must! such a great addition to my home, I've since purchased a few of the dots too. Good sound from speaker, I use this instead of a sonos in the office, but with Alexa it feels like anything is possible, I think it would lie good for a couple, but I do question when more that two people, if it can work out voice recognition or some added security so everyone can't activate it then Amazon are on to an all time winner. Will use Alexa any day over Siri. Always important to remember that there is no screen like Siri, it really is a marvel it what it can do. Always new stuff to discover and added to the Echo eco system, so a great long term investment.
