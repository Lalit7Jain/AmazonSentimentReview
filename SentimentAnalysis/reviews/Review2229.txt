Oh, so cool, but this toy is a true "CRITTER CAM" when paired with your iPhone, wireless network, and everything spoken with earshot of "Alexa" - All fed real-time to Amazon and its vendor partners, and whoever else might be listed in the multipage privacy agreement - and subsequent updates to it.. Very cool to most, but for me the scope of privacy intrusion is beyond anything I've even imagined. Alexa, I think I can manage well without you.
