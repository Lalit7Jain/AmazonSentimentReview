Just got the Echo a week ago and already am in LOVE with it!  Just her ability to play music for me by Artist, genre, song, etc is amazing!  She comes up with GREAT playlists! But that only scratches the surface of what she can do!  I can ask her the weather when I'm getting dressed - or who is singing the current song.  It does take a little more effort to get her to find you recipes, etc but you can 'train' her and yourself to use the right commands and learn how to ask for what you want..I can see this really exploding on the market very soon...and it's A LOT of fun to show her off when people come over..Not to mention this was an excellent deal - the Refurbished one comes with the same warranty as the brand new one - only $60 cheaper!..I haven't purchased the outlets yet to control my home but Xmas IS coming:)....
