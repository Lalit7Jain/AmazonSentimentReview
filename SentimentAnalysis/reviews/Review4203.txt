Really have enjoyed my new Echo. I have only had it for 1 month now but ,it really is a fun and practical tool.There are quite a bit of tasks or skills that can be enabled,far too many to mention here.The complete list is available on Amazon,and also through the Alexa App.That list seems to grow weekly and it's a lot of fun to check out Alexa's new skills.So far she has been very reliable.The Echo's sound is really amazing for this compact of a unit.I would definately recommend Echo to anyone.
