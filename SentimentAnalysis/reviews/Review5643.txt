Oh my gosh, I LOVE this thing! It's a lot of fun. I ordered a smaller Echo Dot for my office at work, too. Speaker sound on the Echo is pretty good - But not stereo, of course. (That's the only downside to playing music). Have tried it with the switches for turning on/off lamp, and that works pretty well. Sometimes, I have to tell Alexa more than once to turn on the light, but overall it works. We also got a Rachio sprinkler controller, but haven't hooked that up yet. Some of the Alexa Skills are pretty entertaining. ("Skills" are like Apps for Echo). It's also useful for various questions it can answer without having to invoke a special Skill. Always try just asking the question first. If she can't answer it, try wikipedia skill for it, such as "Alexa, Wikipedia [topic]" That often finds me information she couldn't otherwise get. If that fails, too, see if there's a Skill for what you need. For example, there is a Skill for calculating fractions that works "okay" for helping your kids with their homework. I asked it this morning who's playing NFL football today, and it gave me the playoff schedule for today, including the game times (in my own time zone). It will define words and give synonyms, tell you the time anywhere in the world, set timers and alarms, and answer a variety of random questions. Saves me time looking things up. It will also add things to a shopping list for you, or to a To Do list. I'm very happy with this purchase!
