Works as advertised except is not very good at searching the internet for information. I thought I would be able to ask it questions and it would look them up on the internet for me. If I had not already purchased this I would consider getting the new Google device instead. However overall I do like this product. The speaker is good and I like that it links to my Amazon music account. I also find the app on my cell phone to be somewhat cumbersome. I hope they continue to work on the software. Specifically I would like to see more options to organize my tasks and shopping lists.
