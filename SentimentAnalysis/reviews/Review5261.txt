For what ever reason - product update or failing electronics - my two year old Echo quit connecting to wireless.  All operations trying to reset the device came to a crawl.  The device may have not been built to last more then two years but at $200 I would expect more.  Stuck now with a door stop I guess.  Have several Echo Dots which I think are a better investment if the devices will only last 2 years.
