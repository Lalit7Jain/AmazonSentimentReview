Like it but after a few months it stopped working because it was defective.  Amazon sent new one but did not include a power adapter (i sent mine back with the defective one) so its useless.Looks like it doesn't come with a power adapter and you have to buy that separately now.What kind of idiota sells an electric device without including the required power cord?
