The shopping list and to-do list functions are great, but the search functions leave a lot to be desired. Basic search requests, like "when was "insert famous person's name" born?" are likely to return a "hmm, I don't know how to answer that question". Rephrasing the question generally does not help. Others, such as asking how to say something in another language, return "I don't know how to say that, but.." and then it gives you the written phrase on your phone, which defeats the purpose of having the voice interface. Also, if Alexa doesn't quite understand the question, and gets a lot of possible answers, you have to look at your phone to see the list of possibilities, again defeating the purpose of the voice interface. Finally, I would like to be able to use a search engine besides Bing. You cannot even tell the device to Search Google. Now I see Google has come out with their own device, and I am little sorry I didn't wait. The Google device is cheaper too.
