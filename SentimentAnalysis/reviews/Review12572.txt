Alexa is awesome! It is a great addition to our household, we use it mainly to play music for the kids, love the kids station from Prime. It makes a lot of things easier -- shopping lists, timer, math calculations, games the kids enjoy (helps my first grader with her Math). However, there is still room for improvement -- i.e. when we ask it to play a certain song using the same prompt, sometimes it gets it and plays a full free version from Prime Music, but sometimes it doesn't and just plays a short sample. Sometimes it doesn't hear very well. But we still love having it around that I am not taking away stars because it constantly updates and improves. LOVE IT!!!!
