Love it, just having the music abilities is worth it! I have a prime membership ..meaning i have free music.. great speaker sound,fits perfectly with the kids tablets and fire tv..alexa's abilities are limited but growing and the kids like talking to it..it does alot more....weather,news,jokes,horoscopes,find my phone,control of it from my cell phone,ordering stuff but I mainly use it for the music.
