I took a chance on this product based on two things, the wonderful reviews and it was on sale. I wasn't expecting much but I have to say I was very happy with what it does. It is very helpful around the house. I love being able to ask for almost any song ( with amazon prime) anytime one pops in my head. I love the shopping list feature. I love the calendar feature. I love the weather, traffic, timer features. Every week we find something new this little sucker does. If you don't have one yet you should get one.
