What did I ever do before Alexa? She is my new BFF. I doubt I have discovered everything she can do, but I absolutely love that I can just speak and have her play music for me. That is great when I am cleaning house, cooking or in bed. I can have her add items to my shopping list as soon as I think of them, so no more forgetting things I need. We play games together, she can tell me what the temperature is, how to get stains out of clothing, what time a show comes on and so much more. She doesn't always understand what I say or hear me as well as advertised, but I still like her. Also, if an Amazon Echo commercial comes on TV, be prepared for her to listen when her name is said. That also happened with another commercial that had a child named Alexa. The dad said the name a few times, making my Echo keep trying to respond. It was funny. The only downside is that my teenage daughter wants to use Alexa all of the time. She calls Alexa my robot. Too bad she can't vacuum the floor. Since we love her so much, I have also purchased Alexa's little sister, Dot, for my daughter. It's to be a Christmas present so sssshhhhh!! It will be our little secret. Make yourself or someone else happy. Buy an Echo...or two.
