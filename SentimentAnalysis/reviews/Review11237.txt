Sound quality is better than a small desktop radio but definitely not high quality.  I previously was using a small desktop bose system and Echo doesn't stand up to that quality of sound.  The sound quality is clear enough but not crisp in any of the low/mid/high ranges.  It would be nice if there was a clock on the device or the ability to wave your hand over it and have it do a default action (tell the time, start the radio, etc)  but I understand that they are going for a minimalist look.  The volume ring adjustment at the top is a great feature.
