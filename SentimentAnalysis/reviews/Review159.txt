I bought this item on a whim for a fun gadget. I never expected that it would be as useful as it is. I use this everyday for music, news, and timers for cooking. The speaker in as good as any of the high end brands out there. Due to the ease of use and user friendly app, I am converting my house into a smart home with the extra accessories. In my opinion this is a must have tool for any homeowner.
