Everything you want to do has to be done by an "app".  Like I said, I don't live on a cell phone, so for me it's to the computer.  They are making the Google version of Echo look so much better.  If this thing doesn't improve quickly I'm giving it away and taking the tax write off.  I never thought I'd curse at an inanimate object, but this have given me cause.
