The Alexa App needs to have a better search engine behind it. It's fine for shopping but for most questions, Alexa has no answer, defaulting to "I don't uanderstand" or something in that manner. Ask Alexa "how long does it take sunlight to reach earth" and she can't find an answer. I can query Google's assistant (OK Google) with the same question and I get the correct response. Even Microsoft's Cortana can give me the correct answer.
