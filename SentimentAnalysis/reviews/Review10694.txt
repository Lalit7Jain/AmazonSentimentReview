Ok after downloading the Alexa App and setting up the Echo.....I don't know how I lived without Alexa!!  I mainly use it for Music and News.  works great and gets better all the time.  Save $$ and just get the Echo Dot if music/Sound is not important for you.  Basically the Echo is an Echo dot on top of a Speaker.  A good speaker at that.
