Ok so how much do I love Alexa??? Well... hmmm, I cant fit all of my review w/o boring you! Lets just say my whole family loves it. It makes playing music, getting news, weather and so many other skills you can add to your Alexa so fun !!! Worth every penny I would say. I have Amazon Prime so my music is auto loaded on here too.
