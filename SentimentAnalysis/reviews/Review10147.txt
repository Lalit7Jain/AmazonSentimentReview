I wish I hadn't purchased this. The only thing Alexa seems to do for us is tell a joke or the weather. Half the time she doesn't understand what we're asking or refers us to the app. I added things on the app and she still doesn't recognize what I'm asking. I don't know what people use this for other than smart home devices which we don't currently have.
