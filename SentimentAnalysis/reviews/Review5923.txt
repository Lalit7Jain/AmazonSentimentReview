This is a must have for anyone who loves electronics.  With Amazon Music it is even better.  We even added our IHeartRadio app to it as well.  We went to best buy and bought a Google Home and returned it because it was nothing compared to this.  The sound quality is crisp and adding extra Bluetooth speakers to it was easy.  I also like the app for this as well to see which song is playing.  I hope that soon they will allow search features n the app.
