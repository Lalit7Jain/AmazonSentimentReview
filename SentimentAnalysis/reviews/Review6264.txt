So far we are really liking having Alexa as part of our home.  She is helpful, knowledgeable and has a sense of humor.  I have connected several "smart" home items to Alexa and for the most part they work.  I have several Lutron Caseta wireless dimmer switches and Alexa controls them all easily.  I also connected to nest thermostats and she is able to quickly adjust room temperatures via our voice commands.  I am struggling a bit with my harmony remote link.  I can tell Alexa to turn on or off the television and she does this well, but I can't seem to get here to change channels or adjust the volume.  I suspect to may be the way I have things set up with my harmony ultimate remote.
