While the device works, finding out how to do things with it is far too difficult.  I don't understnd how Amazon can sell such a product and not have a user manual for it that one can simply download and read in pdf format.  Instead, Amazon tries to sell you books/Kindle products that describe how to use the Echo/Alexa system.  A useful instruction manual is something that should be an integral part of any product sold, especially for something that is claimed to be so versatile.  There is a claim that the product can be set up using a web application, but that never worked for me; the application just went to a spinning signal and never connected to the device.  I finally was able to connect but only by downloading an app to my mobile phone. The Amazon online help for the Alexa is poor too.  One does far better using 3rd party help. An example is trying to find out how to set multiple alarm with Alexa.  The Amazon provides no information on that, only telling one how to set an individual alarm.  The Alexa app provides no help either, there being no obvious place to add a 2nd , let alone, a 3rd alarm.
