I love the functionality and the increasing applications.  However, I was disappointed in that I could not connect my echo to my sound system or even my Bose system and that it has to be plugged into an outlet all the time.  Could have bought the DOT for a lot less and combined it with any of my speakers.  My bad as I did not understand.  All in all, I like the product.
