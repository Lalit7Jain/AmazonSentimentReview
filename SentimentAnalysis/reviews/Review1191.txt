I adore this Echo along with my Tap.  Each of them allow me calm my little one with soothing music whether I am in the living room and we want to jam with the speaker boosted Echo or if I want the lower volume Tap.  I also adore the ability to create my shopping list vocally without having to search the house for pen and paper.
