I don't like the app for lists. It constantly annoys me on my phone and drains my battery. Alexa some times does odd things. Like add "find my sharpies" to my list, turned out to put Sharpies on my shopping list. "Buy toilet paper", for some reason was added to my to do list and not my shopping list.
