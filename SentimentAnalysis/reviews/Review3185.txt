Love it! Wish it was as smart as Google Home as far as asking questions about things. She will do that with the right apps but Alexa does more for me than Google would overall. Love the speakers. She reads my Kindle books to me when I'm ironing and working in the laundry room. Love my weather and news briefings. Love that she can give me a what's up on my google calendar. She plays my Pandora for free. And will play music on a whim when asked. She'll order something for me which allows a code to be set up that you give so a child or guest won't leave you with a surprise order! lol She responds to Good Morning with an interesting response. She is a good friend now! You can set up IFTTT app to integrate other apps and deeds for her! And...it was easy other than the google calendar thing. She only seems to recognize google entered apps and nothing layered in from other calendars, like outlook. So I've not been able to integrate work but I have my phone for that so that's ok. I've not turned our home into a smart house yet but she could turn on and off anything electrical with a purchase of a device that talks to internet. Love it!!! Now I want the DOT for the back part of the house! lol
