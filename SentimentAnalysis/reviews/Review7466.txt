It is a cool product.  I bought this one thinking it would have really good sound.  The highs and mid ranges are good but the bass is seriously lacking.  I have an echo dot and its connected to a bose Bluetooth speaker and that sounds awesome.  My suggestion is get an echo dot and a Bluetooth speaker or connect to your stereo.  IMO not worth the price if you listen to music like I do.
