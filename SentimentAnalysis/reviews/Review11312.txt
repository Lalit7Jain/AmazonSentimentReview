The device has great sound - no problems there, and speech recognition works.  Here's my issue:  ALEXA is wholeheartedly a Liberal Democrat that chooses only the ani-Republican news to report, maybe that's a product of CNN's pro-Hillary election lean.  I've gotten tired of all the one-sided election news that I've just unplugged her until the election is over.  ALEXA is not as useful as I thought it would be in daily life, shopping lists is about all we use her for anymore.  Unless things change with the liberal bias of ALEXA we will be selling her at a yard sale soon.
