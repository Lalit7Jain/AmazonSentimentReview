Works as advertised! I've found I use it most for keeping a shopping list, asking for the weather/news update, and playing music. It definitely has a ways to go, in its ability to find answers, as some of the most basic questions it has trouble answering. Nevertheless, I bought an Echo Dot to use in my home as well, since it does come in handy more often than not.
