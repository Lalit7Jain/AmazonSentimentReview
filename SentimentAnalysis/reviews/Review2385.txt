My wife and I have fun with "Alexa", (the wake-up word for Echo) asking her questions such as "how much does a cloud weigh"?  (1,100,000 pounds or 499,000 kilograms for Canadian clouds ;-) or maybe a occasional joke.  She can keep track of your shopping list simply by asking her to add ..... well ..... whatever.  My favorite thing is music. You can ask her to play a single song or a combination of songs from a single artist. BTW, the selections are huge if you are a "Prime" member.
