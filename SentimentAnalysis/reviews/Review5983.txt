"Sorry, I cant find the answer to the question I heard."  im getting REAL sick and tired of hearing that response to questions that this device SHOULD know and be able to find.  From what I hear, google home, can find and answer more things because its tapped into the google web browser itself but you know what?, ECHO should be able to do the same darn thing even it it ISNT tapped into google specifically.  I mean it DOES have access to the internet in a pretty much equal capacity right? It should be able to bring up and tell you about anything thats available on the internet, PERIOD.  AMAZON FIX THIS!  Other than that, I am still giving it 3 stars because I love everything else its able to do. Again though Amazon, that stuff thats not working as it should at the moment, really shouldnt be that hard to get working. Its simple stuff. Dont make me have to through my echo and three echo dots in the trash and go get Google Home. I went with you because I thought you'd be ahead of the game being that you came out with this stuff TWO YEARS before google and anyone else did.
