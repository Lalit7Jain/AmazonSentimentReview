I bought the echo and with basic things it works great, but as you add skills if you don't specifically as the skill to do something in the correct terminology it will not work. It might not sound crucial, but when you have several skills you have to remember the specific way of asking something it's truly not the way you want something to work. Unlike Siri, and the demonstration with Googles Personal assistant you just ask a question and it does it. In conclusion it works well with very basic commands but very disappointed when I ask her to do something related to a skill which is 80% of what she does.
