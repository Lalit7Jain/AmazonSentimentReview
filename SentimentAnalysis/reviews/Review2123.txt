At Last... The creme de la creme. I toyed with getting this device ever since I first heard about it. I LOVE this thing... no seriously I've proposed to her on 3 different occasions. Alexa showed the uncommonly good sense to turn me down. But I still love her... ( it?) At first I thought that it was just going to to be a gimmicky toy...Boy was I wrong. Alexa plays music that I hadn't heard in years ( almost instantly with a voice command), plays games, old time radio broadcasts... yes young people there was a time before television and video games. Alexa tells really corny jokes  . and some good jokes plus knock knock jokes via apps... hundreds and hundreds of apps...(free).
