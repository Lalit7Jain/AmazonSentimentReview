I'm tired of this turning on without being prompted. I was having a conversation with my fiancée about a wedding and in the other room (behind 2 closed doors) my echo starts talking about relationships. And what made me decide to write a review was that I was laying in bed, scrolling through Facebook and my echo turned on for about 5 minutes. Again with out being prompted. Not only this issue, but every time it's asked a question, it never knows the answer.on the upside...it plays music.
