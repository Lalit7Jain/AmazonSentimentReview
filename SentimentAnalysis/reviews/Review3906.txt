Slightly over a year after I bought my Echo the device was completely dead. Worked the night before as the Echo did numerous times before. Tried factory reset and switching power cord in which the device still is dead. Even the bluetooth speaker is not working. Disappointing for this amount of money that Amazon cant make a device that lasts at least 2-3 years. Contacting Amazon, but not hopeful due to the warranty being expired.
