I couldn't make up my mind between Amazon and Google. Decided on Amazon cause i already have a prime account. Can't say how much i LOVE this thing. I hadn't purchased one because i was waiting for apple, but that is just too long - should have purchased the Echo last year. So far so good - have had it for two days and can't believe how it's changed things for the better already. I highly recommend this product.
