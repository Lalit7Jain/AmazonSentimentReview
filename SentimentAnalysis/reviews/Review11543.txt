Then, we wondered if my mom could have the Echo read to her books available through Audible.com.  We have amassed a considerable library of audible books over the years and learned that by registering my mother's Echo to my Audible account, she could listen to all those books using simple voice commands.  It was really simple and has worked out great.  Many of my parents' 80+ year old friends are astounded by the Echo's capabilities which for techno-savvy younger people may seem mundane.  All of which is to say, as the people you love grow older and have trouble typing, seeing or just moving around, consider buying them an Echo.
