It's integration is good, I was able to set it up with IFTTT and control my Harmony remote, it works pretty well with Hue lights.  So it has no problem turning my entertainment system on or off, turning lights on an off, dimming them etc.  It plays Amazon music well, setup is pretty easy, and it does an amazing job of hearing your voice even with background noise, something my Dot does not do nearly as well.
