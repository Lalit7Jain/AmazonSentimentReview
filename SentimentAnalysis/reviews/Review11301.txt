Update 12/1  Still a fan EXCEPT if you order from Alexa besides making sure your one click order settings are what you want, I discovered that the prices that she gives you on "Alexa what are your deals" are not accurate.  I got bit, twice.  If you have any kind of credit, Alexa gives you the price without telling you that she has applied a credit.  For instance the dishwasher tablets that I ordered were not the $4.69 price, they were actually closer to $11 making costco cheaper.  Had she told me that the cost was $11 but that I had a $6 credit that could be applied making the FINAL COST $5 I might have made a different decision.  This is a major flaw for me because I want to know the cost before any of MY credits. This is particularly important when Amazon has told you that you have a $10 gift card coming in a week, and you order a couple of days later never having been told that your "gift card" has already been posted invisibly to your account.  Bottom line, don't tell me that the cost is $0, tell me what you are charging everyone else and then let me know if I can use any of my personal credits.  I suppose I could have deciphered all of that by getting on my computer but then again Alexa has been touted as a convenient easy way of ordering and if within 30 minutes of ordering I have to see that the price she said is the price they charged then what is the point.
