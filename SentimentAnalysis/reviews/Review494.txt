I really enjoyed my Echo when I first received it.  It's all that they say it is and more!  However, after my return window closed, I suddenly lost connection to the internet and no matter what I did to troubleshoot, I could no longer get a connection.  I now have a dead Alexa that will not function.  I'm going to try to connect it at another location as that was one of the tips I read.  I tried the reset button and multiple restarts to no avail.  I checked online for any other possible resolutions and have found that there are many others with the same situation.
