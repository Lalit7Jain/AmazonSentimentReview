I love Alexa she is super.  So far she is integrating with other Smart Home products I am purchasing on Amazon with out issues.  The sound she produced when playing music is great, and I am very surprised by the quality.  My in-laws were having all sorts of fun turning lights off & on with commands and requesting music they seem to like too. I would definitely recommend.
