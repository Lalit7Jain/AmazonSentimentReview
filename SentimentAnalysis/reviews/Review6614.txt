EDIT UPDATE - ALEXA NEEDS PASSWORD PROTECTION:  This is an update 15  days after installing our Echo and Dot... Alexa definitely needs some sort of password protection to keep visitors from using it at their whim.  My son's friends came to the house and annoyingly were giving commands to play loud music in my kitchen while I was watching TV.  I finally had to teach them some manners and tell them to stop.  A password for use of Alexa is very necessary to keep unmannered guests from abusing the privilege of using your personal home device!  This is definitely the first great offering of "home robotics" for the masses.  So cool to control my surroundings, listen to music, get weather, play games and change thermostat all with my voice.  Alexa is not only a conversation piece with party games and tricks, but it's what every household will be using as our step into the future of the robotics age. We have already connected a couple of rooms with the Phillips Hue light kits and with the Nest Thermostat.  The setup is very easy and quick.  If you run into any snags upon setup, there are many places online to get your questions answered.  I purchased the Echo and the Dot and waiting for another Echo when it becomes available.  I recommend placing the Dot in a small bedroom or home office and the Echo in a larger kitchen/Den area because it has a large speaker which does well in places where there are other noises from TV, washers/dryers, fridge motors, etc.  I will probably get the Fire TV with Alexa capability to pair with my Echo.  It works with voice control and the speaker can be used to boost TV sound when using Fire TV.  All in all, this is a great purchase with lots of potential as more and more software skills and smart home skills are added to it.  Would definitely recommend.
