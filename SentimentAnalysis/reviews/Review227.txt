Everything I hoped for in a digital companion and so much more!  She keeps the lights on and turns them off when needed, reminds me of important events, sets alarms and timers, barks like a guard dog, makes pretty bird sounds, orders 400lbs of butter, tells me to sleep well when I tell her goodnight.
