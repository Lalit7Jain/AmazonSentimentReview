Bouht 2 Echos, 4 Dots and a Tap for my home. Work great for about a month. I have these hooked to my security system and home automation so I can tell them to change the temperature in my home or turn on lights, set alarm, lock the doors, shut the garage door. Loved it at first but lately I have encountered problems.  The main issues are slow to respond and dropping wifi connection. I've put alot of money and time into this and like I said, when it works its great, 5 stars but when it doesn't than its about a 2 cause it still does the basics. So I'll give it a 4 for now cause I really want it to work.  Need to update software to alleviate gliches and figure out how to get it to do more than one command at a time.
