I loved this when I first got it and I still like it but it seems like the updates are lagging behind from a real improvement standpoint. Alexa seems to know less not more. I get way too many, "I don't understand the question I heard".  If you're not careful Amazon, Google will leave you in the dust after starting years behind you.
