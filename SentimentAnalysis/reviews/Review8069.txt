I had a big problem and a reason for the 4 star rating.  It is not clear in the instructions that came with the echo and the dot (I purchased both) that you must use a MOBILE device to setup these items.  You can not set them up with the Web based app on a PC.  Even though the directions that come with the device state a URL to go to that will not let you setup devices from a PC.  Wasted time figuring this out.  With respect to the devices  I give 5 stars for quality and construction. Also it makes Siri look really stupid and I'm an Apple guy.
