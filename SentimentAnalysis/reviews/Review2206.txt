Overall, I like Alexa.  She isn't what I'd consider a necessity, but for me, she is a convenient novelty.  Hopefully she will get smarter and more useful as time goes by.  If she does, I'll probably get an Echo Dot to connect with it so that I can make use of some features in some other areas of my home.
