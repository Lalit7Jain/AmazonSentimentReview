My husband and I have years of trying to conceive naturally. We've tried drugs, alcohol, pregnancy test, after pregnancy test.  I've endured humiliation, ridicule, teasing, and being told countless times "YOU CANT HAVE A BABY" or " YOU'LL NEVER HAVE A BABY" and "YOU CANT GET PREGNANT" the one that I hear constantly is "YOURE A GUY, IT WONT HAPPEN". We still try though!
