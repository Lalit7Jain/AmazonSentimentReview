Just picked this up over the weekend with a few Philips Hue bulbs and starter kit.  It was pretty easy to set up (connected to my 5G wifi) and get everything up and running.  I also have a Logitech Harmony Elite universal remote which is connected as well.  I created rooms with the hue app and then groups under the Alexa app, so now when I walk into my apartment all I have to say is "Alexa, turn home on" and it will turn on my living room lights as well as my TV.  It is very responsive and can hear me from pretty much any room; apartment is just under 1,000ft (if you live in a bigger residence then you may need to get some additional echos).  It has had a problem understanding me a few times, you just have to make sure you are speaking clearly as I kind of mumbled the command.  So far I have been very happy with the purchase, now I'm going to look into IFTTT.com and see what else I can do with the Amazon Echo to turn my place into more of a smart home.  I'd get the Nest thermostat and front door locks but not worth it since I'm in an apartment and I don't think they'd like me messing with the wiring and changing the locks.  I would recommend this product.
