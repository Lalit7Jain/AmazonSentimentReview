I am absolutely in love with Alexa and my Echo! As a parent of two kiddos with special needs, Alexa has my back. From alarms to remind me of medications to playing my favorite song, Alexa is there for me. I did a side by side comparison between the echo and google home, and hands down echo outperforms.
