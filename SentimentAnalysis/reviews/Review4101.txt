I’m going to sound negative but I am not negative on the Echo (I have the Echo and just ordered a Dot plus a speaker).  In this review I am going to try to set expectations for any new user.  There are two reasons I wanted a voice operated device: play music and eventually control electrical devices (smart home).  I looked at Google Home and Echo and settled on the Echo because I am an Amazon Prime member and I did not want to pay for another music service like I would have using Google Home. Regarding the second use, we are the early stage of the VHS vs. Betamax like war with these voice controlled devices.  What you need to understand is that most smart hardware control has to be through a “hub” that is part of the controlled device product line or a semi (because there is no universal) universal hub like the Samsung SmartHub or Wink Hub (or other hubs) which talk to some/many but not all smart devices. Echo given its head start appears to be in the lead in the hardware compatibility for now.  The right solution is to build the hub capability into Echo and cut out the middle man hub.  That will take some time just like the Betamax/VHS wars did and the price point of the Echo will go up.
