I think it is a great concept, however it does have room for improvement. I only use this device to add things to my shopping list or to do list. I also will check my DailyHoroscope and do a seven minute workout. I find it difficult to open up certain applications even though I have  asked Alexa multiple times and have followed her directions.  I think once a skill it has been enabled you should just be able to ask her the questions, but that is currently not the case. As of now, you still have to open up the applications as you want to use them. Sometimes this can be time-consuming to open up each one,  or you forget all together what skills you have enabled. I hope that this is fixed soon. Alexa could be utilized much more.
