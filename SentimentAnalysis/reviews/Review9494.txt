Bought this just for fun, but now cannot imagine living without it.  It is unbelievable the things we use it for - weather reports, trivia questions, reordering items from Amazon.  We love having it in the kitchen so we can use it as a timer, but the best so far is being able to add items to a shopping list by just telling Alexa what we need.  If it only did that alone it would be worth the cost.  I know that, as time goes on, we will think of more and more things that Echo can do to make our lives easier
