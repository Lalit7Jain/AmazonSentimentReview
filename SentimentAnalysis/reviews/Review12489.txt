I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  I am not writing for any company.....I'm writing to let the people out there know this is the coolest thing since sweetened cereal.  Oh my gosh!  I love being able to turn it off and on without touching anything, my hands are usually dirty from working in yard or house.  I only wish it could be charged and used without electricity.  That's my only, and very only complaint.  Guess I'll have to figure out away to bring electricity to the beach and lake where my car can't get.  I'm excited about any new developments they will bring to the product and can't wait to see what else she can do.....by the way, I spilled an ashtray and asked her to clean it up...she said she doesn't do that....LOL  Cracked me up!
