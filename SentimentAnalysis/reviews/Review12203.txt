I bought this for my elderly mother and unfortunately she is a little to tech phobic to want to use this. I'm going to keep trying because it is the easiest way for her to play music. She is still living independantly and just would like for her to play some of her favorite music at will - it just takes time to get used to new things. So, I've commandeered it for now to learn how I can simplify it for her and I actually love it so much that I may have to order another one!
