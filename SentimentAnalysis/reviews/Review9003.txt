The Echo with Alexa has made listening to my Kindle Unlimited books with audio and my audiobooks from Audible a pleasure! Before Alexa the best way to listen to Kindle Unlimited books with audio was through the Audible App (downloading books on the Audible App creates a much smaller file than downloading to the Kindle App and the Audible App has more features like a sleep timer and smooth narration at 1.25 x speed). Alexa improves on the Audible App by letting you activate the sleep timer without lifting your head from the pillow.
