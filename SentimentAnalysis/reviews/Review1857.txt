It's not bad but it does have limitations, you cannot ask follow-up questions with any expectations of Alexa answering correctly. Example: Who are the cast members of Capricorn one? Alexa got right but ask a follow-up question "When was it released?" it has no idea what you're asking. In a few years these types of assistance will be great, in 10 years... Those of us who have survived we'll be workers/pets to the machine.
