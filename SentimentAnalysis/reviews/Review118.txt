Echo was a Christmas gift. Set it up in a temporary apartment January to April, 2017, no problem. It was cute, but definitely a toy for ordering on Amazon. Rarely could answer a question that wasn't just "whats the weather today?" or command "play a radio station" or "play Amazon music" which was novel but not necessary. When I brought it to new apartment it would not connect to internet. I called internet provider, made sure I knew correct password, reset Alexa after unplugging and plugging it in, used the Alexa App to set it up for the past two hours...nothing. It just stalls out in "preparing your Echo" then error message 7.3.00.1. All other devices connecting to internet without a problem. Very disappointing given expense of gift. Would not recommend.
