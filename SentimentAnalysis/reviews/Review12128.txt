Got one for me and one for my elderly mother - we both love it.  I like to use it for listening to audio books and music as well as getting news and weather.  The "skills" (not "apps) are free thus far and while I haven't found one that I can't live without, they seem to be coming out with new ones all the time so I'm hopeful for their betterment in the future.
