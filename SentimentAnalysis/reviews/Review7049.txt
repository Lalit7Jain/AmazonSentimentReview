Works well, though you must script what you say to control lights and thermostats. Works well when telling it to turn on music, asking for weather and traffic. Her voice is robotic and annoying at times. She also has a difficult time when saying certain music artists names an confuses them frequently (Kaleo vs Coolio). There are many skills and it works with IFTTT though they are clunky. Skills are turned on by specific words "thermostat", I most of the time want to say "temperature", which then requires me to correct myself, or script what I say. Would be much happier if I could change some of the activate words to work with the Skills I use. Overall, I enjoy it and recommend it. Look forward to improvements and more Skills.
