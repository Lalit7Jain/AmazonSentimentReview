Oh my goodness!  Alexa is my new best friend.  Great sound and I love all the other features, shopping list, to do list etc.  At age 76 my memory for the little things could use an overhaul.  It's great when I am cooking and see that I am running low on something to speak to Alexa and have her add to my shopping list.  Never thought I would be so fond of an electronic, but I am.  Now if I could just program her to do floors and clean the toilets I would be over the moon.
