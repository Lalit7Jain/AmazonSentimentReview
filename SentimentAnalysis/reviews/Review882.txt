Additionally, during the time I've had the three products, I can't say the capabilities have expanded all that much.  Alexa has become more compatible with different hardware, but verbal interactions continue to be basic and pretty crude; as an example, you can't ask Alexa two questions in a row re: the same thought, as the Echo can't hold the information to connect the two questions together and will state it doesn't understand you.  It would also be really useful if Amazon could create more trigger words to awaken the Echo, as "Alexa," "Echo," and "Amazon" start to become very monotonous, as well as the continual "Okay" when it completes a task (for about a week last year it suddenly responded with a tone instead, which sounded a lot more sophisticated, but then it abruptly switched back to "Okay.").  At times it reacts and sounds much like a kid's toy.
