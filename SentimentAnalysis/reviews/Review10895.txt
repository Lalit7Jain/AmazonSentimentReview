Works great, but need to keep expectations in line. Some more complex operations takes a little work to understand how to work. Such as using the other applications it supports. They can be a little troublesome because you  have to remember how to activate them, which is not as simple as using Alexa's builtin features. I always seem to forget each app's special "word" that activates them.
