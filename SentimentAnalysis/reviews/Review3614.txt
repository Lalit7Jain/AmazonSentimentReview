An interesting audio playback device with some ginger bread tossed on top that can do some basic work like updating calendars, but before you buy one you should know that this isn't the computer on the Starship Enterprise.  It has no idea what the barometric pressure at the nearest NWS office is, it can't tell you traffic conditions until you manually type an address into the phone app, and even occasionally has issues finding music in your Prime Music account.  The sound coming from it is crystal clear and it will do a few cute things like finish movie lines for you but this has a long way to go to be truly useful.  Hopefully the folks behind the cloud will eventually allow the product to grow in utility.  Right now I am not sure its worth the price.
