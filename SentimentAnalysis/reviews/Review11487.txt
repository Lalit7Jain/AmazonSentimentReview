We put the Echo in our bedroom and let Alexa play music to fall asleep to every night with a sleep timer. Waking up, we get the day's weather, can check the time without needing contacts, turn on and off the lights, and even check in on sports scores. I have yet to see any issue with our refurbed Echo, and I've been very impressed with the voice recognition and ease of use. We're getting some Dots to use around the house in other areas because we've enjoyed Alexa so much.
