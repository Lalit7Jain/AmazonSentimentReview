I purchased an Echo about 6 months ago. As with any tech purchase I was very excited to receive my new echo but the excitement was short lived. I have a speech impairment so I expected with any voice recognition software to have to learn my speech pattern; I thought there would be a paragraph that a person has to read 3 or 4 times for the software to learn your speech pattern, but there wasn’t. There isn’t any set-up for the voice recognition software so it just arbitrarily dismissed me.
