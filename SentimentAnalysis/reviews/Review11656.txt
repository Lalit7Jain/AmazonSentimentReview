I don't know if it's because I have a reconditioned Alexa or what, but this product is not living up to the hype. I can ask Alexa to play my book it has to be a book that I just opened up in Audible. Asking for the book by name wont work. Alexa almost always plays the last book that I read. If I ask it to play it again, sometimes Alexa plays the book before that one. Alexa listens to the TV commercials that mention it's name and seems somewhat perplexed. I can ask to listen to, say, BBC Newshour once and have that work fine and only later have Alexa tell me that it can't find the channel.  I had a devil of a time trying to get Alexa to play a playlist that i had on Amazon. I finally had to name it to something really simple in order for it to be found. Sometimes it interrupts a stream to tell me that it can't play it, and then continues to play it. I find myself using the App and bluetooth a lot and turning off the voice recognition. I live in a small space so having a small speaker is awesome. As far as I can tell, the software just isn't there yet.
