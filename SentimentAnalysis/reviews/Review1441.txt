Okay, we've had the echo for several days now so I can give an initial review only. My personal opinion is that this is an over priced product for its current model and capabilities. The sound is of good quality and balance treble and bass, has ability to fill room with sound similar to Bose accustcs but not even close in clarity, but definitely adequate for most people. There are several issues I've noticed from the get go. Once volume is above 4 Alexa can't hear voice commands. So a remote is definitely needed. ( Should be included at this price point) The most important issue is that Amazon uses Bing, not Google as its search engine, that's not likely ever to change. Amazon is in direct competition with Google for this market. From reading reviews it seems Amazon has rushed production of its devices in its ecosystem too often before they are ready for release. I'm certain many issues with this Echo will be addressed with firmware updates. If you really can't easily afford this device even using flex pay, my recommendation is to pass on this product and purchase an Echo DOT instead. The Dot actually can hear commands at any volume level and the sound is acceptable for music. Again if buying this product stretches your budget even a little, my advice is to pass on it. Wait for the inevitable second or third generation and just purchase a Dot. The Dot is clearly the MUCH better buy as it can do everything the Echo can do, without the artificial surround sound.
