Alexa is my new best friend!  I LOVE the shopping list feature.  We just tell Alexa what to add and then we have the list on our phones everywhere we go. We were able to attache multiple profiles for Pandora as well which is great since my house differs in music taste.  I am looking forward to adding some SmartHome switches and devices to try as well.  Alexa responds great regardless of the noise in the room too which makes her very easy to use.
