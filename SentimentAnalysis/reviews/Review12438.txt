Alexa is one of the best purchases that I have made on Amazon. We use her for background music when we have company. We use her inside or bring her out on the patio with us. She is a great fact checker too. My kids love to ask her questions and hear what she has to say. You can sync her up to your google music or spotify accounts. We also purchased the voice remote as well, so we don't have to scream commands across the room.
