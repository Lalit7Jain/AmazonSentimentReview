My son bought this for me because I enjoyed it at his house.  I love to call up a song and work in the kitchen and love the list features as well - and ordering.  NOW it's going to be 3.99 a month for music?  I also bought 3 kindle fires for Christmas and especially for the older grandson to get music through his dad's prime.  Now, apparently that is going to be 8.99 a month for him as well (for music).  FALSE ADVERTISING Amazon - I've passed on the benefits of Amazon Prime and Kindle and now Kindle Fire to my family and friends for a while - not happy with these changes at all.  We pay for prime!
