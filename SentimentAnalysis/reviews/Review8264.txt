Certainly wish I had bought this sooner!  It's very fun to play with!  Setup was a breeze, and the built in speaker can get LOUD!  I have now bought the Phillips HUE light bulbs and bridge as I transform my home into a smart home.  Very cool when the Echo can turn lights on and off in different rooms!
