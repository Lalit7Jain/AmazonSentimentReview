I hope the big wigs are looking at this. I really love the music and some of the games. BUT why can't y'all get the answers like google home!  It's not hard to get that software. I ask simple questions and Alexa always says don't understand the question.  I can say it 5 different ways and still Alexa can't answer it but I can ask the same questions on the google home and it works fine!  Also directions. Alexa can't do that either.  Please amazon look into changing those softwares because I know I am not the only person complaining about it.
