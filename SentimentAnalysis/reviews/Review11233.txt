I love this product, but it fails at what I really wanted to do with it--create a house-wide entertainment system.  I wish I could sync it with other Bluetooth speakers around the house so I could have a song playing in multiple rooms around the house (and outdoors).  I'm looking forward to all the additional skills that are constantly being added, although mostly it's just used for music and simple question tasks.
