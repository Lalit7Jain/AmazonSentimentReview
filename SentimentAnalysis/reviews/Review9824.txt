Sound is great and responds to commands well. Wanted to pair with bluetooth speakers to use on our deck, but the full size model will not pair, only the Dot.  That sucks, now have to make a trip to Kohl's to return the Jam Classic I bought. Guess I'll just take the Dot we own outside in the summer.
