WISH you could sync music between several and WISH it didn't need to be plugged in to work.  WISH there was some battery life so that when it's moved from one room outlet to another room outlet that it would retain its memory.  Maybe in the next version?  Other than that, have been using everyday since it arrived for music and alarms, news, radio, weather, like it a lot!
