I think the main reason I never use Siri is that I have a smartphone that can tell me everything she could and more. I also don't want to draw attention to myself in public in that way. Why would I talk to a disembodied voice on my phone and have strangers stare at me when I can just as easily tap it out quietly on the screen? Unless you're on the phone with someone, there just aren't that many things that require you to talk to your phone. And chances are you've probably mastered typing on your smartphone to the point where busting out a question in Google takes seconds.
