Don't waste your money on this, just buy a good Bluetooth speaker.  I have had my Echo for about three months.  It can only answer questions if you enable the appropriate skills to do so, then you have to remember the command for each skill in order for it to respond.  Although it is not a bad speaker, it has a very low success rate of opening and playing music when I ask it too.  It also has a tendency of just stopping in the middle of a song and I can't get it to work again without unplugging it and plugging back in.
