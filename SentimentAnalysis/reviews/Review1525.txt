Pros: Too many to list - My wife and I use it primarily for listening to music/radio, asking the time, weather, alarms (which is awesome when cooking) and creating shopping lists. It does those things almost perfectly. I also took a Dot with me to Australia and it was great having a little bit of home with my on the road.
