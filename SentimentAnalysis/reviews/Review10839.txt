Overall I like the device and find it useful. Suggested Enhancements are to allow for multiple shopping lists with user definable head topics...eg... My home depot shopping list is vastly different than my grocery list. Only supporting one list limits my ability. I also suggest that there be integration into iTunes so I can play from my shared desktop library via Wifi..so Bonjour access...same with Windows media player.
