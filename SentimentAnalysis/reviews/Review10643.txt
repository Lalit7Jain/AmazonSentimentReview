Nice toy, was easy to pair Bluetooth.  Sadly it is not very intuitive.  Simple questions, easily answered by asking Google render Alexa  perplexed.  Adding liked songs to Amazon Music requires you to open the Alexa App. What's the point of a voice recognition device that requires you to use another device to do so?  Google can do it, so please don't go the way of the Nook..
