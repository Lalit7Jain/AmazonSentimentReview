I love this lady!!!  At first I mostly used my Echo for music.  That's why I went with the Echo over the Dot.  Better sound quality overall.  Now that I've had the Echo a few months I've learned of many other tasks that make my life as easy as just asking.  I know I've only barely broken the surface of the Echo's abilities, but I'm having a blast as I go along.  My home is open concept and I have my Echo placed in a central location.  It understands my voice commands easily from out of the box.  You want to download the App to your phone.  That gives you more control and allows you to add "Skills" to your Echo.  I got it because I wanted it, not needed it.  I still don't think I need it, but I'm having fun with it and does come in very handy.  Especially if all you want to do is listen to music.  Just ask Alexa to play whatever, band, song or genre.
