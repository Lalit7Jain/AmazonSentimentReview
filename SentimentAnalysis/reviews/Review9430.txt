The sound quality when playing music is excellent, especially when compared to the Google Home - which I did side-by-side. The microphone also has good range; it can hear a command from another room or floor of my house. My only complaint is that the set up was a little more difficult than expected (I had to contact customer service as the included directions were not clear) and it cannot answer questions like Google Home can. Once the number of available apps increases and the device has access to a good search engine, I will rate it a 5-star. I would also like to see Amazon include a 1 year membership in Amazon Music with the device, rather than a 30 day membership. The cost to Amazon would be minimal but the advantage over the Google Home would be tremendous.
