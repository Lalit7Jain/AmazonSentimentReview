If you like to listen to music Alexa is a must have product.  I just bought it out of curiosity but I use it often for the weather and to play music.  You can tell her to play country music and she will play top country station or whatever type of music you want.  She will also play specific songs.  We have 2 parakeets that like to hear the Green Acres theme song.  Where else can you get that just by asking?  Nowhere!  It will also do many other things and Amazon is constantly adding to what the Echo can do with updates.  My Mom who is in her late 60's and will not even get a smart phone thought Alexa was Amazing!  So I may get her one for Christmas.  You must have WIFI in your house but I imagine most people these days do.
