My best purchase ever. I have it setup with my Harmony Hub. I control my entire entertainment system with it. I also have it setup with VeraPlus. I can control my entire house. Turn on/off lights, turn off appliances and control both upstairs and downstairs thermostats. It is so awesome that I purchased a Dot2 for another room and I think I will purchase another Echo for upstairs. I use Alexa for my weather, commute, news and listen to Spotify. Alexa play Aerosmith, "Playing Aerosmith from Spotify...... LOVE IT,
