ECHO VS THE DOT: I am adding this because I myself asked this question.  If you have a bluetooth speaker system in your home already then go ahead and go with the Dot.  If you do not then go with the regular sized Echo.  The speaker quality is pretty awesome in the Echo unit.  I am pleased with this.  It was worth the cost!
