At first his was fun, so I decided to upgrade to prime so we could request specific songs to play. 3 days later and I'm considering canceling prime. There's no way to set parental controls on anything so my 13 yr old thinks it's funny to show her friends that this device will do whatever you ask. She plays songs filled with sex, drugs and explicit language when I'm not in the room. Now that I have prime I can't turn off prime music without canceling my prime membership altogether. Also most of the games / skills don't understand what you are saying so they get frustrating. I do like the timer and grocery list features though.
