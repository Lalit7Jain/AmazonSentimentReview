I've been an avid Amazon customer since they started.  I have 2 kindles and was relatively satisfied.  I read all the rave reviews for the Echo, Echo Dot and Tap.  They seemed legitimate; however, I guess those reviewers either had low expectations or were incentivized to express those favorable opinions.  After going on an Echo Dot, Tap and Echo purchasing frenzy, I now have a total of 3 Dots,1 Tap and 1 Echo and am suffering buyers remorse.
