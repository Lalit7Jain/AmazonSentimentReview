My husband laughs at me when I ask Alexa a question and she responds...he says I get the look of a child who did something wonderful on my face.  Yeah, so what...I like Alexa and she's awesome!  Still adding new skills, but she's been great so far at answer questions, adding to my lists and making life easier...no more googling for this gal when it's a simple question I can ask Alexa.  Funny, I find myself being so polite to her...I almost feel like I should offer her a cup of coffee...so I did.  See what her response is.
