after a ton of research i purchased this for my disabled mother to help with activites, books, music etc.  You are limited to what you can do based on the apps they have, then you have to mention the app, you can't ask a question like you can do Siri on a phone, she doesn't understand, does work very well with audible, we kept asking Alexa to play Christian Hymns, and alexa doesn't understand, you have to build a playlist, you can link your google account to it, and ask Alexa what is on my calendar today, but you can't ask alexa to enter an appointment into the calendar, you can't ask alexa to add a contact or call a person, you have to do the entry web based.  Im really wondering if it would have been better to purchase the Google product......I can only hope Alexa expands its capabilities, especially working seamlessly with google accounts.
