A great techie device to join in the AI craze. I love the freedom to summon up almost any song by voice command. I also enjoy the "flash briefing" customized to my favorite news sources(e.g. Wall Street Journal, NPR, etc.). I would like to see its search engine more like Google's though. Too often Alexa tells me she doesn't understand a question that I believe "Hey, Google" would understand. I have not fully utilized it though for smart home use or other desirable functions I've read about. I hope that it will continue to learn new tricks and improve search capabilities.
