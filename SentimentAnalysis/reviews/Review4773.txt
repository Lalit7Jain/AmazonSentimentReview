Echo has brought music back into our home.  It is so easy to use, and I can request just about any kind of music.  Echo shuffles and plays it.  The speaker is very good, and the sound fills our rather large living room.  We are just starting to connect lights, etc. to Echo, and it is nice to tell it to turn on the lights and heat in our basement before we go down there.  There is so much more this will do. Very happy with this purchase.
