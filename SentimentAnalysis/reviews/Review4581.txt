My major complaint comes from Alexa's selective hearing. I've done several sessions to get it adjusted to my voice but that doesn't explain how it will sometimes add entire words on its own when repeating requests back to me. I've also noticed it's "listening" window varies greatly. Even with no background noise at all and it playing at low to moderate volume (5), it will have a hard time understanding or even register that I'm trying to give it a request.
