Pros: The voice recognition is very good and alexa responds well from across the room to about 30 feet. The volume and sound quality (especially music) is good for the size of the package. Volume gets louder than I expected. Of course, when playing music loud you might have to get closer to the Echo for your voice to be heard, but no deducts for that!
