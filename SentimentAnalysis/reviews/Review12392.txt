Once you get the hang of using the Echo your amazed at how useful it is.  From Amazon music, to timers and questions this thing is great.  Has surprisingly good sound quality.  I would have never bough a Bluetooth speaker if I had gotten this sooner.  Alexa is better than Siri.  She understands you from clear across the room and has pretty good accuracy is understanding what you need.  Even works with my home heating and cooling system.
