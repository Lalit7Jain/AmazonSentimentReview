The Amazon Echo is great! I put it in the general kitchen/family room area and ALEXA follows my instructions well wherever I am standing. The Echo also evolves as new software is developed for it, giving it more capabilities. What's pretty cool is that ALEXA recognizes both my and my husband's voices and will respond to play from our different music collections. Also, the sound quality is really good, which is a pleasant surprise.
