In the early days of living with Alexa so we'll update as things progress.  Fun and fairly accurate, Alexa is pretty good.  MAJOR issue is it's use of Bing as the search engine.  No where NEAR as powerful as Google and you get a lot of "I didn't understand your request" from Alexa.  That needs to be fixed.  Secondly, voice-controlled sound volume of the Echo is not very accurate.  Twisting the top ring is the only way we've found for precise volume control.  All other aspects of the Echo are top notch.
