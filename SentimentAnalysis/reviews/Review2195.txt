If you don't have smart home technology this is basically an over priced speaker for your phone and a large Siri to answer questions.  I purchased a less expensive bluetooth speaker and got better sound quality.  Over priced for what it does.  Needs more skills like Spotify, Pandora, etc.  much too limited in skills.
