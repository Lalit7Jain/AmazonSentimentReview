Great for playing music stored on computer, tablet or phone or from internet app.  Just tell it what you want and it will find it.  Searches the internet for answers to your questions.  Immediate news and weather reports.  Interfaces with other wireless products.  Love it.  It's hard to remember to wake Alexa up before making a request, at least at first.  Great sound quality.  It would be worth the price if you only wanted to us it as a wireless speaker.  But it can do so much more.
