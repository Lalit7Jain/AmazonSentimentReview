Easy to set up and use, can't wait to see what else she will be able to do in the future.  I already have her working with our Nest thermostat, 2 wemo wall plugs and the harmony companion remote with hub.  I have also subscribed to Amazon Music Unlimited and have listened to more music over the last few weeks than I have in ages.  Good Quality speaker, glad I bought this over the dot.  It's strangely comforting to have another 'being' in the house, a bit like having a pet around.
