First off this is a great technology that I have really enjoyed.  Sometimes she cant hear me and I have to say Alexa pretty loud.  There are a lot of questions she doesnt know so you just have to use her for what she is good at and you will appreciate Echo.  I love having her for music and radio for sure.  My wife has really taken her over though and uses her more than I do!
