The echo is pretty cool as we all know. But she has her issues. There are many things I feel I should be able to ask of her that she's just not willing to do (or admit that she knows or can do). I hope with time she'll get better. We also have issues with her hearing us sometimes. I can be standing right next to her and like a typical women, just ignores my advances. I'd like a little more personality and adjustability. And to hell with this music unlimited. I pay for prime. Give me my music!!
