The Alexa App on my Android smartphone has problems. Not only is it excruciatingly slow to load when I first try to bring it up, it often "hangs" displays its little spinner icon until I go to my home screen and use an application manager to kill the app. While the app *usually* works when I re-load it, this problem with the app hanging doesn't just happen when it is first loaded; it often happens in the middle of a shopping trip when I return to the app after the phone has snoozed off, forcing me to again kill-and-reload the app. Hopefully Amazon will work to address this issue in the future.
