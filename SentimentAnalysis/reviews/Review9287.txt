All it needs is a clock display that blinks 12:00 because it isn't any more useful than other devices that do that such as a VCR or coffee maker. Maybe I will use it as a paper weight. I have no other use for it.  I imagine it will go the way of other Amazon products like their telephone. I should have known better than to buy this after they discontinued selling the phone I bought. Somehow I was stupid enough to think it would be able to control another useless POS device called Wink. There are two problems with that 1) Echo can't even do simpler tasks let alone understand how a home automation system should work, and 2) the Wink is just as worthless as the Echo and doesn't even work with devices sold by Wink let alone others I already had. One of these years I will take them both apart and put the electronics to better use in something else.
