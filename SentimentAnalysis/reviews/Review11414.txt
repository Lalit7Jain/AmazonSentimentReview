Cool concept, works as advertised. Bought a battery that mounts to the base to make it portable around the house. Voice recognition isn't very good at high volume, but I suppose that's too be expected. Not much bass, so don't expect this to be the best standalone Bluetooth speaker, but that was never it's intention. Cool tech, just need to remember she's there more.
