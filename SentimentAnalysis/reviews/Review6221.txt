Love love love LOVE my Echo (Alexa)!!!  A friend of mine had gotten this a few months ago and whenever I was at their house I had a ball playing music, asking questions, turning lights on and off!  Didn't realize there was so much more to what she can do.  I manage my shopping and to do lists which is amazing not to have to stop and grab a pen and paper every time something pops into my head, like when I'm sitting on the couch or in the middle of cooking dinner and my hands are all mucked up and I know I need more paper towels!  I just tell Alexa to add to my shopping list and voila. Also, I've connected to Pandora and Spotify which is amazing to just ask her to play a playlist or specific song or album and never have to touch anything to do so.  The quality of the speaker is pretty good too, can easily fill a room on a low setting - you're not going to get subwoofer quality sound but it's still very good quality! I look forward to future enhancements to this product and am very happy about this purchase!
