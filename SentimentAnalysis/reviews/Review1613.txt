I try to ask Alexa to play my music... turn on my lights.. put this on my to do list... she wont even let me speak!!!! It worked all this time and perfectly fine this morning!! I have taken more care of this device than I have anything ever.. now its broken?! Its now broken.. I restarted it.. everything.. It wont let me say one word without it turning off after she turns on when I say "Alexa". I hope it needs just an update.. if this is the product that came out of Amazon.. Very disappointed.. Please fix this.
