After reading some of the reviews concerning the sound of the Echo's speaker,  I was ready to return it before I even received and tried the device out. I'm glad I have it a chance, don't get me wrong it's not a top of the line audio system but it's more than enough for me to listen to music in the kitchen as I cook. The sound is very clear and all around I have no complaints about it at all. I would definitely recommend the Echo to anyone I know. I'm really happy I gave it a chance. Planning to purchase another for my bedroom, soon.
