My con is unfortunately making me return this unit.  My children love this and have constantly asked Alexa questions.  It's great to see them interact with it.  However, the kids have come home from school asking it to play the WORST things possible on Amazon's Music list.  Kids will be Kids but this is just unbelievable that there's not a way to block some of its Music capabilities.  I've come into the room with Music filled with so many F-Bombs and N-Words that I have my 5 year old running around saying these words.
