Absolutely fantastic. I am a regular user of Siri and Kinect (Xbox One) and Alexa blows the two out of the water; most noticeably with the ability to hear and understand me. I am a heavy user of Spotify and made it my default music service but it still allows me to tap into amazon music by saying "Using amazon music find X". I am looking forward to getting some smart lights as well. After a few days of using echo I have high hopes.
