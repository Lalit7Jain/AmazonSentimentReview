My better half works from home and uses Alexa to help with date calculations, reminders, timers and to play music. Alexa can order rides from Lyft, office supplies, and snacks. My favorite part is no more quick stops at the store on the way home! Alexa orders from PrimeNow and can have missing ingredients, cat food or the occassional phone charger delivered before I even get home.
