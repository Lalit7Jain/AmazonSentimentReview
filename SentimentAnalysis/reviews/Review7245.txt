Received as a gift for Christmas. So far, I like it. I have the Echo sitting in the middle of my apartment so that I can basically talk to it just about anywhere, although in the distant corners you have to raise your voice a bit. Since I've had it for 3 days now, my main functions have been to play music with it, check weather, or make lists.
