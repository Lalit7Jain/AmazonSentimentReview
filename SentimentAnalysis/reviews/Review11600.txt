I'm obsessed with this. I don't have to use my arms and hands anymore. It's fantastic. I haven't even delved into all the other stuff Alexa will do for me. But the fact that I can eventually have her turn off all my lights and appliances makes me the happiest person in the world. If she could go to work for me I'd marry her.
