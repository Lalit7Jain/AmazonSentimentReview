I thought I would love it but it's completely redundant. It does nothing that my Iphone can't do, and it's not portable like my iphone is.  Also it doesn't understand my commands like Siri does and if you're tv is on it has a hard time understanding your commands.  It's a great idea but it doesn't function well enough to be worth the cost and the space it takes up. I returned it.
