Got this as a Christmas present from my son. Absolutely the coolest thing since sliced bread. Great for info, weather, music. I know an iPhone can do many of these tasks, but just to be able to ask for certain music as background while I'm working around the house is well worth the cost. Plus the speakers are much better than I expected when I first saw the Echo in the box.
