Surprising good sound for medium to large room. Voice response consistently good, had to reboot the Echo a couple of times when it would not respond to commands.  Haven't tried a lot of the functions as yet, mostly basic service Prime music.  Good selection of "stations" and artists, but some quirks--like "best of" artist includes a bunch of Xmas music, many artist's selections do not include all of their hits. (You can pay $8/month for full music service which I assume offers more selections). A lot of artists not really represented on basic service. Listen to 70's rock a lot and there is a lot of repetition if on for several hours (Sirius Radio has better playlist). This is not a service/product for true audiophile but a nice "toy" at a good price for small households, and/or select rooms. Easy set-up, simple, unobtrusive design, functional and fun.
