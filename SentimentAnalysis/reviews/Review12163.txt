Yes, you can talk to it, but you better ask one of a limited number of things, because you'll find it just doesn't understand most things. Very simple commands like 'Play the album _____' just don't work half the time. Instead ask 'Play the album _____ by artist ______'. I shouldn't need to be that specific.
