Amazed at all these 5 star reviews. This thing is so UNIMPRESSIVE. 90 percent of the time it is unable to answer simple questions. You spend more time trying to "reword" things, to make this rather stupid device understand, than I care to admit. The quality of this speaker is a little above a clock radio.  I see what they mean when they say "Amazon rushed this to the market to beat Google Home". It was a rush that created a crummy product. Quite possibly will be returned.
