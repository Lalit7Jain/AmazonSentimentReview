4. The EQ curve being applied to the music is sadly very mid-bass heavy. As a result, the rest of the music spectrum sounds muddy. The high end is quite lacking. I realize there is a limited amount of space inside the enclosure, but artificially boosting one frequency at the cost of all others really alters the clarity of the source material. I would have preferred a significantly more flat equalization curve. Faithful reproduction is far more important than being able to wake your neighbors with artificially boosted bass. At least provide a way to turn off artificial EQ settings. Flat is where it's at.
