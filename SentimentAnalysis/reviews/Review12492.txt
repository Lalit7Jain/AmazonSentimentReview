here are more "skills" that can be added than I have time to learn about.  The shopping list app is ok, but could be so much better.  There is now competition from Google and Samsung and I'm sure these companies will do a great job, but for now, I don't think they can compare.  It would be nice if Amazon could do some integration with my Roku or Comcast to control my TV.
