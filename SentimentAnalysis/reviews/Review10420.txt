Needs to come with pre-defined "links" to news sources, etc.  Out of the box, it should be able to answer "Alexa, what is the stock price of X?"  but it can't -- you first have to set up a connection with a stock quote provider....  tedious for each of your news sources.  Amazon should pick a standard "bundle", like Basic Cable, which gives you a useful environment to work in.  Ditto for setting up and connecting my music from Amazon Prime Music to makes lists that Alexa can play.....
