My main issues with the echo... I hate that it has to be plugged in at all times, with an accessory sold separately to accommodate this function that should be built into any wireless speaker in this day and age, but amazon has a habit of bringing back prehistoric attributes to their products. Perfect example, the firestick being introduced to the public as a means to stream media, while the majority of people already own tablets laptops and cellphones that do all that already, and much more efficiently, and bringing nothing new to the table. There's nothing a firestick can do that the others can't, but there's plenty more they can do that the firestick can't. It's like unveiling dialup internet, in a world of wifi
