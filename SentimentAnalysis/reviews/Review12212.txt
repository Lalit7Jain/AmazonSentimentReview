When my husband first told me about the Echo, I thought it seemed silly, but now I can't imagine my life without Alexa. She helps me find my phone when I've lost it, keep multiple timers going while cooking dinner, entertains me by playing music from Pandora or Amazon Prime, turn on and off my lights so I don't have to struggle with my full hands to find the switch, and gives me the weather update.
