I'm very surprised at the limitation of voice understanding and information retrieval.  When I ask Alexa a question and it doesn't understand I ask the same question on Google on my cell phone and it always knows the answer.  It can be simple things like "what is the phone number to Walgreens near me or what time is the Dallas and Green Bay game tonight".  Each time it is confused but Google comes up with the answer via voice control.  Also, when I ask for a weather forecast I only get today and tonight.
