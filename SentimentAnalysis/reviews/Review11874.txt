1) It does not interface well with iTunes, and cannot interact with your iTunes library in any convenient manner.  The only way you can get to your itunes music library is by pairing your phone.  You can do this with a few voice commands,  "Alexa Connect" will attempt to connect to your phone, it can go forward, backward etc. in your music but control is very limited, you cannot search for something in your library.  For example if I ask it to play something that Amazon offers in it's library and my itunes library, it will disconnect from the phone and play the Amazon version, meaning I have to reconnect the phone to get back to my music.  Not sure whose being stubborn on this one Apple or Amazon but it's not surprising they don't play well together.  Also the volume needs to be increased way up to play any connected bluetooth music source, once you are done then the volume on Alexa is way too high.  So if you use iTunes it's a pain, basically you might as well just control your music from the phone once connected.
