I love my Echo! From news tidbits to shopping lists, this is my go to gadget! Im looking forward to getting more accessories for my home. But for now, Alexa is here to stay. I love that updates are automatic. Nothing like surprise new features! We do jeopardy,  brain and cat facts, and many other applications. My family loves Alexa. She can get a little snappy with you at times, which we think is funny. But, she's a part of our family! Thank you, Anazon!
