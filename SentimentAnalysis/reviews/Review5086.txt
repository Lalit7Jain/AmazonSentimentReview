We've used our Echo for over a year now and I'm finding it pretty useful in the kitchen.  But I find the fact that there's only a female voice option distracting.  Every time she talks, I'm reminded that men associate female voices with servitude.  This is so Fifties.  I look forward to a range of possible voices.  I'd give anything for the voice of HAL.
