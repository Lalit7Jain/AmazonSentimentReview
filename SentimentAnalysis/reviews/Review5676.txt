I regret buying this piece of crap. I can ask it simple questions & it can't even answer them. I asked it if she knew what a flute was?.. she said champagne glasses ok my mistake, so than I asked her do you know what the instrument flute is? she said she didn't know the answer. My intention was to here wooden flute music since it relaxes me she never knew what that meant. so than I asked her to play it by naming the title of the cd she couldn't do that either. ugg you ask her what does the whale sound like she can't do that either ugh . Should of bought the google one!!.you name it & she hears it wrong or can't answer it! Alexia you were a big mistake
