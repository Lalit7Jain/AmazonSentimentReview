I have a Sonos music system throughout the house with multiple speaker setups so I don't use Echo for listening to music.  I have Echo setup with Spotify, but don't use it. I find that it would only be acceptable for a small room such as an office, bedroom or bathroom and maybe a kitchen.  If your into quality sound then look elsewhere for your main music listening environment.  I'm still waiting for the Sonos / Alexa integration.  This should add some usefulness to Echo.
