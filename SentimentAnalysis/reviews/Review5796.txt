Sound quality seems good to my ancient ears and it is more than loud enough. It works fine for turning lights on and off, playing music on Amazon Prime, giving you the time and a host of other things. However it is not an AI. It only functions with a preselected list of questions. If you don't ask a question the proper way, it doesn't understand. Also internet searches other than a wiki search do not seem to work. So in comparison to OK Google it isn't quite as capable on the internet. However OK Google doesn't give me the answer I want more often than not, so it's not quite there yet either. On the other hand I was impressed by how well it recognized my voice and I have not used the voice training provided. My wife has a little more trouble with it however it still works quite well. It has difficulty if you talk too fast or you do not pause for 1/2 a second after using the wake up key word "Alexa". My main complaint is the lack of ability to do a general search for news or information on the web and it's inability to understand plain English commands that are not preprogrammed. Other than that, it's a good product and I recommend it.
