The Echo allows you to play whatever you want to hear such as seasonal music or a specific song you spontaneously think of.  When cooking I use the timer feature and have set up to 2 timers at once (even if in the middle of playing music and will resume after it prompts the time set). Asking for the weather will give you a brief local forecast, you can ask for the news and personalize what stations you hear on the app, and acquire traffic information on your daily commute. You can also play games like Jeopardy and ask for holiday jokes.
