Ok, I purchased 4 Echo units over time and I am shocked that Amazon has not put dual volume setting on it. One that you can set to PLAY music and a second for when the Echo is talking TO you.  We have Alexa play background music at level 3.  Then we ask it a question and can not hear it's reply! When you are showing off AI (of sorts): Alexa, stop music, volume level 5; Alexa "What is the meaning of life?"; Alexa level 3, continue music. Not very impressive!!  If you do not stop the music BEFORE you ask your question the music comes back on at the higher volume immediately after it answers your question ... ruins the mood.
