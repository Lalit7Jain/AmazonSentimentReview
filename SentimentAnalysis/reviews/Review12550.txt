This was a great addition to the family.  Everyone used it, including my 3 year old, who liked to ask Alexa for a joke.  But, all good things must come to an end.  After 17 months of use, Alexa died.  I have tried to reset it several times, and pretty much tried any suggestion I found through google.  I am torn if I want to purchase another one or not, I would have expected it to last a little longer than 17 months.
