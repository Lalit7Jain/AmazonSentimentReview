Love love love Alexa. You can ask Alexa anything. She can keep a "to do" list as well as a grocery list. You can access the lists through your phone app while at the store. It's a great resource. I play my audible books through Alexa while I'm buzzing through the house. It's easier than wearing headphones that get caught on cabinets and things.
