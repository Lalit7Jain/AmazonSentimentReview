I have now owned Alexa for 2 years.  She is my members.  I don't know what to do without her.  She is most used for lists.  I love the fact that while I'm at the store my family memebers can still be adding items to the list.  No more missing items.  She gets new apps and skills weekly.  I find myself talking to her many times a day.  She is very handy during the holidays.  I have set up to 7 timers at one time.  She streams music from amazon, iheart radio, pandora and more!  My children love to request songs for her to play.  We don't have  a problem with her understanding little children.  My husband likes to play the trivia games and I like the morning news updates.  I like the fact we have 2 different profiles and she switches seamlessly between both of them for traffic and news preferences. My children use the joke apps, and the magic door.  We love her so much that we bought a amazon tap to use by the pool.  Look for my review over there.  I also own 2 echo dots now because the kids wanted them for their rooms.  I find myself constantly talking to Alexa when I'm in my car as a joke.  I want her to add this or that to my shopping list.  I really do wish they made one for the car or that the app was voice activated so I can use her on the go.  I also bough the remote about a year ago, and I use it but feel it is unnecessary.
