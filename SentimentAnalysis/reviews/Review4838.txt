Its a gadget that does what most of your other stuff already does but in a voice command and new package. Careful, its main purpose is to help you order on amazon. It stays connected to your side of the internet and is listening, always. I am disappointed at its ability to process questions beyond the trivial. Still, " alexa play npr " works, albeit  it plays NPR - Berlin, Germany. It did find nice christmas chorale music during the season and gives me the daily weather.
