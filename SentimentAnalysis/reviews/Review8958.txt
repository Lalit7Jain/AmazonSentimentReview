Playing music:  Amazon Music isn't free unless one is a Prime Member.  Pandora requires an account, which is to be expected, but is free.  I haven't tried the other services.  My Music Library is frustrating to use.  Songs appear that I haven't played or uploaded, and I can't figure out how to delete what I don't want.
