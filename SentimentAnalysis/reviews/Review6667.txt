Received as a gift. Honestly, did not get the hype surrounding this thing before, but now that I've had it for about a week, I can't imagine being without it. This thing truly is amazing! For one, the voice analyzer is far superior to Siri (and I'm a self-proclaimed Applephile), and has a much broader range. TuneIn for local stations, Spotify & Prime for playlists (not to mention my entire Prime library) and instant traffic and weather are things I never knew I was missing. Lastly, the sound from such a small unit is far superior than you'd imagine. Highly recommend... especially if you're a notorious multi-tasker (or lazy) like me.
