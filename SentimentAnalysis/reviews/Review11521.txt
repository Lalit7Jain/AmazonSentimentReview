I used to love this Echo. However, in less than a year now, the bluetooth keeps getting cut off, even WITHIN 2 FEET DISTANCE! When I disconnect the music flows with no problem, so it is not the problem with internet or Mac. So bothering, now I stop listening/using Echo for music altogether, which was the original reason I bought for. I will check with Amazon and see what they can do. I will update.
