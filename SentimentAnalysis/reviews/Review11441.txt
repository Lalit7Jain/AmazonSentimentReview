Alexa is great for some things like playing music or news.  My largest gripe is that all the extra skills require me to remember wording.  All her skills have a name so you have to say "Alexa ask blahblah skill to lookup a recipe" or something like that.  You can't just make the simple request.  Even asking it to make a fart sound requires you saying the skill name.  Too much trouble.  There's NO WAY I can remember the name of all these services and skills and I don't want to spend that time memorizing all those phrases.  I tried hooking  up to my Honeywell  wifi thermostat and ran into  issues.  I'm in IT and technical but it was just too much trouble to get working correctly.  Right now it's  a fancy news player and bluetooth speaker.
