I got the Echo for Christmas and It can control six of my light switches and two of my thermostats. I have used the shopping list twice. The music is fantastic too. I have used the skills set to order pizza among other things. I am thrilled to be a owner of the Amazon Echo. There is so much it is capable of doing and I have just gotten started.
