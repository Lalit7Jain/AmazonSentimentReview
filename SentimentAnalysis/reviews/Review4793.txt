The Amazon Echo is an excellent product.  The refurbished one I bought appeared to be brand new with no indication at all that it had been used.  It works perfectly, easily hears my voice and provides feedback quickly.  I have liked the Echo so much I purchase brand new one in White for each of my daughters for Christmas.  I highly recommend the Echo.
