My greatest surprise was the sound quality.  I am not familiar with the current state of high fidlity audio, but I considered myself an audiofle in the 80's and 90's and experienced some of the highest quality music reproduction available at that time.  Irrespective of its size, this device produces some of the best sound quality I have experienced in 20 years.
