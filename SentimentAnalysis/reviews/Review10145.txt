I have now tried twice to have Amazon replace this defective unit (it repeatedly goes mute - no sound output at all), and twice the customer service reps have said something to the effect of, "Reset the device, and I'll call you back tomorrow to see how things are." Amazon never calls back, and my device is still defective. The second CSR even acknowledged that the first CSR should have called back, since they have record of the first call in their files. Then, he left me hanging just like the first.
