Two years later my Amazon Echo has become hard of hearing. It's located in the same spot nothing has changed around it. I have reset is back to factory and that worked for a couple of weeks. Now that I have 2 Echo Dots also I see how bad it has become. I can be 5 feet away and speaking directly at it (the reg Echo) and the echo dot 30 plus feet away in a different direction will hear and respond.
