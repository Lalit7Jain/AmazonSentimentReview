We love our Echo and how it has wiggled its way into our lifestyle. There isn't a hour/day/ that goes by that she (Alexa) isn't tasked with doing something. Setup is so easy, anyone who can read and follow directions will successfully have their Echo up and running with minimal time and effort.  We have integrated her into our home with many, many compatible devices which work flawlessly and are making plans for further expansion. The sky is the limit!!!  We especially enjoyed all the Christmas Music, from Amazon Music, we listened to during the Holidays. Just remember, when you loose your internet connection, she will not function.  So, you'll have to fall back to the old fashion method of using a switch.
