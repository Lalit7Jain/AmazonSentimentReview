I love my Echo. I've had it over a year. I'm tech savy and have a smart home. I use Smart Things hub, Phillips Hue, Harmony remote, Ecobee thermostat, Rain Machine for my yard watering, Ring doorbell, Wemo & Belkin outlets, etc. It's cool to tell Alexa (Echo) to turn my tv on or off, living room lights, outside lights, etc. on or off. She is occasionally stubborn but 90%+/- of the time she's right on. She great with weather forecasts, music, talk radio (iHeart & Tunein) and basically running the house. She can find my phone if i lose it. Use IFTTT to set up commands. Let me tell you, the future is here now....
