Really like the Echo (own this and 3 dots), but the Echo I've had for 2 years now is not working very well any more.  Without explanation, it won't respond to inquiries; the blue light still goes on, but it does not respond.  Then when I yank the plug and plug back, it reboots then works for a little while (less than a day), then stops responding again.  Maybe Alexa has become moody.  ;-).
