After a year or so of owning this i have to say im a fan of it then im not my remote has now died and wont work tryed everything i can do my echo heats up bad when it in use and now that its being fazed out by new one i feel like i should have waited for the new ones. so beside the remotes going out and heating up i guess it an okay speaker just dont expect good audio out of it
