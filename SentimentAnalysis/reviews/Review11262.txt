There is no "I" in the Echo's AI. This keyword based Amazon shopping engine has a looooonnnggg way to go. Great for spitting out weather and news; great for setting alarms and cooking timers. Used to great for playing music, until Amazon decided Jeff Bezos isn't rich enough and decided to try a squeeze monthly fees out of Prime members. Not so great at listening for commands if the volume is above 4, and it seems to be getting worse. Yes, I will be buying Googles Home to see how they compare, I am not a "captive customer" and will switch eco-systems if another serves me better.
