Please, someone, come up with something with similar features to Alexa but that actually functions better than a middle-aged switchboard operator!  I cannot wait to get drunk and throw Alexa….that blankety blank blank bank…..out of my 4th story window and watch her shatter to pieces on the sidewalk below (obviously not harming passersby - unless they are susceptible to 1937-style technology).
