All that said,  if you have some smart home wifi devices in house that Alexa supports you'd like to be able to control w your voice, or if you enjoy voice controlled streaming music from Pandora, IHeart, & a number of other online music sources, or you just wanna be able to know what the weather or daily news is wo getting out of your chair, and you've been thinking about getting an Echo, by all means do it!  You'll be glad you did!  Enjoy!!
