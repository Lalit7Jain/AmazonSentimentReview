Arrived really fast, was going to gift it to myself for Christmas but I couldn't resist. Easy set up, Alexa picks up your voice easily and the speaker sounds really nice. Only downfall would be the app, it often crashes and I find myself having to close it and reopen it just to change a song on my phone sometimes, it doesn't affect the device one bit as you can easily do that with voice control, but just thought that I'd mention that. Other than that, I love my Echo!
