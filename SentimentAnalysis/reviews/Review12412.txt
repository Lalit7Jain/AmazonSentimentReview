I now have purchased 3 echos, and while I love having Alexa in the house with us, there are a few key features left to be desired. While the product is a game-changer, Google home has some better features. I'm likely going to expand with a six pack of dots if Amazon can catch up to google in the next 3-6 months, otherwise I may go 'home' since I already have a number of Chromecast devices. Amazon needs to improve in a few key areas (in order of priority)...
