I use the echo mostly to control my lights and events through my automation system (HomeSeer).  Other than that I don't use it for too much else.  Most of the questions that my family asks are answered about half of the time. (Google Home seemed to be better at answering questions out of the box).  We check occasional news, weather and facts.  Hopefully in the future with more updates Alexa & Echo will improve.
