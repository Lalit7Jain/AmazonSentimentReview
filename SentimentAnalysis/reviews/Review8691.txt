Owned for a year now. What would I do without it?  When I am having a hard time getting up and don't want to move even a finger in my warm comfy bed I ask and get answers to "Alexa what is the weather today? Alexa did Green Bay win last night? Alexa give me the latest news (the one that leaves out "celebrities"). Then I usually ask Alexa to play a song, dependent on the answers to those questions, that moves me to get out of bed and dance. : )  Gave as gift to elderly relative who lives alone and she learned quickly how to Echo her for jokes and trivia games and spelling and in a strange way, but no doubt the way of our future, for companionship.
