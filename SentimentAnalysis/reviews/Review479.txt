I got one as a birthday present. In theory it can do cool stuff, but good luck making it happen. It's terrible at pairing on bluetooth-- I spent 45 min trying to get my 1-year-old laptop to pair with it, and even then, it's iffy. The app is not intuitive and has lots of sub-sub-sub-sub menus that are hard to navigate, and it works inconsistently (like trying to pair my new work phone!). I'd have preferred a "home" gadget from the big "G" company....
