The Tap cannot be used for streaming unless a wireless connection is available.  I wouldn't recommend connecting via an unsecured connection so unless you have a secure, mobile wireless connection, the Echo Tap is nothing more than an expensive, portable bluetooth speaker which you can purchase for much less than the cost of an Echo Tap.
