We use Alexa to set alarms, set timers, add things to the grocery list, listen to the morning news flash, turn on or off lights in the house, lock the doors at night, change the thermostat, and listen to music.  Alexa is the best!  We have had very few problems with her and when we do it is usually because someone pushed her too close to the wall.  Very enjoyable product.  Best parts are connectivity with WEMO, Wink, Pandora, IFTTT!  Looking forward to picking up some Dots soon too.  Kinda feels like maybe we will be living like the Jetsons one day!
