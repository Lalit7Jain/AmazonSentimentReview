I will add a Echo Dot this week to the master bedroom.  That way when I open my eyes in the morning I can tell Echo to turn on the good morning scene and I'll be set to wake up.  I love this thing in conjunction my my Nexia system and my Harmony remote/hub.  If you have a smart home hub that works with Amazon Echo you should add the Echo to your system.  You will not regret it.  This device takes home automation to the next level.
