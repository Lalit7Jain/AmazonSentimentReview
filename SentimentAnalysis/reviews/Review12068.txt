The Amazon Echo was a birthday gift from my husband and son tonight. It's only taken a few minutes to get it plugged in. Their really isn't any set up to speak of. Once plugged in and placed onto a flat surface you only need to know to say " Alexa" and the task you want to do. This is super easy! Ask her to read the books you've got on Kindle or Audible. Find the perfect raido station online, set your wake up alarm, Get your news or sport report and plenty of additional tasks are withen Alex's reach.
