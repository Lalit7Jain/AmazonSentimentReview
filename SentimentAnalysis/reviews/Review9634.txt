I am some what disappointed however I will keep it..Pretty good speaker for listening to music; however I didn't realize you have to download apps to get Alexa to do most things...I ask for a simple chicken dinner recipe and Alexa didn't understand..Once I downloaded several apps it does respond but then it sends you an email of the recipe..Also the same thing happens with the news ....I assumed ( guess that's my mistake ) that it pulled info automatically out of the cloud once I connected it to my wifi...So its ok for music, but just be prepared to have to enable several apps for you to utilize this device...and BTW I am a huge Amazon customer and fan! So this still needs work...I also purchased the dot...(black Friday deal!) and was surprised the speaker on it is not as bad  some reviews have stated...It has the same functionality as the Echo....So if you want to save over $100 just purchase the dot....I hooked mine up to my Bose and it sounds awesome..I will say however that the echo has an almost equal sound
