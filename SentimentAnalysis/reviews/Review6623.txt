I really like the Echo so far, but it seems there is a lot to learn to get the most benefit (remembering exactly how to phrase your request to access the appropriate skill). I have mostly used it to keep up my grocery list, weather updates and news briefings. My husband has been a bit frustrated because most of his questions to Alexa result in her not being able to answer, and most of his questions should have been easily answered by searching the web. Perhaps it takes a special "skill" which we haven't found or downloaded yet. I will continue to use it and love it, but my husband isn't quite as enamored with it as I am.
