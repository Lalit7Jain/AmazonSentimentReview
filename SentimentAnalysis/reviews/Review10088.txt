1.  As an audiophile, I can only say that the sound quality is passable, but by no means is it on par with Bose or Klipsch minispeaker systems.  DO NOT let this put you off of the Echo.  It is not bad at all for ambient music, but it won't be your go-to for party music.  My wife uses the Echo exclusively.  She's perfectly happy with the audio quality and methods to choose what she wants to listen to.
