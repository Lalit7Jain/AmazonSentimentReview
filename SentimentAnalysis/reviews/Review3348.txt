Do not buy one until Amazon figures out why they loose connectivity. Worked great for a month, now it looses connectivity to my high speed cable internet. Phones, tablets, and tv work just fine but not this damn thing. The window to send it back closed 6 days ago so now I have an expensive paperweight.
