She is great with most straight forward questions but does get stumped on some along the way...She is far from a know it all, but she knows quite a bit. She is like us though, again she is always learning so she will only get better. She is great for helping to keep things organized! Grocery list, calendar, alarms and more....One feature that would have been nice, since she does have microphones, would have been making and answering calls while bluetooth connected to the phone....At the very least to allow to answer calls through ECHO...It just makes it a great hands-free option for someone like me that may be typing away at the keyboard.
