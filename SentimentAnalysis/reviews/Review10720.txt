I totally love it, as does my husband.  I get any music I want just by saying "alexa, play Sinatra" or I can name a particular song.  It is a timer, a purchasing tool, and it answers questions to settle little disagreements.  ha!  You can get sports scores, everything.  For a small device, everyone who sees it says the speaker is superb - and it is.  I'm buying more for gifts.  It is just wonderful.  It is easy to set up also.  You do need Wi-Fi in your home, but that is all - it walks you through the set up.  Go get one!!!
