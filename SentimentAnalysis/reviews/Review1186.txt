I was a touch intimidated when I decided to try to make my home a little smarter and then being able to use Echo to be able to control everything by voice. I now have an Echo, Dot, Nest thermostat, and several Philips Hue lights set up. Things to try if you haven't- jeopardy, though you only get 6 questions a day. Rules for games (when the kids can't agree Alexa can settle the argument), "good morning", she'll let you know what's going on that day, flash briefing-customize it to your liking, you won't be disappointed, Akinator (sp?)- it may take more than 20 questions but she's probably going to get it right (even guessed Louise Belcher from Bob's Burgers correctly), weather, sports, conversions, and even recipes. I haven't even scratched the surface of potential. Worth it. The Dot is just as functional, the only real difference being sound quality.
