I ordered Echo specifically for music - I’ve had a huge music library on Amazon for years. But it didn’t take long after installing Echo to find out that there is now an annual charge for having over 250 songs, so only a small portion of my library is available. But OK - since subscription is to be expected these days, I decided to pare down my library down to fit and get Echo to play only the songs that are free.
