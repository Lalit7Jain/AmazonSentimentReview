Amazing!!!! Hands down (literally, no button pushing required) the coolest thing in my house! Sound is very clear. My husband got this for me since we have a 6 month old and he works away from home 5 days out of the week. With just my voice command my baby and I can jam out as we walk in the door! Need soothing music for bed time... you got it! Bath time music but your hands are wet and full with baby..... no worries just tell Alexa to play you're favorite music! Don't forget it helps to have Amazon prime with free music.... but also, you can connect it to your pandora and Spotify accounts! The possibilities are endless!
