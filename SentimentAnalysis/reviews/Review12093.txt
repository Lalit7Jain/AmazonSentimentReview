Not impressed, should have saved money and will be going with google. I am not a die hard techie although my husband is. I also do not concentrate on the "specs" but rather the functionality. Having to download "skills" is annoying. I can't just ask Alexa whatever...she responds with her ever popular..." I am sorry I didn't understand your question" . Maybe I am used to Siri on the iPad or Ok google on the phone...don't know. Neither of us really like Alexa and maybe as a stater she's okay but way too much room for improvement.
