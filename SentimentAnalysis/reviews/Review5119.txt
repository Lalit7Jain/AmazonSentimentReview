I bought the Amazon Echo as a gift for my husband.  Unfortunately, it did not live up to our expectations, and we are returning it.  The main functions we wanted were to play music, help organize grocery lists, and for general inquiries such as weather, traffic, and sports.  My husband in particular wanted to be able to do the equivalent of googling for updates to various sports scores.  Unfortunately, only the music function was decent.  For groceries, you have to command Alexa individually for every item, one at a time.  And you can't delete items by voice command.  But the biggest disappointment for my husband was the inability to ask Alexa for a particular sports event score (i.e. College bowl championship).  And it doesn't recognize PGA at all - couldn't provide leaderboard info for a major PGA tournament.  Generally, we found the entire setup to be very limited when compared to Siri or Googling online.  And the traffic skill was particularly pathetic.  You can put exactly one destination in (ever) and it permanently updates you on that traffic only.  What if you and your husband work in different locations and both want to know about the commute?  And what if you want traffic information to a particular destination on a one-time basis (i.e. airport!).  Nope.  Can't do it.  I hope Amazon (or Google for that matter) can refine the technology because the voice activated tool was a very exciting prospect because neither of us like typing into the phone app when we need something.  But to be useful it has to be more flexible.
