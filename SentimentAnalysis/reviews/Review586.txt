Good product. Search engine is terrible because it uses bing.  On the app you can see what she heard and she always hears the correct statement but cant ever find it because Bing is a bad search engine. Use it as speakers quite often and sound quality is great.  Kind of fun to just talk with her sometimes and very convenient when cooking because she can store multiple timers. Also can be very loud if you turn up volume. Want to get some of the add-ons so I can control lights in the house. Alexa has lots of extra features like the light/appliance control, this seems to be what the product is geared towards. That and music.
