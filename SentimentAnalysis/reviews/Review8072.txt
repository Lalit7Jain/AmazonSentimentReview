I quickly found that I love the sound quality that comes out of this compact gadget.  There are so many features I still have to explore, but I love that it links to my amazon music as well as other music streams like I heart Radio.  I have done away with the stereo system and enjoy the new space I have.  The only thing I would love to see is that it could go wireless so that I can take it outside with me and not worry about a plug.
