The Echo is placed in my bedroom less than 20ft from the wireless router. I have a very stable connection and as a tech-lover I use a range of devices that really test and confirm that statement. However Echo is constantly losing connection when I give a command or saying she doesn't understand a command she understood in the same setting ten minutes earlier. Probably the most unnerving part is having to listen to echo say 'sorry I cannot connect right now, please check the settings in your alexa app'. When it is losing connection 3 or more times a day that message gets really obnoxious and there ought to be a way to turn it off. This of course leads to hundreds of connect then reconnect, power down, move closer to the router,and move anything that may cause disturbance to only have the same problem in a short while. Calls to support lead to little more advice than doing what I already have tried.
