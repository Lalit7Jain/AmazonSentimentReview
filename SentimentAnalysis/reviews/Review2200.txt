It was very easy to set up.  The sound of her voice is quite pleasant.  She does give information and answer questions, but many times the answer is that she can't give the answer.  Duh!  She is great in my kitchen area for setting Timers or Alarms.  The sound is surprisingly good while playing music.  She is a wonderful Weather Gal.  I enjoy her keeping my Shopping List.  Unfortunately, she can not at this time print my list to my Wireless Printer, so I have to walk around the grocery store with my phone in my hand.  I tried printing my list off Amazon's website on my computer, and it was underwhelming--and a real waste of paper.  And a waste of the time it  took to crank up my laptop.
