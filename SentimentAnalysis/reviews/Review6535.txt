huge device, get the battery base for it.  that includes a usb port for charging your phone, a necessity  if this device takes up the outlet.  very costly way of turning on/off lights, switches are faster, easier, cheaper.  just flip the wall switch.  one of the few ways it pays for itself is making it possible to turn on lights coming into a dark house, and not having to guess where the light switch is.  music is only mono, and no blue tooth.  jokes are less funny as you get farther down the list.  you have to pause after using the wake-up word "alexa".  can't just whip out an instruction, it blends with the wake-up word, and alexa won't respond.  not every device you may want to control is available right now.  it might be better to wait until more vendors get involved to make more products that go with this.  it can cost hundreds of dollars to purchase all the needed accessories.
