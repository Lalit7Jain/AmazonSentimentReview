Alexa can't answer simple questions.  I hope it is because it is relatively new compared to "Ok Google" and "Siri". This is not AI, The majority of your questions will get the answer "Hmm I can't answer that question" or "Check out the Bing results in the Alexa App". 1. Why can't I change it to use Google 2. Just read the first few response on the search results. 3. Stop telling be to look at the Alexa app, If I wanted to use my phone I would have done that to begin with.
