I have to scream at the unit before it will respond.  It's not making my life easier, it's making it more difficult.  I also bought an echo unit, hoping it would help.  I've read the user manuals and nothing seems to help.  If this is cutting edge, Cortana works better.  That being said, I am waiting for Amazon to provide some type of tech assistance in real time versus email to deal with this issue before I send both items back.
