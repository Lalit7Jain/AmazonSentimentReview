I got the Amazon Echo on the first day it came out and it was great.  Now a couple years later it doesn't respond at all or will be really slow, it skips playing songs, and sometimes it will start talking to itself.  Amazon customer service spent some time troubleshooting the unit and after about 20 minutes said it needed to be replaced and offered me a $20 discount on a new model as it was out of warranty.  No thanks!
