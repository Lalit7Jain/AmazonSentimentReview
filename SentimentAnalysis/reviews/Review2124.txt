The weather, the time, distances, science... how much does the earth weigh? Alexa will tell you... as well as the weight of a hydrogen atom. She's cute, she's funny, and can be downright insulting... with the right app. (I disabled that app... too much like having my ex-wife around... I'm not sayin' I didn't deserve it, just don't like having my nose rubbed in it.) I've even used Alexa to help with crossword puzzles. Shopping lists, 'to do' lists, adds events to your calendar. I haven't even scratched the surface.
