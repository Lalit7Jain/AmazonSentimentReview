Amazon help-desk requires that you buy an adapter. That's right - you have to buy a part to replace their (possibly) defective part.  After asking how that made sense (me having to buy something to replace a defective part that I already bought), was told that Amazon would credit me the value of the part after I bought it. So now I wait a few days for a part that might or might not work after paying for it and having to apply a credit.
