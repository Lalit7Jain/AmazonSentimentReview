Alexa has made the work of home much more interesting and fun for our family. We are super busy and move fast. Adding items to the shopping list is effortless now and the kids can all easily throw items on the list without having to find the darn list. We all have our own Alexa action favorites. Good job Amazon. Looking forward to see how this product evolves. Makes my Prime membership more valuable.
