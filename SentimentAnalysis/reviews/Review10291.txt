Alexa's voice recognition (turning that signal into recognized speech) is pretty good.  It seems better than my daughter's iPhone, but not as good as my Samsung/Google phone.  I suspect this is the context part of the software that Google is just better at, but my phone also can't do that well without an internet connection so there is some backend processing at work.  The Alexa app frequently (but not always) will show you what it heard and give you some chance to provide feedback on it.
