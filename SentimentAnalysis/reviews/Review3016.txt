Purchased this solely to play music from my personal library stored on Amazon Music.  I have no interest in ordering a pizza or turning lights on and off, I just want to hear MY music.  Alexa is totally unable to deal with this.  I ask to play something in a given genre from my library and she gives me a radio station instead, or just as likely, gives absolutely no response whatsoever.  So I am reduced to using the third rate Alexa app to get what I want.  Not even remotely what I expected from this device.  Sound quality is excellent, but Alexa is dumber than a box of rocks.  And the light ring is quite annoying, particularly when the mic is muted and it turns red and is bright enough to light up a room.  Should be a way to dim that or turn it off.  And for the price Amazon could spend 5 cents to include some written documentation instead of forcing you to log in and search around to find the device FAQs which MIGHT be able to answer a question or two.  Since I have to use my phone to control Echo I would be better off just using one of those small Bluetooth speakers or just connecting to my main stereo by Bluetooth. Disappointed, to say the least.
