First of all it's like Siri, except it works. The speaker quality is mood changing. The ability for Alexa to hear me from very far away is stunning. I love asking what time it is in the middle of the night. It is absolutely the best thing I have ever purchased. I will get another one, and I just bought the battery for my first one.
