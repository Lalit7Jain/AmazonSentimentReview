4 hours to try to get this device set up including calling Xfinity & Amazon, resetting the router, having Xfinity reset the router, uninstalling and reinstalling alexa, restarting my iPhone several times and no way to connect this to Xfinity's router. This should be plug and play and not HOURS worth of aggravation. Alexa my dear, you are getting jammed back in the box and sent back. Worst "i really do not need it but it looks cool" gadget I have ever bought
