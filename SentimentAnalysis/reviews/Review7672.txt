Alexa (that's her name) reminds my husband (twice a day) to take his medication.  He listens to her alarm to take medication, but he would ignore me. You can  tell her to add something to your shopping list, and the item is magically placed on a list on your cell phone.  Alexa will answer questions, play an amazing amount of popular and obscure music (Amalia Rodrigues Portuguese Fado music), tell you silly jokes, recite the Gettysburg Address, turn other devices on or off, and give you the news.  Her talents are almost endless.  It's both a really practical and a really fun device.
