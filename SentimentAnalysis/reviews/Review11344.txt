I got a Echo and I really love it. I got it because it can read my Kindle books but when going into the list of Kindle books it drives me CRAZY CRAZY CRAZY did I say CRAZY cause that's what I meant, that there is no search bar so I have to scroll like a mad person to find the book that Alexia was reading.  Does anyway know if there is a better way or another option?
