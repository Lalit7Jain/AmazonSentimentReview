The Echo has impressed me from the day I received it and set it up.  Still learning all the tasks that 'Alexa' is capable of performing - and more abilities/apps are added every week.  She is the perfect 'digital assistant' - searches for news updates, sports scores and plays both my music library, as well as the Amazon Prime catalog (with a Prime membership account).  Still considering the Amazon unlimited library - for only $3.99 per month - music access to the entire Amazon music catalog is available - for less than $50 a year, I can listen to more music than I can remember!
