There is not a lot of documentation that comes with the device, but the internet is rife with information.  For example I was frustrated that the Echo was in my name so it could not use my wife's music prime access....but then I did some reading and learned I could set up a profile for her on the device and then get access.  By that time I had set up spotify (you have to pay for it though) as the default...which has opened a wide variety of music.
