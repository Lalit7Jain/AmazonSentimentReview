Died on me 2 month after out of warranty.  They won't replace..  Even I have been having same issue with the device.  On my third power adaptor..  they seem to think that will fix it but my echo keeps shorting out the power adaptor.  Bought the white one..  guess what died again.  Save your money and buy the echo dot.
