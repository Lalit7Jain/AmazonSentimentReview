This thing is an incredible piece of technology. However, I have my fears that it may actually be an agent of Skynet. For that reason sometimes I don't trust it. Regardless, the Amazon Echo delivers amazing sound quality with TONS of features and connectivity abilities. Being able to connect to other devices in your home is super simple and easy to accomplish; making the Echo all the more impressive. I highly recommend it, however I also recommend keeping your distance if your name is either Sarah or John Connor.
