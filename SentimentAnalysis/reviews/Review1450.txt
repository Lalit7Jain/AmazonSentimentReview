As a fairly tech-savvy person (I work in tech) and after reading rave reviews of the Echo (also hearing them from friends), I took the plunge and purchased one. I have to admit I'm mystified and willing to admit it might just be me, but this seems like a completely useless and often annoying adjunct to the tech currently in my home. I can look things up faster on my phone or computer, my phone apps do a better job than the ones currently compatible with the Echo (including things like news headlines, movie times, traffic, weather and public transport reports, meditation guidance, the whole gamut). I already have decent, wifi/Bluetooth compatible speakers and Echo's ability to have my Kindle books read to me (a feature I was excited about before purchasing) turns out to mean I get to hear them spoken out loud in a flat toneless voice, which is not exactly appealing or helpful. In addition, I feel I have to almost shout to have my voice picked up by the Echo (unpleasant) and the email updates from Amazon on how people are using the device are frankly creepy (I mean, I already know they're collecting and aggregating data, but having that fact routinely thrust in my face isn't appreciated.) I'm glad most people love it (it's the wave of the future, after all), but I'm really sorry that I spent the money and then waited too long to return it-there are more enjoyable things to do with $200.
