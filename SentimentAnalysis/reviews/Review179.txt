the echo design team went and made setup so simple and automated a child could do it. you will need to download the alexa app from android or amazon. i cannot say for apple as i left their closed ecosystem years ago. that said once you have alexa installed you can start the setup process or i should say alexa will do it for you. FYI i pulled an Einstein move whilst setting up mine, forgot to turn on bluetooth duh. when echo/alexa told me there was a problem connecting and then told me exactly where to go and what to do to make it right! no need to troubleshot. but you do need the bluetooth enabled so the network information etc is cloned to the echo device and you need not enter any of it in. once that is done your wifi network is set, good to go and so are you.
