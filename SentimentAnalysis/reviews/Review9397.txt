So far, I've really enjoyed using the Echo for various tasks... especially music! The one complaint I have is that with some song names (i.e. Dragon Slayer and Road Trip by NSP and various other songs in my library), Echo won't play the song and will instead redirect you to some other song, album, or artist. It's quite annoying, but not the end of the world. You CAN go into your amazon music library through the alexa app and play any song from there, but that kind of defeats the purpose of the whole voice operating thing. Anyways, if you're going to utilize ALL of the features of Echo and not just music, I say it's an overall fantastic buy!
