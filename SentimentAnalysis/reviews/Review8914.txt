We bought Echoes last year for ourselves plus for all 3 of our children's families.We get a lot of use from it. More features and abilities are added by Amazon all the time and you can now buy things from Amazon Prime right from your Echo. It doesn't take up much counter space at all. It is easy to play music and you can ask "Alexa" to lower or raise the volume or stop and start again.
