The sound is very good on this and it looks great on the shelf, but I was disappointed that it can not answer most of my questions.  I have read through all of the apps available on the Alexa app and enabled those that have some substance to them.  However, if I want good, hard-core information, I find myself reaching for Siri.  Overall it has been somewhat of a disappointment.  I will keep looking for new apps that might be smarter so please keep working on this devise.
