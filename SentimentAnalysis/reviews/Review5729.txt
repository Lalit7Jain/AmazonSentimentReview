Received as a Christmas gift.  Not sure what the buzz is about, as it doesn't appear to do much of anything that can't be done easier/better on a computer or phone.  The music options (unless you want to pay extra for Amazon Prime or whatnot) are limited.  It can't answer questions of any real complexity.  There are no audio outputs, which means you can't use headphones, or attach speakers to it.  Instead, you are limited to the built-in speaker (which doesn't provide true stereo sound).  Prefacing every command with, "Alexa..." becomes quite annoying rather quickly.  Not portable, as it must be plugged in at all times (no battery).  Just sort of... meh.
