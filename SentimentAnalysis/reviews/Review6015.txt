The most obvious people who would love Echo and Alexa are those who want a new home speaker and are also intrigued by voice control. My parents bought an Echo months ago, and my mother uses it mostly to play Justin Timberlake albums during the day. While my parents love the Echo's speaker, they purchased it with my brother in mind. He's autistic and speaks choppily, making him sometimes hard to understand. He'll speak to Alexa, ask her questions about the weather, and if Alexa responds, my parents know his speech is improving.
