UPDATE: Got tired of waiting for Amazon Echo to support Bluetooth speakers. I took advantage of the sale on Google Home and Chromcast audio. With a small amp, I repurposed a couple of sets of unused stereo speakers, connected them to the Google Home with the Chromecast audio and I have great sound in multiple rooms. The Echo will likely move into the office outside of the main living areas.
