I think I was expecting a bit more from what all my friends of said but overall have enjoyed it.  Although her favorite catchphrases I'm sorry I don't have the answer for the question lol.  I would like to be able to change her name from Alexa to something of my choosing.  In all fairness though in the short time I've  owned it  I have seen a few improvements already so Amazon is constantly improving this  Device
