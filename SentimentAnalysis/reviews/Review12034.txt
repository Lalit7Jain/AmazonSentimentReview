My husband bought as a birthday gift and I must say I believe it to be very expensive since it is not even portable- I can't believe in this day and age this is not wireless.  I was sure I could carry it around room to room without plugging it in.  But  no it always needs to be plugged in- wow that makes this a $175 paper weight- also after being plugged in all night needed to reboot to speak to us again. If  you have an iPhone with SIRI and a cheap wireless speaker you are probably better off
