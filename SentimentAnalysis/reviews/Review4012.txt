I just love this I use this for most of my music and the weather.  I have a Tap also and I can't seem to get it to play music for me, but she has a better perssonality thank the Echo.  I know I just need to find out how to work the Tap, I want to take it in other rooms while leaving the Echo pluged into one place,
