I had hoped this would work with the new generation of Amazon FireTVstick. If you follow my reviews, you'll know the 2017 FireTVstick was a complete bust for me until I completely rearranged my viewing setup so I didn't use the flexible HDMI connector and moved it to a TV where the wifi signal is very strong (86%).
