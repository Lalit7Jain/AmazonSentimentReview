We've tried lots of options for our music..Sirius XM in the home, intercom system and even a battery operated radio, but we love the Amazon Echo. Sound is fantastic, easy to set up. Or favorite family game now is to take turns coming up with favorite old songs and singing and dancing to them (with our grade school aged kids). Kids love the morning "joke" -- especially Groundhog Day, and I've loved the timer and calendar uses. Well worth the price.
