NOT AS EASY AS THEY CLAIM. Vulnerable to misuse and hacking. Unable to return although I brought it to Amazons attension  shortly after receiving the item. To bad, I used to like Amazon, but now any more. Third party orders are not worth the hassle. Although this was not a third party order it is just another nail in the coffin. I will be very selective in the future.HHH
