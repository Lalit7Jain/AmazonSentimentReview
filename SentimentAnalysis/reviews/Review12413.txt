1) Have my echos & dots speak to each other and enable MULTI-ROOM AUDIO. This is incredibly important because I already have speakers all over the place (bluetooth, in-wall, beats, etc - not wasting money on sonos) and I'd like a way to play my music throughout the house/car or tell my kids to come to dinner and simultaneously have Alexa disable their devices from across the house (oooh, broadcast mode - with parental controls of course).
