Got the echo on Black Friday. Amazon had a great $139 deal on this thing and I couldn't pass it up. I gave it to my parents for Christmas. So far it works great. I like how Alexa pretty much knows anything from spelling a word to how the weather is outside. It's amazing. Now having to go to your phone or computer everything you want to know something. Just ask away.  She is neat and smart! No complaints so far.
