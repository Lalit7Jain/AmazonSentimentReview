I planned to use this device as a bluetooth speaker for my bedroom first and foremost and a smart home device second. I paired it up with my Phillips Hue Smart lights and that works just fine. However, when I pair it up with my smart phone via bluetooth, all kinds of issues arise. The audio, when streamed via bluetooth from my phone is always stuttering and cuts in and out. If the audio cuts out for more than 30 seconds, the bluetooth automatically disconnects. Furthermore, when my phone is paired up via bluetooth, for some reason it makes the wifi connection on my phone super slow to the point where I can't even load the comments on a website nor load images on reddit while streaming  audio. I known for a fact that it is not my internet connection or my phone because right when I unpair the bluetooth, my phone functions just normally. I have tried pairing my phone up with other bluetooth speakers and such issues to do occur. I am seriously considering the return on this product.
