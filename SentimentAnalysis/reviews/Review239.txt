So, Alexa is definitely smarter than OK Google, and less, um, hmmm, ah let's say dull/stupid/argumentative/inattentive/obtuse than Siri.  I haven't explored everything it can do yet but with an Echo and three dots in the house I am expecting her to earn her keep shortly.  Looking forward to Sonos integration and it better work with my existing Sonos boxes!!!
