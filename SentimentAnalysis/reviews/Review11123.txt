We have 2 of these now and I use them EVERY day. Once our power was out and I realized I couldn't ask Alexa, "What time is it? "Whats the weather?" "Alexa, play spotify". Or ANY of those other things I ask on a regular basis while getting ready, cooking dinner, cleaning, or any other time where I want to be hands off my phone or computer. We have one in the bedroom and one in the kitchen/living room and they have become a regular part of our routine to listen to music, find out news, the weather, whatever it is. The sound quality is also very good, and to be honest we have stopped using our Bose speaker because the sound quality is comparable and it is simply more convenient. Bluetooth pairing is very easy too, but with integrated support for Pandora and Spotify we never really need to use it.
