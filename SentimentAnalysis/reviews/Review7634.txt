I love this thing!  It arrived Saturday but with Christmas socializing and company I didn't set it up until today.  I'm listening to some of my favorite music right now and listened to NPR before that.  I can see myself using the Echo for sooooo many things.  Thanks, Amazon you've produced a winner.  Oh!  I should tell say that  I am not a techie type but setup was easy.
