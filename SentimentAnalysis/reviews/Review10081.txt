I bought this for a Bluetooth speaker.  I have a couple of Bluetooth speakers that really aren't very loud and are hard to pair.  This is very satisfactory in both regards.  It pairs easily with my Android phone and plays at a good volume.  Yesterday I was listening to Pandora and actually had to say, "Alexa, reduce volume." The volume reduction was immediate and met my requirements.  I haven't used many of the features  beyond Bluetooth, but when I asked for news, I got a five minute news report from my favorite station, so that was very cool.  It is rather pricey, but so far it has been a good addition to my life.  It is portable enough to take from the kitchen to the bedroom (I got the battery base).  Next I want to try bringing it in the car.  My car will pair with my phone, but I can't use voice control to ask for my Audible book or etc.
