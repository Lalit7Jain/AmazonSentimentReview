Programmers have done an initially good job but many improvements needed and many more apps (or skills) needed. On Jan. 3 she kept playing Christmas songs when I told her "easy songs."

Also they need different names or both start talking at the same time.  Consumers need the option of naming them what we want instead of "Amazon" "Echo" or "Alexa" which is way too limiting.
