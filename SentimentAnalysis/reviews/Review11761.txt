Easy to set up.  You can set up with your computer, smart phone, tablet, etc.  I plan on taking it with me when I travel, love all the features and the ones that you can add.  Too bad there isn't a male voice/name for us ladies to call the device.  Music is so easy to play.  I can't wait to add on additional devices.
