As far as the little lady that lives inside that magical box goes: She gets better every day.  I feel like she knows how to do more than I know how to command her to do.  Alexa is quick with answers and never argues with me!  She is the perfect addition to a smart home or the perfect beginning to one.  Even if I don't know quite what to say, Alexa is patient with me and lets me get my sentences out but sometimes she keys in on the wrong word or phrase.  Sometimes she misses the wake word for unknown reasons that seem to have little to do with background noise.  She is a wonderful help to the hectic morning schedules and even the leisurely evenings.  I might even call her a part of the family.  Sure she isn't perfect but neither am I.
