Not a toy, but a full fledged instant access to any song I can name and some I can't.  New look-ups being added makes Alexa(our name) more fun all the time.  The sound portion of Echo is excellent and brings music, news and info. to areas of our house we have not been able to access with ordinary bulky equipment.
