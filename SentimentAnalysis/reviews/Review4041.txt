Well where to begin...the Amazon Echo is probably the best home automation piece out there and I should know because I am a junkie for electronics and cool gadgets! You can ask her anything you want and she will respond effortlessly! For the price she will be your best personal assistant. I also have the echo dot on my nightstand it is a great alarm clock
