Purchased an Echo about 2 years ago & still have not figured out to load / save / input / whatever music on the thing. I HATE the fact that there was NO instructions with the purchase. That information has to be purchased separately .... oh joy. Yes there are some cheap booklets on the market ... but they tell you NOTHING!!!!!! So fed up with trying to figure this thing out!!!!  Note To Amazon: When selling something that requires instructions in order to operated it ... which is just about everything .... INCLUDE the instructions with it!!!!!!!!
