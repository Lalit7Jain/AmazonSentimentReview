I thought I loved this device. It was just what I needed. I bought it in November, I had an issue in May with power. They sent a replacement. It didn't seem to work as well. You had to call the name several times before it would answer on most occasions. I got pass that. I get up this morning and it will not come on at all. I still have 6 days on my warranty but they can't just send me a replacement. They have to get this one back then try to fix it and possibly return the same one saying it's fixed. In the meantime my 6 days of warranty will expire once I get that supposingly fixed one back. I don't understand why they can't ship a replacement and figure out their issue with this one without me having to wait 2-4 weeks for a replacement. I paid for something to last more than a year and I shouldn't have to wait for them to investigate their problem. The tech tells me I'm not the first to complain about this same issue. Really Now
