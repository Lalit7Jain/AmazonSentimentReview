My Amazon Echo/Dot review:  Just before Christmas I decided to join the hands free digital assistant revolution.  I ordered two Dots and an Echo for my 1002 square foot condo.  They were on sale but on back order – the projected delivery date was January 14th.  Okay, they’re for me, $10 off each Dot and $40 off the Echo, no rush.  I was pleasantly surprised to receive the Dots on December 26th and the Echo today (January 4th).  Set up was super easy.  I already had the app on my phone so it took no time for the Dots.
