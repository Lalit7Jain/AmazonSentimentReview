I think the Echo is a very innovative product and lots of fun to have.  Having said that, I was extremely disappointed to discover that the Echo has full compatibility with Google but not with Apple.  In order for someone to access their Calendar, Contacts or Appointments on Apple products you must go through a third party like FreeBusy.io  or Any.do.  Not what I wanted to do!
