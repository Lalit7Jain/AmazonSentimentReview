Awesome sound quality and I can give directions when my hands are full.  I love having the remote so I can just turn it down when I am on the phone.  Seems like Alexa needs to learn a few more commands.  I need to spend time exploring the other connections I can add.  Right now, I just use it for playing music and asking about the weather and headlines!  Cool product!
