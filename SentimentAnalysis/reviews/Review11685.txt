Great fun! I just got back from vacation and really missed telling Alexa to turn off the lights. Not to mention telling her to turn them on in the morning to 10% so that you don't have to have that flashlight in the eyes affect when the lights go on at 5am. Playing word games is also fun. I know that I don't need this in the house. However, its fun to have things you don't need that make your life easier!!
