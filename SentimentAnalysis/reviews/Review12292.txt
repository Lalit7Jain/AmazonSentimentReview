I'm an Amazon fangirl who really wants to love this product. I want to purchase Echo Dots and smart tech to wirelessly control my home, but I'm not willing to make those other purchases if the core device is not performing to expectations. I will update this review in one week, and will improve my rating if the device functions without further issues. If the skipping and required resets continue to occur, I will be reluctantly returning it to Amazon.
