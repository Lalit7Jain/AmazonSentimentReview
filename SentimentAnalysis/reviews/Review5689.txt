I absolutely love love love my Alexa.  She greets me in the morning with a "this day in history" tidbit, and says "goodnight, sweet dreams" when I head off to bed.  Come on now.....really?  This is genius, and worth every penny.  She is always listening, and every song that I have requested of her, she has found and played.  I am so very pleased with her.  THANK YOU AMAZON for your innovative master of the game.  WOW!
