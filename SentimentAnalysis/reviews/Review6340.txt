As far has the hardware goes I was disappointed to find that the most expensive version in the lineup does not have the ability to connect to Bluetooth receivers, it can only act as one.  That would be ok if the speaker quality was better but as BT a speaker she is about on par with a $49 off brand system found in discount stores. :(  She shines at music playback but the poor sound quality detracts from the experience.  I could opt for the Dot and connect to BT but the build quality just isn't the same.
