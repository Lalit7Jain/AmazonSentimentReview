I'm living in the Dominican Republic so I can't use all the services Alexa provides. (for example order at dominos) But this is an awesome device. I cook a lot at home. You can ask for timers and convert units just by asking. Its really cool. I also control all my light (Philips hue). It works just perfect and also dimming is fantastic to ask for. Way better than with Siri what I used before. Also the range of voice recognition is fantastic. The device is placed on my table in the living room. When I enter my apartment and ask for the entrance lights to turn on it works all the time. And this at a distance for about 7 meters. Also to play music its a wonderful device. Sound is great for what it is and loud enough for all my uses. Fast shipping as usual from amazon.
