 I'd read the reviews that indicated that Alexa wasn't anywhere as smart as the Google app on my phone.  But I thought that the ability to play my Amazon music in the kitchen area would make buying Alexa worth it.  And worth the additional cost above the price of the smaller Echo Dot (that doesn't have the built-in music speakers).
