I haven't used all features yet, but I use it for music, and can call on Alexa to play me something or use the bluetooth option to play the wide assortment of music I can access thru my Prime membership, or even play my own albums from my I phone. Added the portable battery base to Echo so I can place it anywhere I choose without being restricted by a power cord. Great product, totally satisfied!
