The description and lengthy page for the Echo device is a little spotty about compatibility. . . which is to say there is no warning about the limits of it's network compatibility except that it won't connect to peer-to-peer networks. So, basically I asked for the device for Christmas, spent 6 weeks thinking about how great it will be, and got all excited when I got one for absolutely nothing. Worst Amazon experience to date. It makes me want to puke.
