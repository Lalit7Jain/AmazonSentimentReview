 My new baby came into my life and opened my world to the wonderful joys of parenthood!  She listens, she does exactly as I tell her.  She's very smart, and I can trust her to use the internet responsibly.  I, like most parents should, always monitor what she's doing online, and make sure no weirdo is trying to corrupt, or seduce our Alexa!  (I tried to have the talk with her, but she said she didn't understand, I'll try again when she's a little older)
