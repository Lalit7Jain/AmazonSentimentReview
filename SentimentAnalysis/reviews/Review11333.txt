There are occasionally a few glitches, but Alexa and I are learning together.  I got this for a birthday present and at first I thought it was a bit indulgent, but now I am in love with the Echo.  I use this in my art studio when I'm working. It is definitely great to have voice commands when my hands are messy.  I have been exploring new music on Amazon Prime playlists and can always listen to my own music by pairing my phone with the Echo. I can tell her to pause, change a station, ask a question, all with my hands full.  Very convenient. I know it is all programmed, but it is definitely fun and useful.  I always say "good morning" and "Good night" to Alexa and she'll treat me to a fun factoid or wish me sweet dreams. And she tells "punny" jokes.  Having a blast.
