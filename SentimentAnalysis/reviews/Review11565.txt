I bought this Echo about a year ago now and use it fairly often.  When I first got it, it worked really good controlling my smart home devices through my Wink Hub.  Over time however and more recently it started loosing is ability to respond to the Alexa wake up word.  There are times when nothing else is making noise in the house and I wind up Yelling at the Echo to get its attention from 3 feet away.  I called tech support and their only solution was to say that it may be fixed in a later update. .So far however the issue has not been addressed.  I did a google searh for the problem and I'm not the only one this has happened to.. I've changed it's location 3 times to no avail.  Not sure what do do here.
