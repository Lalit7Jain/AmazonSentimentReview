We have an open floor plan in our house and the Echo is centrally located in the kitchen. Previously when I wanted to listen to music I would get out my phone, connect it either a cable or bluetooth to a very large stereo system located in the living room. Then I would look through my amazon music and select the music I wanted to hear. Then either one of the other three members of my home would inform me that the volume of my music was intolerable and I would once again be reminded of my place in the house.
