I'm not very tech savvy, so I had a hard time connecting to music.  I did not realize I had to have a spotify or similar account to play music.  I thought I could just tell it to play any song, and it would.  Now I have a spotify account that I must pay monthly for if I want to listen to music. I still like the Echo and would recommend it!!
