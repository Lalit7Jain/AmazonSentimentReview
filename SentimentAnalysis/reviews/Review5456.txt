I really wanted to love the Amazon Echo.  I bought one for our family room/kitchen area after buying a Dot for my son for Christmas.  We both listen to music on Spotify and I didn't realize that only one device can stream Spotify at the same time.  If he was listening on his Dot in his bedroom, I couldn't listen in the Kitchen on the Echo or vice versa.  I thought I could solve this by registering each device to a different Amazon account.  Kids can't have their own Amazon account so I registered his Dot to my Amazon account and the shared family Echo to my husband's.  Unfortunately this still didn't work as our Spotify premium account is a family plan and you cannot stream music from more than one Amazon device at the same time.  Accessing Spotify was the biggest use of the Echo in the family space, so without that feature, it's not worth it.  (I realize there is Amazon Music, but we enjoy Spotify's functionality and broader music library.) My son loves his Dot and uses it not only for music, but alarms and asking it questions.  It's been a great purchase for him at a great price.  As for the Echo, I realized that we're better off with a good blue tooth speaker in our shared family space.
