My only gripe is with the integration experience.  There are a ton to choose from, but they vary greatly in quality of set up.  I've had some that were really easy to set up, some where the translation from the native app just wasn't there.  I expect this is more on the 3rd parties than on Amazon.  Anyway, over 1 year of use in the bank, and fully expect to keep using Echo for the foreseeable future!
