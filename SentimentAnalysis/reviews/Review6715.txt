We got one for Christmas and have already given it away because we are disappointed in the way it works.  They say it does not have additional costs but it is all about hooks into other fee based services.  Most of the basic questions we asked could not be answered by Alexa. We have a prime account but could not get Alexa to play any music we are interested in.  Very disappointed in the product.
