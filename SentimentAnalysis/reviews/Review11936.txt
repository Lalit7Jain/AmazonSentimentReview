I was unprepared how utterly useless alexa would be.  She cannot search by audio such as Shazam.  Songs that aren't in spotify she simply says "I cannot find that song in your library."  Many times alexa will just play something after not finding a song "you might like this song instead."  No!  I want you to do nothing instead alexa!  I was expecting a Siri like experience and alexa is anything but.  Design and quality are superior however the echo is really lacking in the software department.  The echo has been out well over a year and it seems more of a beta.  Come on amazon, the echo needs support!
