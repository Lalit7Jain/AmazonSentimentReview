I recenly discovered you can upload your digital music library to your Amazon account and your Echo will access that library, however the free limit is 250 tracks.  You can pay $25 a year for and upload up to 250,000 tracks!  That seems like a deal to me, but it also highlights the ultimate purpose of these devices; to sell the user content and services.  The device also streams on-line radio via TuneIn, but other .free and subscription-based streaming services are supported.  Additionally, if you query some information. say, the best vitamin for improved memory, the device will often direct you to a "product" on the Amazon sight, AND will order the item for you if you so desire.
