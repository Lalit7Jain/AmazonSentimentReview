Great! and keeps on getting better.  With more companies joining for home integration and added features Alexa works great adding her into your daily routine.  She is still learning, but nothing like her is out there or works nearly as good so she deserves 5 stars.  Will have the occasional glitch moment, or maybe she can't help you with a question, but the Alexa app clearly has thought about this and you can easily send feedback to Amazon to hopefully add this feature.
