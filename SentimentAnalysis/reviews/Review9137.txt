Fun, entertaining & convenient. Listens to anyone who calls her name, great range. I love being able to just ask for music, information, jokes and reminders on my shopping list. I know I'm not using the Echo to her greatest potential because I'm not so tech savvy, that's why this is a great product for ANYONE. Well made.
