Bought several Echo's as gifts for family members.  Everyone has raved about the ease of use to listen to music throughout the house and the convenience of Alexa - your personal attache'.  :-))  I have now linked electrical outlets and thermostats with Alexa and the results are outstanding.  Good job Amazon - keep expanding the capabilities.
