I have had numerous problems.  I returned and they supposedly repaired but it still doesn't work. No phone number to get help or return.  TOTALLY UNSATISFIED.  ....After much trouble they are finally going to replace the Echo.  Hoping the new one works better than the one I had.  I'll upgrade the stars when I am satisfied.
