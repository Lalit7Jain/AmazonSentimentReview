So... why only four stars? The range of knowledge to which Alexa has access is surprisingly (and sometimes annoyingly) limited. Yes, she can convert currency, metric equivalents, tell you news, weather, etc. But just today, a friend wanted to test her and asked, "Who wrote The Great Gatsby?" Many, many people know the answer to that as it's a literary classic." Alexa could not come up with F. Scott Fitzgerald and instead of admitting she didn't know, she said "The History of Things to Come, the dark horizon trilogy by Duncan Simpsin." Say what??? Each of us asked again, same response. So that's a baffling one. In fact, there are quite a few questions Alexa cannot answer or answers vaguely.
