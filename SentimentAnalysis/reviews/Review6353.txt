Main issue I have is no matter how far down I turn the volume knob it only takes the volume down to about half way, if I want any lower I have to issue voice commands. Getting it to execute the right command has improved over time although amount of times it wakes up falsely has increased. Overall really cool though, have it hooked up to an AnyMote Home device which allows me to control infrared remote devices like TVs etc.
