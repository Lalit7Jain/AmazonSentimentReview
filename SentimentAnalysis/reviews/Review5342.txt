1. Lack of equalizer (bass/mid/treble are all absent):  This is not acceptable, considering the price of full Echo speaker, and the fact that it had 2 years to mature as a product.  If you look at products like Vizio Crave 360, while it may not be a "smart" device, it does have very nice thumping sound for being a cylinder speaker.  I would imagine this equalizer function can be added with a software update.
