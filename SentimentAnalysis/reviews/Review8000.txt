If you're cooking, and need a timer set, just say "Alexa, set a timer for XX minutes".  You'll get an alert as soon as the time is up. If you want to know how much time is left, just ask Echo and she'll tell you "There's X minutes and X seconds left on your timer".  If you run low on an ingredient,  just tell Alexa to add the item to your shopping list. If your account is setup for it, you can even have the Echo order what you need, directly from amazon.
