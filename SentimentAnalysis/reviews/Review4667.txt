Amazon lies this thing doesnt learn or evolve or adapt to your repeated uses.  Had it over a year and it hasnt learned anytw and cant identify all the music I own when I request it to be played.  I just put it in a drawer.  Friggin waste.  Great bluetooth speaker.  Otherwise this thing can drop dead.
