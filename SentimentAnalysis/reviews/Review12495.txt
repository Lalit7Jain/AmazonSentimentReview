Alexa has become my to go to assistant for questions when I am working from home, it is better than Siri because the setting where Siri is alway on is not reliable. Alexa is different than Siri because it has answered questions that Siri cannot answer it is a different concept. I use Alexa to track everything from my workouts with Fitbit to my shopping lists. Alexa reads my Amazon books and Audio books. It can do so many things aside from kissing you in the morning.  I am happy I made the decision to buy Alexa.
