I thought my kindle paper white was the best "gadget" I ever bought until I got "Alexa" Echo. I have been able to listen to music that most people weren't lucky enough to know...Jack Jones, Shirley Bassey, Jerry Vale, etc...etc. It's the perfect gift for parents and grandparents (me). So easy, just set to WiFi and listen. LOVE LOVE LOVE it.
