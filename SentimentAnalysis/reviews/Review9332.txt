I love my Echo.  It's not perfect, but most of the time it knows what you are asking and responds with valuable information.  I gave it 4 stars because there is definitely still room for improvement.  The nice thing is that Amazon and other developers are constantly adding new skills to make it even better.  I can't wait to see what's next for Echo!
