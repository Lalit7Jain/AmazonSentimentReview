It's great if all you want to do is play music or control another smart device, but God help you if you have to ask it a question.  Alexa has to be the stupidest smart device I've used.  Alexa can't seem to handle simple questions about sports results, current events and trending topics.  It is frustratingly bad.  I have used Cortana, Siri and Okay Google on several devices, and all of them perform far better on searches.  Alexa is just not intuitive. I hope they can fix this issue.  The product looks nice and performs well in other areas, but for searches and answering questions, it is a complete fail.
