Had considerable difficulty linking to an I Phone.  Instructions could have been more complete. Had a friend who had one in operation who helped and connection was made.  Once in service, it has been amazing, almost unreal.  Robust sound, very intuitive.  Hope to add features such as light controls, etc.  Great gift for my bride.
