I haven't even had my echo for a year. It stopped working. I contacted Amazon and they basically told me that I have to keep calling back to resolve my issue. Apparently there is a different cord in which, they are all out of (for the past 2 months). Customer service is no help whatsoever. The product itself has potential but keep in mind, it stopped working for NO reason at all. Don't waste your money on a nonreliable, expensive product.
