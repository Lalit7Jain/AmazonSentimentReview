Great Smart addition to the household! After setup and learning, Echo frees you from the keyboard in many situations where verbal interaction is more than sufficient for information and instruction.  The speaker is much better than I thought it would be. With Amazon Prime and the music subscription, how great is it to have a song or artist in mind and merely query the name!  I will experiment further with household appliances and security system.
