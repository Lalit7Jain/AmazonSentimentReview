Alexa is an extremely well designed piece of hardware, as is the Dot for that matter. Alexa's speaker produces excellent sound for a device of such small size. The range of music available with Prime, if not comprehensive, is still very broad, and one has the option of uploading music to the cloud to fill in the gaps. Try asking "play some baroque music" and she [a female pronoun sounds better than "it" somehow] will give her stock 'can't help you with that" reply. Fortunately, Alexa can continue to evolve without having to replace the hardware (as Amazon and 3rd party app designers keep improving the back end), which is a nice change from the usual technology path where one's phones and laptops are 'over the hill' in a year or so.
