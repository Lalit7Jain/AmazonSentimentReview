I was very dismayed by the quality of product and lack of competence in the packaging.  Number one, the Echo did not work upon arrival and Number two, the power supply provided was simply the wrong unit.  After struggling several hours to get it operational (I was lucky enough to have an alternate power supply that worked) I finally gave up and called Amazon for help.  After about an hour of phone time Amazon finally agreed that the Echo was non-operational and provided the means to return it.  The original Echo had taken 10 days to arrive and the replacement took an additional 5 days, as it was to be a gift, the lengthy delay was quite inconvenient. When the replacement did come, it appeared to be new and unused and worked instantly right out of the box.  Bottom line, I felt a bit jerked around by the shoddy packaging, malfunction and long delay from purchase to usefulness but the fact the I got a new unit the performs flawlessly for the cost of a refurb solved the wounds a bit.
