My wife and I are having far too much fun in asking Alexa to "do" things. Currently we are asking her to play music -- String Quartets/GlennMiller/60's Rock/.... A great selection. Plus, we have uploaded a number of our favorites recorded many years ago... Plus, it is great to ask Alexa to set a timer -- "Alexa, set a timer for 10 minutes from now."  We are old enough to not remember that something needs to be accomplished in 10 minutes from now (;>). Several of our friends, after interacting with our Alexa, have bought both Echo and Dots. They too, are having far too much fun with a smart player. Thanks Amazon!
