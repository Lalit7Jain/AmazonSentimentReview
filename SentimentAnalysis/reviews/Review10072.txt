It's just a OK device and don't get fooled by all the hypes.  The search is very awkward and too limited.  In order to find any meaningful result, you have to say wikipedia +"question". When search a song, it also just pulls up from Amazon.  I will give Google Home a try and heard that the search is far better and natural.
