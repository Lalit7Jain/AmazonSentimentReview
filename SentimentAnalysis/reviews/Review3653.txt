I have two Echo Dots and I am very happy with them. But wanted the better Audio without having to hook up speakers to them so I got my self the Echo and the audio is great with it and now I have one Echo in my Bedroom and got another for the living room. I put the two Dots into the kitchen and second bedroom.
