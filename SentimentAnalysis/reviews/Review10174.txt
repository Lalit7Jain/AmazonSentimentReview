Echo has cool sound and I love having it all the way up in my apartment during the day. Shakes the ground so keep it at volume 6 or less for nightime use out of respect for apartment peeps. 7 or higher when you're home alone or during the day, no one will mind as much. Great for music lovers who like to dance to a heavy beat or sing along loudly!!
