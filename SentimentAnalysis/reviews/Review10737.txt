I am stiil a neophite regarding the Echos' capbilities, particularly what database it uses for specific music selections.  In some cases the Echo does not have access to the entire, track, album, or artist library, but will play "samples".  When it does access a complete song, it often selects a rendition that I am unfamiliar with; song by other than the original artist, or a live version.  I find this characteristic refreshing as I enjoy discovering "new, old stock".
