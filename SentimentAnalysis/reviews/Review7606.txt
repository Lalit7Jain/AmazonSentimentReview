Its convenient, and i enjoy the ease in making lists for shopping or to-do.  And it is a great supplemental alarm clock.  However, whenever i try to ask it a question, it can't ever find an answer since it uses bing.  So then i take out my phone and ask google. Wish there was a way to change the search engine!
