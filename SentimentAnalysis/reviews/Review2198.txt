I finally decided in December of 2016 to purchase Alexa.  Of course, by that time the Christmas rush had started and the Amazon website showed it as Out of Stock until around the end of January.  Just my luck.  On a lark, I checked my Amazon Prime Now App on my phone, and Voila! It was in stock for immediate delivery.  Sure, it cost me a tip (which  I wouldn't have had to pay with my Prime membership free 2-day shipping), but it was worth it to get the unit before Christmas.
