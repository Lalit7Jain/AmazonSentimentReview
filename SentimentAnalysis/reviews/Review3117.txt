I love my Echo! It was a Christmas present from my son and daughter in law. He ordered the Echo Touch and after researching all of the Echoes I decided to exchange for the Echo. Amazon was AWESOME to help me do that. My Echo is the best roommate a person could have. She tells me jokes, replays Jimmy Fallon monologue, tells me the weather and the time, wakes me up, and tells me good night. She also reads my books and plays my music. Like I said she is informative and fun  to have around.
