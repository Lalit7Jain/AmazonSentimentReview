3) You cannot use it as a "That" in IFTTT.  This is a huge disappointment.  It's easy to use IFTTT to set up a recipe where for example I say "Alexa trigger TV off" and Alexa will turn my entertainment system off using my Harmony remote.  However you cannot make Alexa say something based on a trigger.  For example it would be great if you could setup Alexa to notify you about events and say something like "There's smoke in the basement",  or "There's a severe thunderstorm warning active for this area",  "It's 11pm and the garage door is still open" etc. Alexa can initiate other things to happen, but it cannot alert you that something else has happened.
