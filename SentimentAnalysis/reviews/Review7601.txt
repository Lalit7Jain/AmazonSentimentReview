Love the concept. Unfortunately it only responds to voice commands about 50% of the time. This can be quite annoying, my German Shepherd is much more responsive at about 98%, (he occasionally cops an attitude as he's spoiled rotten ). There are limited, "skills" that Alexa is supposed to perform,  however many of these don't work well, if at all. I have factory reset it and given it voice training,  twice. I bought my wife an Echo Dot, in the misguided,  thus far hope it would have better voice capabilities as it's the 2nd gen. I unfortunately can't get it to even register. Let me say also that I'm quite nowlegable about tech, I build my own computers and have lots of electronics experience.  Thus far I would say wait and see if it gets better. I also am told that Amazon will be releasing an Echo with a tablet on board in the first quarter of 2017. I guess then if she won't listen that you can....type instructions in!
