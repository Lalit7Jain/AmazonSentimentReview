It's a neat device but after owning it for some time now, still have no idea what to use it for.  It plays music pretty well, and I guess you can ask it some basic questions about the weather and what movies are playing.  A very expensive gadget, hopefully they will be able to integrate it better with Google apps in the future or give it some wider purpose for existing.
