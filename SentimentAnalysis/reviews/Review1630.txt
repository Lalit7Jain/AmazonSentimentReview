I love my Echo. So far, I have only used it for grocery list, calendar and music. I look forward to later adding light switches and sockets so I can turn my lights on and off with voice commands. I also enjoy the news and weather, as well as having many answers available at my fingertips. I have suggested this for a friend who is blind, as I can see where it would be a wonderful asset to her.
