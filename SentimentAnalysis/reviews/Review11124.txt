Yes, you need to learn sometimes how to ask Alexa things in specific ways, such as "Alexa, play the song ______ by _____ on Spotify", and not just "Alexa, play (insert song name here)" and expect her to use Spotify or pandora. BUT, I would say this is needed when using any voice controlled technology and you get used to it very quickly.
