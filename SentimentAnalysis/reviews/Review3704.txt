Got this product in November around Thanksgiving.  In January, I am returning it.  Initially it worked fine.  Then towards the end of January, the Echo would come on by itself - no noise, nothing was around it.  It would have the ring as if it were processing something but never did anything.  Then it would just say random stuff without any prompts.  It was rather creepy.  I had to, unfortunately, return the one thing I truly wanted for xmas.  Oh well.  May still get it again, once the bugs get worked out.
