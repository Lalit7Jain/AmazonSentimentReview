I purchased it as a gift for my parents. They are none of the aforementioned and they are only interested in technology if they do not have to learn something new and they can see it make their life simpler. ... So that pretty much rules out most any form of new technology, unfortunately. But I figured that all they have to do is talk to it. "No buttons, mom!" "And you can say this..." "And it will reply, ....that..."
