I hear Alexa at my sister's and fell in love. I got a great deal when Amazon had the special sale for Prime users and I love how Alexa brings music and life into my flat. She reminds me when Arsenal are playing; and yes this is important for a good life. She connects with Spotify which makes listening too music a dream. If you like a wide variety of music, the music on Amazon is a bit limited. So with Spotify, I get to listen to French, Moroccan, Indian, Arabic, Italian and other music. The sound is crystal clear and her voice is well modulated. She does need to be able to select better music. It will come. I haven't used her to purchase stuff, but now I will. Christmas is here :-)
