While I initially enjoyed this product, and still use it often, it has started making this odd crackling static stutter noise periodically while I listen to music. It occurs in bursts of 2 seconds or so and every 10-15 seconds. Very annoying, and has completely ruined any music play on the device. The device is no longer eligible for replacement, so it looks like I am out of luck and stuck with a defective product.
