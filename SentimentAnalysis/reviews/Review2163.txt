Really disappointed that Amazon, through this device  forces users into a narrow choice of music platforms (their own and other paid subscriptions rather than allowing you to use your own established music library (such as itunes). Sure, you can tether your music device to the echo through Bluetooth,  but in this case voice commands are limited.  Additionally, the echo's intelligence is fledgling at this time and had definitely not reached its full potential (it cannot answer surprisingly easy questions). Hopefully this will improve over time as Alexa's intelligence resides in the cloud and therefore can evolve and build over time. The best feature is the "computer" wake name which allows star trek geeks to live out their star trek fantasies.  Guilty as charged.
