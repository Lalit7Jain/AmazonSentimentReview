Has very limited functionality. Good for streaming music. Terrible for streaming news as there is a limited selection of sources, Cannot synch with a Microsoft calendar is outlook, so calendar function is limited to Google. Ability to answer simple questions such as At what level did the Dow Jones Index close today, is not understood. Only reason I am keeping it is in the hope that over time it will get better.
