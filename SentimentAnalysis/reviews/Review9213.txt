Love this thing.  Mostly use it for music (amazon prime) timers and as a white noise maker at night.  Very easy to use.  I would like to do more like listen to podcasts and other streaming services which I think you can do.  I would like not have to hunt around websites to find out how to do more stuff with it.  Why can't amazon have a single place that teaches you how to do stuff in a step by step manner.  Like loop a song or stream a website etc....
