Great idea unless you are living in a dorm this will not work! Not compatable with their wifi, worked great at home, useless in the dorm. Bought this for my son last Christmas thought it would be perfect for his dorm room!  Much to both of our surprise it doesn't work at all! We asked around and that's what we were told won't even work with Ethernet cable!  Had to bring it home now he only gets to use it when he's on break! So 9 months out of the year it's unusable! Real shame that Amazon hasn't addressed  the problem I've read other parents with the same complaint. I would have given it a better rating but since it's unusable for what it was intended have to give it a disappointing 2 stars.
