This thing is insanely cool. I bought it for my parents for Christmas. My dad loves it and my mom wants to kill me. He keeps requesting a song just to see if it can find it. She says he is worse with the Echo than he is changing channels on the TV. I also got a wall outlet and wall switch to go with it. The outlet works great with a lamp. They haven't installed the wall switch yet.
