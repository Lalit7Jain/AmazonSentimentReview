An amazing concept. When it works it is the best thing going in home automation. When it doesn't it's not even a decent paperweight. The setup for controlling devices in your home is VERY clunky. Each time you want to add a new device you have to start over from scratch, which shouldn't be the case. Hopefully this will be fixed!
