It was my husband's birthday present. He loves it. Our family of three habit placed in our living room to get the most use out of our Amazon echo. We three use it primarily for weather forecasts, Christmas music, shopping lists, and enabled games that my husband asked me to use via Amazon echo's Skill set. Jeopardy, 21 questions, animal game, guess that number are our favorite. The echo is capable of much more, but she's my husband's and he will make use of her abilities as time goes by.
