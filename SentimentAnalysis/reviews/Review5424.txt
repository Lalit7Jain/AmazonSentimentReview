Ive had this Echo for weeks now and I cannot use it.I download the apps after I bought a new Apple i Phone for $600 and it still wont work,bought mini Apple i pad,thought that would work better,NO,now I just ordered Amazon Prime because I heard with that it will work better?? I have wifi but live in the Mountains and not sure because I have only one or two bars in the house if I now need a booster to make my Echo work.? I have another couple of weeks that I can return this Echo and I am thinking of doing just that.Any help or ideas would be greatly appreciated .
