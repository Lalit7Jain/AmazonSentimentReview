I just bought it on a wim and started using it for alarms, timers and music.  "alexa play 105.3 fm"  "Alexa play Ride by 21 Pilots"  "Alexa volume 6"  "alexa wake me up at 7:42 am"  However, after a bit I bought some Philips hue light bulbs and a tp Link smart switch and Now I can say, "alexa, put the bedroom at 48%" and then the lights go to 48%.  Or I'll say, "Alexa, put the living room at 65%" and the lamps will go to 65%.  "Alexa turn off the window lamp"  "alexa, turn on the heater"
