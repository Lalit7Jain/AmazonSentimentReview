What a neat device ... just installed it and added a smart receptacle to control lights just to test the product.  After some trial and error got the lights controlled along with music, jokes, stupid questions, how much wood could a ..., etc.  I'm sure many new things and functions will be added as time goes on.  Price changes on this device from time to time so keep watching and grab it when the price changes.  Have fun!
