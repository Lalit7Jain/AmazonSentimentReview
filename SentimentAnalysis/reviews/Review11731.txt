I wish I would have purchased this when they first came out and prime members could get them for $99. For whatever reason, I didn't think it was going to take off like it did. Just got one and it is AWESOME. We use all apple products in our house so I wish it could link to my iPhone calendars but even without this function, it offers so much it is worth it.
