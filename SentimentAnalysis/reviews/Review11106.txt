I bought the Amazon Echo in July when it ran on a special lightning deal.  I thought if I liked it I could purchase some for friends.  When I received it I sat it aside still in its box, and almost forgot about it.  I opened the box about a week ago.  It was very easy to set up and in a very few minutes I was listening to music.  I really do like it.  When my granddaughter saw and heard it she expressed a desire for one also.  I really hope Amazon puts them on sale for Christmas as I do plan on purchasing more.
