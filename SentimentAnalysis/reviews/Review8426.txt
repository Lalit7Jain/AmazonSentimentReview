There's a lot of potential in this gadget.  The looks are awesome and it fits the style of most every room in the house.  The enclosed speakers ar pretty good quality considering their size.  I have notice that Alexa doesn't always recognize her name, especially with a lot of ambient noise.  I have yet to try the home automation and can't advise which system is the best for that.
