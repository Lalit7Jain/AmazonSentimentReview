I got this as a gift from a friend for my birthday and honestly I can say it may be the best gift EVER!  I would have never gotten it for myself, now I am browsing all the possible accessories.... Who knew I need it so badly?  Love the phone answering capabilities, ordering something from amazon, reading a book, playing music, finding recipes and adding to my grocery list!  I am just figuring out all it can do.  Kids fight over who gets to select music... don't forget to ask her to tell a joke.... The sound quality is amazing!  Amazon prime music is awesome!
