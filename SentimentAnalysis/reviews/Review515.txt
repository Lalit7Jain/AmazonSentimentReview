The way Amazon has set up the ecosystem, third party providers such as Spotify contract with Amazon to provide plugins. Then, when you want to use the Spotify plugin, you have to give it the right keyword to invoke that plugin, followed by the correct syntax that the Spotify plugin understands.  If you do not do both of those things correctly, your request will fail.  So, for instance, if you are a Spotify customer, you could say "Alexa, play the playlist Blah from Spotify",  and that would work, but "Alexa, play the playlist Blah" would not work, nor would "Alexa play Blah from Spotify", or "Alexa play Blah".
