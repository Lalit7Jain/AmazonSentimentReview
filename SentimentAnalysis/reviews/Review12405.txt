I was an early adopter and ordered the Echo before it had even been released.  I was very happy with it until this last month.  It stopped hooking into my wifi network.  I worked with technical support and on it myself for about 4 hours.  Nothing worked.  So I asked for a replacement.  I was told I am out of warranty and would have to pay $150 for a new one.  Since I was an early adopter I had only paid $99 originally so customer support will ONLY charge me $99 for a refurbished replacement.  By the way, I have a Tap and it hooks into my network with no problems.
