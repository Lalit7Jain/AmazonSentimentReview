I really like it but still getting used to all the things you can do.  It is a little cumbersome trying to remember the correct phrases for the skills and music. If you don't word it exactly right, it doesn't work but that should resolve itself as I use it more.  Not liking the privacy issues but try to remember to use the mute button whenever we are not using it.  We love the fact that you can say Alexa play my playlist with Amazon prime.  The speakers sound great!
