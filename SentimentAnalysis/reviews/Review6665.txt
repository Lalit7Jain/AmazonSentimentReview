Its been a year now of using Alexa, we LOVE her in our house, use her for music, timers, jokes, weather, cooking converstions and so on to other many things, shes very handy, convenient  and amussing, actually very amusing. Altho there are times we ask her things and she doesnt know them, for some reason she only can tell some of college football, she doesnt our team which is weird since its VT, so i think they need to work out some things with her and work out those things but Alexa is amazing all around
