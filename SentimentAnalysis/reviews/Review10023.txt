OK, keeping this brief, because I love my Echo, though I've not explored it's abilities as much as I should be.  As I am about to buy a Tap and a Dot, I wanted to make Amazon aware of the following review, in hopes that they will investigate work to resolve the claims made in the article below...I finished it feeling as though the gentleman was paid by Google, but I also know some of his claims are valid...I hope Amazon is able to move the next step forward to continue improving a great product.
