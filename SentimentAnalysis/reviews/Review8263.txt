So far it has been a mixed bag.  Mostly positive, but it has trouble understanding commands sometimes.  Also, the much vaunted ability to identify commands in a noisy environment is a bit overstated.  Get it playing music loudly and you will not get it to respond to other command without physically approaching it closely.  Does seem to work well with smart home setups, if a tad bit slow.  I have successfully hooked up Insteon switches (through a hub) and a Honeywell Total Comfort thermostat to the Echo.
