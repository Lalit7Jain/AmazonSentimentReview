The echo is one of the biggest disappointments I've ever had in electronics, a total waste of money too. Alexa can't figure out where Jfk international airport is. It will not do any traffic for me. The shopping list option sucks. I can't delete things off it, and have to say "Alexa put this on my shopping list" for every single item. It won't tell me the weather in the town I live in. Yes, I do have the app, and yes I tried to personalize it. My kids don't even like the Echo. I can't wait to return it. If you've ever used Google, the Echo will drive you crazy.
