Before you buy the Echo have a clear idea of what it can do and how you can use it.  (I'd also recommend the remote if you decide it's for you).  I thought we would get a lot of use out of this and hope that as time goes on, additions and improvements made, we will find more uses.  The "Skills" available do not get very good ratings.  The speaker quality is just okay for music.  We don't use it for news or sports either so basically it's used for time, a timer, occasionally weather, shopping list (this is the best) and to to list.  I have to say we find we might go a week without using it.  Again, have a clear idea what you want to use it for and make sure it can do what you want.
