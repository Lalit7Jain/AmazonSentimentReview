I've wanted an echo for quite some time but could not get myself to spend the $180 on it. I saw a refurbished one on here for $150 and decided to give it a shot and boy am I glad I did. The echo came the complete opposite as I expected. It came with the original box, original paper work and original everything. The opening experience was great and the product came in such a high quality box there was absolutely nothing to complain about. Would recommend you save the $30 and buy the refurbished one because it's literally the exact same thing.
