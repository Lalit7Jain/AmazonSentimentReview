Super cool gadget to have at home. I mostly listen to music with it (and it easily fills up a living room) - But also like the morning briefing. It connects to other apps like Pandora, TuneIn Radio, etc. I ask Alexa for the time, weather, sports scores, and an occasional pick up line. Also great  to use as a timer when you are cooking. There are many other "skills" like "Call me an Uber" and they are getting better by the day. I like having Alexa around and would highly recommend.
