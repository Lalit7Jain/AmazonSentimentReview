Really cool and fun product. I have yet to take full advantage of integrating into a "smart home" type environment, which was/is the intent of the purchase.  I have no reason to think that won't work well, as "Alexa" does a very good job picking up on voices from a fairly good distance and doesn't seem to have trouble will different people's cadence or accents.  While I haven't used the Google Home, I would probably expect it to have more "answers" than Alexa, as Alexa seems to struggle with some basic questions.  But most people are going to use to get whether, get news, turn out lights, set alarms and timers, etc, all of which work very well. I like the "skills" (these are akin to "applications" for a mobile phone) which give additional capabilities, such as looking up recipes, etc.
