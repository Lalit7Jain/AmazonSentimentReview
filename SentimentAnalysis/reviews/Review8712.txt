I have become addicted to Alexa. We use her every single day. She tells us the weather for the day, makes my shopping lists, keeps time for my kids' timed reading homework, orders my pizza, tells me who that actor is in that episode of the show that I am watching, and most importantly, she plays me music. So much music. Good sound, by the way. And she has great range. We have a large, open-concept house. We put Alexa as close as we could to the center, and she can hear us call to her from the entire downstairs and part of the upstairs. Impressive. We're currently shopping for Alexa-enabled light and power switches. I suspect this is as close as I'm going to get to having the computer from the starship Enterprise.
