We are still learning how to get the most from our echo.  I've found that it's the way you ask for certain music.  For example, "play the beatles" will get a response directing me to subscribe for music but if I say, "play top hits by the beatles" I get exactly what I'm looking for.  We have fun asking "are you having a good day?, etc."  I like that I can request fun music or dinner music.  I've recently added a smart bulb to the house and the echo controls that as well.  This is fun technology.  There is a learning curve so you have to give it time plus read the email updates you receive teaches new tips/skills.
