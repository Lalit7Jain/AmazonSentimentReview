I got the Echo for my Dad, we hooked it up yesterday and started talking to Alexa. Asking her basic questions and just testing her a bit and found she can't answer some really basic questions. I told my Dad that hopefully Amazon will come out with some updates to improve her IQ. He wanted her mostly for answering questions and news. He's not very impressed.
