So far I love my Echo. It pairs nicely with my TP-Link light bulbs and has a decent speaker for listening to Pandora. I especially love all of the different skills; from adventure games, to jokes, to pick-up lines. The only thing I could do without is the need to repeat myself much of the time. If I wanted to repeat myself I would have a husband and kids....
