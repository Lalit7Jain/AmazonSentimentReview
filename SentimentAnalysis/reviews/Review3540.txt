I would actually give it 4.5 stars, simply because I cannot change the name to SkyNet.  But she tells me the weather, news, how many teaspoons in a table spoon, creates my shopping list, and plays music.  The sound quality is really nice.  Will consider upgrading review to 5 stars with the addition of "SkyNet" as a possible name.
