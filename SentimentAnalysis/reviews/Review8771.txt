I purchased the Amazon Echo as a gift for my elderly parents (ages 86 and 90).  It had become difficult for them to use their stereo and the Amazon Echo brings them so much enjoyment every day.  They listen to the news, and music from their childhood to current music, they sing along, they dance, it's just wonderful!  The perfect gift!
