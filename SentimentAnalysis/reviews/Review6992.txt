Just got a Echo for Christmas.  After experimenting with it for an hour, I realized its really just an advanced Bluetooth speaker.  It can't answer questions like Siri.  I have Spotify Premium and the sound from Echo is not bad so decided to keep it.  I had a lot of trouble with setup.  It wants to use Amazon Prime for everything, including music.  You need to explicitly tell it not to. Its more of a sales portal for Amazon. I'd never buy it myself but as a gift its okay.
