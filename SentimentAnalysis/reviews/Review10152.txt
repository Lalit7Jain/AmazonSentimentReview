I wish Alexa had a little bit more AI and be more conversational.  The skills are great but I sometimes forget the "catch phrase".  I also hope there are more settings for traffic report for work.  I use non toll roads and Alexa only gives me fastest route.  Otherwise, I find Alexa to be an eye opener to making my home smart.
