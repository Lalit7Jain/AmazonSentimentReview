This is so cool it sounds great works well.  All I can say is it is just what they say it is.the only fall back would be is what ever you say for it to do is typed out on your Alexa account from word to word. But it does not matter because I love it and you just don't say anything you don't want typed out. Just ask for her to do what she is meant to do
