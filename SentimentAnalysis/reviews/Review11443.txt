I bought my first echo at Home Depot during Black Friday last year; I did not know what it was and I knew I could return it.  However, since owing my echo I have bought a second one during the Prime sale on Amazon for down stairs.  Needless to say, I love my echo's.  I listen to my audible books, music and connect to my devices for Bluetooth use.  I do like the weather feature especially when I am traveling away from home and want to know how to pack.  I am strongly considering buying another one.  I am really please with the product.
