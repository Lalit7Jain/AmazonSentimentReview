Alexa and I have a love/hate relationship.  Often, when I ask her a question, she says she doesn't know the answer.  I have tried re-phrasing the question and she still doesn't know.  I am not asking what I consider difficult questions.  Frustrating. I do enjoy my music, so she makes a good little speaker.
