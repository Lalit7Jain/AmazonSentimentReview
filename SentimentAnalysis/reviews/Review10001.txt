The Echo is awesome. I cant wait to get connected devices light lights, thermostats, etc.... this thing is great. We use it all the time and have a lot of fun with it. Its actually quite surprising how well it does in taking commands and answering questions you would not expect it could ! I understand I can even have Alexa start my car now (note I don't think all manufacturers support yet) !
