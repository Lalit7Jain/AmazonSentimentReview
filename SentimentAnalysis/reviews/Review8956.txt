Answering questions, reading audio books, the news, weather, etc.:  Again it does these "skills," but because Echo isn't as intuitive as one is led to believe, some of them require teaching Echo the skill. For instance, it doesn't come able to give you traffic reports. From what I've been able to discern, the info given on the traffic report is only for the destination that's been programmed.  When I ask for a traffic report, it gives me the fastest route to New Rochelle, NY, which I programmed yesterday, and it's not a detailed report.  When I ask for a traffic report for Albany, NY, near where I live, it gives me the fastest route to New Rochelle, NY, again because that's what's programmed. I assumed, again my bad/ignorance, that Echo could/would give info such as "In Albany, traffic on Interstate 90 is heavy," or whatever.  Am I doing something wrong?
