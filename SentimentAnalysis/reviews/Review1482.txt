I do love my Echo. She sounds great and is a lot of fun. My mother would always comment on how much she liked it, but they don't have Amazon Prime (they won't do any shopping or banking online at all, they just refuse). Since they don't have Prime they wouldn't be able to use some of Alexa's features, so when the Google Home came out, I bought one of those so I could compare.
