I bought this in July so I'm a little late with my review, I love this device! I bought it originally to replace my outdated stereo & since I could place this anywhere it worked great outside when we have company but it could not be to far from the house otherwise the wifi would disconnect. The only downfall so far is I had to buy another one because I mistakenly put it in the room with my bird to entertain her while I'm not home (Congo African Grey) and she is now loving it, she can turn it on, play music, skip a song & turn the volume up all without my help so if I don't disable it at night I wake up to music playing at 5am lol. So if my bird can run this device anyone can is the morale of my story. Enjoy it nothing is perfect so don't pic it apart unless you get a faulty one & they refuse to replace it.
