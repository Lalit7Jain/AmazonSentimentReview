I absolutely love this!!! My only request is that you PLEASE make this with a chargeable battery!!!! With everything being cordless these days, it's really strange having to always have this plugged in. It would be really nice to just pick it up and move it wherever in the house not having to worry about the plug. Even a 8-12 hour battery would be wonderful. I would buy several more if it didn't always have to be plugged in.
