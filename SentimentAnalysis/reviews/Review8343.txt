We have ready been enjoying Alexa!  She is so much fun!  We love being able to play music and change the volume or station with just our voice ( that hands free feature helps when you're busy with renovation projects!), but my kids also love hearing her jokes and playing games with Alexa like the Animal Game ( where they think of an animal and Alexa tries to guess what it is), Rock/Paper/Scissors, Word Master, and Insultabot.
