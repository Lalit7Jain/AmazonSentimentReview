I'm looking forward to adding compatible technology, but so far the entire family is enjoying "Alexa," even with a few minor "hiccups" every now and then.  I AM disappointed that only two months after I purchased this Amazon has released a new "Dot," which works exactly the same way as the more expensive Echo, but for only a fraction of the price.  If I had known then what I know now, I would've saved almost $100 and gone with the Dot, and my own speakers...
