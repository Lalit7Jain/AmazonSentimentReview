My echo is going haywire. It's turning on when I haven't even uttered its code name. It's been very frustrating to call out to the device and not get a response, I've even walked all the way up to it and have raised my voice several times, to no avail. This is happening too offend, I just can't figure out what's wrong. After watching some You Tube reviews, I have noted that other people are having a few issues with Alexa..... however, not to the extent that I am experiencing. I got a dot... so far it's doing what it's suppose to do..... I also have the echo tap..... just got it..... so far I would have to say that it doesn't always get the requested music right, therefore I acquiesce to what ever or I try again.... and, again.... or I'll just change my tune.
