I bought the Amazon Echo as a novelty thing. I had no idea how useful and entertaining this device would become. It has replaced my alarm clock, my radio, and my calendar just to name a few. It easily tied it into my home automation system and is now used it to control the thermostat and the lights in my home. It's Bluetooth pairs with my cell phone and PC computers to act as a speaker for those devices when I want. I love how easy it is to set appointments, reminders, and make task lists. I highly recommend it for anyone.
