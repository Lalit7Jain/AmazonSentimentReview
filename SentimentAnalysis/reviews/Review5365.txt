I brought this for my fiancé for Christmas and he loves it . We are listening to music on it all the time and it's great to know the weather forecast when I get up in the am. It seems to answer all questions easily and so far it's been a very nice addition to our home. To note it fits nicely on the entertainment system and looks like part of it which is esthetically pleasing ..
