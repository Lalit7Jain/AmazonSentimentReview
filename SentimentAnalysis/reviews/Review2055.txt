I love Alexa - however today I wasn't able to play any music, just kept telling me she was unable to play at this time.  Tried to call the help line and was put on hold for 20 minutes!?!?  I finally gave up and hung up.  I'm hoping to get answers soon.  Could be slow internet.  I live in the middle of no-where and have to rely on my ATT cell / mifi device for internet and its 1/2 *ss at best.  Yesterday everything was working fine.  The better internet connection you have the better off you'll be.  Otherwise I absolutely love this device!
