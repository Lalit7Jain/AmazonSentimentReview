So far soo Good! It was very easy to setup and love the music unlimited option for just 4 bucks a month to play basically anything you want. The speaker sounds great, I wasn't expecting to sound as good as it did and neither was my family on Christmas day. Everyone couldn't stop playing with it and saying how much they wanted one after seeing everything that it could do. I paired it up to my Nest as well as my Belkin Wemo switch. I was always thinking of changing my lights in my house to something like the HUE from phillips but only being able to do it from my phone and the cost made it a little bit of a stretch to do. I am now really thinking about purchasing them now with the Alexa due to how easy it is to control things in your house by just speaking to it.I have flood lights in my backyard that i can control easily from Alexa versus going through the app to turn them on. I was surprised how fast and easy it recognized what to turn on. I'm a techy guy so I love how it integrates in my house easily, and I can't wait to see what else gets integrated in the future!
