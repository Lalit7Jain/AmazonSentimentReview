Don't know how to give a negative star to Echo and Amazon.  Had since October 2016, went out of warranty in December, now won't work with router it's been on for last couple of months.  Tried all of the so called fixes, rebooted all connections, restored to factory, rebooted all connections, pressed for 5 seconds, then tried again to reconnect, finds modem then hangs until it times out.  Tried several time (probably 10 or more) to do all over again.  Still doesn't work.  Sucks to be me.  We have been using amazon for years, now I have to eat $195.  Guess I'll have to find another way to purchase online.
