The only downside I would say goes back to what i said before. Its good for what you use it for (music, recipes, games, weather, and a question or two). However other than that we forget that its even in the room and let it collect dust. Like i said its not like having a cool A.I from the future to talk to in the room. If im not asking it anything, and you will get bored with doing so or trying to come up with things, then it pretty much will just sit there and do nothing. It makes you wonder if you are just going to use it for music or a few questions, why not just play your stereo or look up the answer on your phone internet quickly.
