It was a Christmas gift that I was initially miffed with. We have every gadget known to mankind and didn't need another distraction. We got it home, opened the box and then {Cue theme song to The Jetsons} we had our own little piece of high end, highly usable technology. All I want to say is... you gotta try this.
