First of all, beware that you get a free trial for Amazon digital music with the purchase. If you don't cancel it within 30-days, you will be charged a monthly fee of $4.32. I never received the warning email about this, so it automatically appeared on my credit card and then I cancelled the subscription.  Also, be aware that this device is always listening. So if you are sensitive about hackers getting into to your WiFi, this is another vulnerability. It's kind of creepy if you think about it.  It's not yet compatible with the new Savant Remote, so I was misguided in buying this in the first place.  If it wasn't too late, I'd return it.  Once I got beyond the initial newness of it, it now just sits there unused for the most part.  So it's a waste of money in my household to be honest.
