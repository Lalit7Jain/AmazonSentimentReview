Awesome device. My son was having trouble wetting the bed because he was afraid of the dark. We bought him Alexa and set the lights from his room to the bathroom up so that she could control them. Now if he has to go to the bathroom at night he can turn all the lights on before getting out of bed. Go to the restroom and then turn them all back off again once he is back in bed. It has completely stopped his bed wetting. Kind of an unconventional use for it, but works like magic. My son and daughter enjoy asking Alexa jokes and questions. They recently announced that they will have full support of Sonos next year. You can get Amazon Music for $5 which is half of any other music streaming service. At it's base it is a nice little voice controlled speaker with a few gimmicks, and it is worth it's price just for that. However if you dig a little deeper it is the future of home automation. I have been hoping that they would do a music sync so I could play 1 song on multiple Echos at the same time completely synced, but now that they are supporting Sonos that is no longer a problem. I will shortly have several of echo's little siblings in my house. Alexa pairs really well with Smart Things by Samsung. Welcome to the future.
