Decided to try the Echo and now I'm hooked.  Works far better than I expected, and I now use it to control almost all my home automation- adjusting my Nest thermostat, and controlling my Lutron Casetta dimmer switches via my Wink hub.  Run 'robots' with it as well- I tell Alexa to turn on 'Good morning' and several sets of lights turn on at whatever dimmer setting I choose, and the TV and coffee pot turn on.
