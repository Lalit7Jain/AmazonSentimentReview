UPDATE: I bought this in November of last year, this is March 2017. I'm getting disgusted with Alexa. Since I'm not a prime member there is so much stuff I can't do with Alexa. We now switched to daylight savings time and Alexa says she can adjust for it but really can't. She tells me it will take place on March 12 at 2 AM. Next day still old time. This is a simple task why can't she do it, do I have to be a prime member for this too?
