Really enjoy this item and hear it for the kitchen to living room to computer room.  Good volume in depth for the price. A little tricky at first to get it to get used to your voice, and you have to say it right to get the music section scores for movies to be understood  and played.  Didn't buy the  Black dot and I don't think we need it
