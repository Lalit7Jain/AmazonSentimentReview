Got this for my family for Christmas. They absolutely love it. It will only get better with time as well if they buy more smart home devices like the Phillips Hue bulbs that I paired with this. You can ask it all kinds of questions and it usually knows the answer. Also it is an amazing for a bluetooth speaker. If you have Amazon Prime it is even better since you can pair it with Amazon's music service and play almost any song you want.
