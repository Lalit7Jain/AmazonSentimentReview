I really enjoy Alexa, especially for music. Amazon offers a great music deal for Alexa and I would highly recommend it. I can play whole albums, tracts, artists, genres and even mood music. I have found if I go to Amazon digital music, you can find almost any album you want Alexa to play. She seems to have a bit trouble with classical music, but it isn't a deal killer. Some of the skills are fantastic. If you are a fan of old radio, there are many programs, Supeman, Dragnet, Gunsmoke and even the suspense thrillers. I do agree with a lot of reviews that say Alexa is not as informative as Sari or Google, there are many things she cannot find. The calendar and weather integration is super. I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone.
