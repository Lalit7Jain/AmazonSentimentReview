I don't review anything, this deserves my first review. I hate this thing! If I could, I'd give it 0 stars. I sincerely regret buying it. It has become an unreliable gonna drop you anytime, might work once in a blue-moon speaker with just as horrible an app. I could deal with it before because I could connect Bluetooth to play reliable music apps but it won 't even connect anymore. And generic emails from customer service disgrace the customer. Bring back real customer service!
