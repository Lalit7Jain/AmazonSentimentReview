Love Echo, but you have to download too many apps to get the full use out of it.  Find myself using it for basic things like playing music, checking weather and simple things.  Had a hard time setting it up with my calendar and it doesn't work with Apple calendar, only Google calendar.  It's a toy, not a necessity.
