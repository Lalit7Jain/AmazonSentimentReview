I've been enjoying the Echo so much, I bought another, so I could have one in the family room and one in the man cave. Nice sound quality and max volume. Decent range for voice activation. I think it's an excellent mid-range sound device and you'll enjoy owning one too. (It's been on sale for 139.99 for the holidays)
