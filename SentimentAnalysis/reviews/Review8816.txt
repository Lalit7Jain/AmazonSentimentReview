Even Alexa believes in Santa Claus.  Just ask, my grandson did and was not disappointed.  We love our Alexa, she plays games, answers questions and turns out the lights.  She has a sense of humor and tells corny jokes that entertain us all.  I am amazed at all the skills she can learn.  I have recommended the Echo or the dot to everyone I know.
