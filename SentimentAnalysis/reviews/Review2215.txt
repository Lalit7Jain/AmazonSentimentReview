I love the device ,however the worst thing about it is every time one of the TV commercials comes on and it says the trigger word Alexa, the damn device comes on and ifI was stupid enough to set it up to order items through voice I would probably have 150,000 boxes of cereal and other items showing up at my doorstep! You can tell me this is not intentional! I love this scumbag corporation moneymaking tactics
