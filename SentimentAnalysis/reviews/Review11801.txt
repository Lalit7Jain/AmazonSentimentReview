We use her for the time and weather, of course, but we also have her connected to Spotify and Pandora, and we use that all the time. She's completely replaced my Bluetooth speakers. One of my favorite things to do when I'm away from home is to start up a song on Spotify from the app to surprise my partner. It's pretty funny when you're home alone and Alexa randomly starts playing music from someone 30 miles away.
