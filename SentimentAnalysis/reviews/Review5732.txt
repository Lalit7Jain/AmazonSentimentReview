I have two of these. I really love them! I marked them four stars because I wish that they had enough of a battery in them that you could unplug it and move it to another room without it having to reboot completely. This is really my only complaint. The sound quality is amazing for such a small device. Alexa does a great job at recognizing everyones speech in the whole house. Whether it is me, or my six-year-old talking to her, she understands it all.
