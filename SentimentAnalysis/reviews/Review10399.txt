There are good points and bad points about this.  The value you get from this will depend on how you plan to use it.  If you have a lot of smart devices (like nest or hue lights) in your home and plan on connecting them up, then you will get a lot of good use from this.  You can also use it to order items on amazon, add items to your Google calendar, play any music you can think of, find your smart phone,  hook it up with IFTTT and other things.  There are over 900 some "skills" that you can download and activate, but no good way to search them to find the best ones in my opinion.  Out of the box it will play music for you, tell you jokes and order things from your Amazon account, and some other things but if you want more functionality you need to enable more skills.  Comes with a small booklet of "things to try"
