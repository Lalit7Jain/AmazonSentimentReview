I bought this for smart home control and it has completely changed that game for me. The voice recognition is second to none. Seamlessly controls my Phillips hue lights, Ecobee thermostat, Lutron blinds and lights. I also find it very useful for playing Spotify on demand. Few things which could be improved still but at this time it's the best voice control option for HA.
