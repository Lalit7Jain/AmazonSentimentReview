I did change the name of the Dots to Kitchen Dot and Bedroom Dot – 1st Dot and 2nd Dot were just too confusing.  It did take me a while (who knows why – short between the operator and the keyboard maybe) to find the zip code/location change screen – it’s on the settings page in the App.  About four minutes after plugging in the Echo I realized that it and the Kitchen Dot were just a smidge too close to each other, so I updated the wake word on the Echo to Echo (it sits near the TV so, that should fix Alexa commercial wake ups too).
