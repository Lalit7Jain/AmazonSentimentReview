Sounds good, my problem with is is that Also have the echo dot and I have to shout when I am 15 feet away to get this to hear me while no music is playing. When I use my Normal voice, the echo that is in 15 feet away and unobstructed by walls will not hear me while the echo dot that is in my bedroom 50 feet away will hear me and respond. I am not impressed with this flaw. Maybe it is just the unit I got?
