I purchased 1 Echo and 2 Echo Dot over the holidays with the interest this is a worthwhile investment, and to see if it provides a benefit to my lifestyle.  Simple installation and up and running in no time.  I have some experience with Tech stuff, Networks, Windows and Android product. This is my first venture into Echo. And I was excited to try it since I’m a Prime and Amazon Unlimited Music user
