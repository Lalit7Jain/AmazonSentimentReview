We had high expectations for the Echo and its just been "okay". Half the time she doesn't understand what we are saying and the rest of the time when we call out songs to play, we only the get a sample version because we decided not to pay the extra $3 a month for amazon music. Why pay more when you can stream pandora through the Echo for free? The speakers are good but I also could have plugged in my laptop as background music. If you plan on using it with a home kit (lights, locks, etc) I'm sure it would be great but not really worth it for anything less than that. I guess for the money we spent on this, we were expecting a little bit more than a glorified speaker.
