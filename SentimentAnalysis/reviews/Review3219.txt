Love love love Alexa! Who knew you could have so much fun with this?! She does just about everything. Every morning during breakfast with my 1 year old grandson I ask her to play baby classical music and she does. Have a question? As expected, she can usually find the answer. Need to know how to spell something, yup, she knows. Or really difficult math problems.  Weather forecast?  Alexa knows. Husband and I are eally enjoying it.
