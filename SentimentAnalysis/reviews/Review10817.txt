Not as much utility as I expected.  I can't remember the stupid phrases to get it to use other apps.  I can't tell Alexa to add songs i ask her to play to my music list.  I can't get her to search outside Amazon for songs.  It keeps trying to force you to buy songs that i can listen to for free elsewhere.  There is no utility to customize how Alexa answers you.  I want her to greet me when I come in or call me by my name when I sak her to do something.
