The other issues of concern is the reliability and durability of the product.  Many customers reported problem with the power adapter going bad and had to wait for a month or more to get a replacement.  If Alexa becomes part of your life, it would be painful to be without for a month or more.  Many customers also reported the unit, Alexa, got a stroke, a heart attack, or caught on fire after a few months to a year, when they are outside of the return or warranty period.  This is a serious quality control issue and need to be address with the manufacturers in China.  Perhaps use the same manufacturers who makes Apple products, I found their products are very reliable.  My power adapter for my iPhone 5S still working on my iPhone 6S.
