The echo is pretty darn neat, at least I thought so until I tried it.  I guess if you're into mainstream pop music and the rest of the general crap you find on the radio then Echo will be perfect for you.  If you like music that isn't so mainstream, in my case power metal and djent, then you're pretty much screwed if you want to use most of Echo's functions.  I have to physically start playing a playlist or album on my phone and have Echo play that just like any other bluetooth speaker can (but for a whole hell of a lot less money), but for the oldies on said phone, it works fine.  So basically the Echo?  So not metal.
