3. Because the Echo doesn't connect to Bluetooth, I was unable to do simple things from my phone or computer like adjust the volume. During the set up process, the volume is very high, and I was unable to turn it down. I couldn't get through the set up process however, because my router was refusing to connect through the software that Amazon want you to use.
