WOW.  This is incredible.  I live alone (yes, some reviewers have said 'it's something to talk to'), but it's much more than that.  With the Echo I can keep a calendar, make lists, listen to what I want to at anytime, etc.  Setting alarms and timers is so very useful, and if I am working on a project Echo will read an audio book while I do that (that's an additional charge, but through Prime I got several credits for free).  I access the Alexa page via PC only because I've not gotten around to (or maybe can't?) access via phone (I'm an android user).
