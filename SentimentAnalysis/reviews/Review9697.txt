Great for music I really enjoy that aspect of it but it's dumb as a bag of hammers and I do talk to it frequently, it doesn't understand alot of what I'm saying and it doesn't answer some basic questions it really needs improvement, it's definitely not OK Google competitive but being a music lover I'll be keeping it.
