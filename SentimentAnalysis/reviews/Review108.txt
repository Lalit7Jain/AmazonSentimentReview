Nice product, but misses the mark for business use. I purchased with the hope of using as sort of a personal assistant for appointments and such.  Voice recognition is above average edging out SIRI and CORTANA just a bit.  While it was easy to set simple appointments, anything with in depth notes requires you to edit the meeting with conventional methods.  Also, it lacks the ability to verbally remind you of appointments and will not label alarms.
