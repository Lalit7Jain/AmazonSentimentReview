absolutely love this! We're not a super tech oriented family but we wanted something with good sound quality and the ability to function well with our family. We home school and this has lots of educational features we love to use. As an fyi when you change it to a wake word other than alexa it doesn't respond well. We tried using echo and it wasn't as responsive. Other than that it's easy to use! Our three kids enjoy it as much as we do.
