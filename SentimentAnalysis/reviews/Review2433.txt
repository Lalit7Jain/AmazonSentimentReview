HUGE HUGE HUGE SECURITY HOLE. ANYONE with a Bluetooth device can connect to this within range. There is NO PIN or any security to prevent someone from connecting to this device. I discovered this when the device reported my neighbor had connected via Bluetooth WITHOUT me doing anything. I was told by "Amazon" that the person connecting "couldn't do anything with it". They pretty much blew me off and opened a "trouble ticket" that went into an Amazon black hole. I'm no expert on Bluetooth, but seems like someone could connect and do malicious stuff with your device. In theory they could order stuff from Amazon Prime, control home automation, open your doors (if you have locks supported by Alexa), and the list goes on and on. What would prevent some "bad guy" from walking by your house, connecting to your device and gathering all kinds of information.
