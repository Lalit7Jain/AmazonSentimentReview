Bought as gift for sister.  She LOVES it, One was given to my son as a gift, he LOVES it.  So I went ahead and bought three more.  The white for my sister's BDAY, and two more(purchase limit) on Black Friday for xmas gifts!! Does too much to list, you have to see it your self. Just buy it...the guy at Best Buy told me they had a demo for Google one, and it wasn't as great. I also do not like the look of the new Google one anyway.  (FYI-- you can listen to itunes through this, just need to use it as a bluetooth speaker, and stream through it that way, can use "Alexa Pause and Alexa skip" with that only)
