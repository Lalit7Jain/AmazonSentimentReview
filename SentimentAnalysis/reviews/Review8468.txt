The echo is tied to amazon music service and has not explicit music settings or parental controls.  The first time my children asked Alexa to play music it play a song by Kendrick Lamar, which was inappropriate for children.  I talked with customer service and there are no changes I can make to prevent this from happening.  Unacceptable.
