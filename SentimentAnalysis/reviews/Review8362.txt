So far the apps or "skills" you can enable on this are pretty touchy and the "google home" apps have much better ratings. So far I feel like I have the lesser of two devices. I was stupid enough to buy two dots to go with it. Thats not to say that it cannot connect to smart devices and do a majority of what it advertises but certain "skills" like the translator apps pale in comparison to google's apps.
