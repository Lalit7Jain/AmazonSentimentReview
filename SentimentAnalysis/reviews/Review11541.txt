Very good at doing a few things, not very flexible. The limitations are in the voice commands. It works well from the app. I haven't been able to get the Amazon Echo to give me a list of available Kindle Audio books or a list of available Ted Talks and things of this nature. If you know exactly what you want to get from the Amazon Echo it works pretty well. If you need to search for something using voice commands it doesn't work very well. There are no options for the Alexa voice response. I hear male voices better than I can hear female voices. There is no option to change Alexa to Alexander
