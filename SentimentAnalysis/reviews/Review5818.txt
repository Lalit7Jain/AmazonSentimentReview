Now I use Alexa mainly for music which is perfect. I was using expensive UE Boom speakers but the Echo blew those out of the water. The best part is Alexa is can be completely hands free so she can change your stations or volume with ease. I loved using this while replacing in the bath! No more drying my hands just to change a song!
