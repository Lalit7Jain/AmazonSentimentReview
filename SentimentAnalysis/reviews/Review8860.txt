At the end of the day...do I NEED Alexa? Nope. But I do not regret the decision! It a very useful, interesting, informative, convenient, device!  I am super happy I added her to my home and I don't think you will be disappointed. IF you are really hesitate to pay full price, be patient and wait for when they go on sale :) That way you do not feel as bad about spending the money! Otherwise, try it out :)
