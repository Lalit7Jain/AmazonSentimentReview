A big disappointment. It was good for news and weather, and the music sounded good, but the Pandora interface was very weak, requiring station changing using the mobile app. Additionally, once I set up Pandora, there was no apparent way to disable it, or change to a different account. The A.I. has a long way to go (but may get there eventually). No interface to iPhone apps such as calendar and contacts. No Netflix interface. Sometime Alexa did not respond to voice control, even when not playing music (had to unplug/reset).
