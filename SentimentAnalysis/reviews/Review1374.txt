Not smart as I thought it was going to be. 80% of the time doesn't understand (don't know) commands. In my opinion speakers are not as good as some reviewers says, for $190 you can buy better bluetooth speakers. Cannot hear when music is playing or if the tv is on, even if the volume is low. I live in a small studio and in order for it to listen the place has be completely silence. Very dissapointed.
