Echo is also GREAT for listening to music or podcasts, and I find the control to be intuitive and easy.  It misses the boat with the web search functionality, however.  When you ask a question that it doesn't know the answer to directly, you'll get an answer like "I'm sorry, I don't know the answer to the question I heard. I have sent Bing search results to the Alexa app." Well.... when I'm asking a question by voice, it's because I need a hands-free response.  I have sent this info to the support staff and they tell me the have added it as a feature request.  I'd really rather it say "According to Bing.... blah blah blah" and then maybe ask if you want more information and it will keep reading.
