The moment you say her name, she's listening. Her range and ability to hear us out really feels good. I have spoken to her from across a room while someone else (in-between me and the device) is playing games on their speakers, talking to their friends on Discord, without issue. You can ask her a variety of questions (When is the next Superbowl? When is the next Green Bay Packers Game? What is the weather? Who let the dogs out?) and she seems to always have a response. If there is something she doesn't know, you can look to expand her skills with the Alexa App. This app is fairly easy to use, though the interface could be smoother (navigating is a tad clunky). I already added skills such as LIFX to control my lights and honestly - this is really fun.
