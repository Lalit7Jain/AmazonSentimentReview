I live in a two bed, two bath apt, only 1100 sq ft.  If I have it so I can hear in the bathroom it is so loud in the living kitchen area that it scares me.  I cannot shut my door or it will not work.  The sound will not go through a wall so can only be used in my 500 sq ft living area, neither of the bedrooms or bath or patio as there is a wall or a door.  It seems stupid to me, can't do much other than weather, time and music sometimes.......I can get that on my phone and when I get an Iphone 7 it will work.  My friends Iphone 7 works better than the echo in my place.  I will wait to get a upgraded phone.
