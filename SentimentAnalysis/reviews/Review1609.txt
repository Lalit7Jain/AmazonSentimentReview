One of the worst things I've purchased on Amazon. It rarely gets music requests even remotely right.  It absolutely cannot understand the difference in a.m./p.m.  And as of tonight other than lighting up for 3 seconds after saying "Alexa"  it will shut back down without taking any commands.  Going to get the google version and trash this thing.
