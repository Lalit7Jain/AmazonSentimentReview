I love my Alexa...when she works.  She seems to have a "hard time understanding right now" a lot.  About every 9-20 minutes she kicks onher red light and is not available.  I know I have less than stellar broadband width.  I tried to connect Lifx lights and they were just to much to support so now I am trying to return those to the company.  It seems like ever since we got the Lifx lights my Alexa has connectivity issues.  Has anyone else had this problem?  Any suggestions?  The lights are back in the boxes.  So I figured Alexa would go back to fully operational but she hasn't.  I constantly have to unplug her and plug her back in or do a complete set up again to make her work.  Even then, she still only lasts for about 20 minutes max.
