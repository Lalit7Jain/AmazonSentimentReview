Works nicely.  The volume and sound clarity is good.  And the white looks good.  It actually forces you to THINK before you ask a question, i.e, your language has to make sense. It only answers questions with definitive answers, i.e., no opinions or predictions (to my knowledge).  I was interested in the music component, but it appears you have to subscribe to Amazon's music library to enjoy that feature.  I use it mostly to give me the top news of the day and answer definitive questions. I'm sure it will become more useful as I link it to different services and devices that I have.  Like most tech items, the more you put into it, the more you'll get out of it.  All in all, a nice product.
