Here is where the Echo has made my life much better. instead of searching for music and connecting a device. Alexa is always connected via wifi and has all amazon music at the ready as well as my music lists i have on  my amazon account. All I need to do is say Alexa play 21 pilots. And its done! music is filling my entire first floor of the house. The sound quality for the size of the device is very good in my opinion. it cant be compared to high quality high priced equipment, but it is unobtrusive and high enough quality to really enjoy at nearly every volume. It gets much louder than even I would ever play it at on a normal day.
