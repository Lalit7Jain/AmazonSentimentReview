I showed my wife the commercial for it right before it was released. She isn't super tech savvy and didn't really see the point. She surprised me when she got me one for our anniversary. We set it up in the kitchen and use it every. single. day. Now there is constantly music playing in our kitchen instead of having to stick a phone into a docking station.  Love that it syncs with Pandora and I honestly would never use my prime music account without it. I am notorious for not putting things I use the last of on the grocery list. Not anymore!  Kitchen timers, news briefs, the kids LOVE asking her to tell jokes. I also love that it is open sourced and constantly evolving. We use her to control our Hue lighting system and have several wemo switches now. Looking forward to adding a Nest thermostat in the near future.
