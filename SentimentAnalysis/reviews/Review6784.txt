Took me a long time to get on board with the echo but I am glad I did!  This thing is awesome.  I have a smart home so it's nice that it works with Ecobee and Phillips Hue to where I can turn on my lights and control my temperature through this.  Speaker is great as well.  Has a hard time hearing my kids sometimes and if i am across the room I do have to repeat myself a couple of times before I see the blue ring to show me it is listening but overall a great device.  I did have both this and google home at the same time to test both devices.  I went with this one due to the third party capabilities.  Google home is more "fun" than this, but this is more functional.  Google home could tell me how to play a card game or and seemed a bit more "human" with the conversation skills but this for me was the overall winner due to smart home capability.  Great job Amazon, keep it up.  The echo dot is awesome as well, I put one in my basement and it turns on my TV through Harmony app and works flawless!
