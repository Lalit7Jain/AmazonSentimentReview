Played Christmas music from Amazon and Pandora all weekend.  It hears me beautifully even from 20' away.  I bought the Echo for my two sons for Christmas and they love it too!  Have not even begun to explore all the possibilities with this awesome little gadget yet.  The sound is comparable (to me) to my Bose Ipod docking station (circa 2002).  And with all my music now uploaded to Amazon Music, I don't need my Ipod or Itunes or Apple at all anymore!
