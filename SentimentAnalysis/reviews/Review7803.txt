We had a lot of fun with this for half a day. Then we tried to play Prime Music on it. That's when the trouble began. We spent the rest of the day linking accounts and jumping through various hoops only to find out that if I have Prime and my wife is the one managing the Echo, we are out of luck. You can share just about everything Prime offers, but you can't share music. I would absolutely recommend this to a Prime member, but it fell flat as a gift to my wife.
