Works well.  Functions like the Echo Dot, but has a much better speaker.  The sound quality is good, and provides good 360 degree sound with decent bass.  As good as any higher-end wireless speaker, though this one does have to remain plugged in w/o an optional battery.  The voice recognition is very good, even from across the room with the music playing.  Alexa skills are pretty diverse, and I've found the music, news, and home automation skills to be most useful.  I'm using it with Wemo and iDevices home automation, as well as a honeywell thermostat.
