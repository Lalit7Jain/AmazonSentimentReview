We've had our Amazon Echo for almost a year now and we love it. We listen to music from it every evening while making dinner. I love that it can access songs from amazons huge library of music. We also use it to set cooking timers, to check out weather and traffic, and to answer questions. Im sure there are so many more things we could be doing with it too. It's definitely changed how our evenings go / it's like we live in the future! We're considering getting a second one for upstairs. I do wish it came with the ability to add an extender. The emails they send every month that let you know about new features are also very helpful.
