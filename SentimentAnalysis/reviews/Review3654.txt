Works as expected. I was a little concerned at sound quality at first using Amazon music, I expected this to sound a lot better than the Dots I already owned. I found while it does sound better it seemed lacking, then I tried using it as a true blue tooth speaker and found it sounds terrific. Meaning the music I had was higher quality than that of the streamed music from Amazon.
