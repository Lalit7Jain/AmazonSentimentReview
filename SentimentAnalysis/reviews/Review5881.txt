A fantastic product.  Speech Recognition is excellent, and with Alexa "she" can integrate with a very wide variety of Smart-Home devices.  I have Echo/Alexa hooked up to control my Philips Hue lighting, for example.  She's always a great companion to have around when you want to hear some music, or ask questions about the weather, sports, or nearly anything.  She'll even tell you some jokes.
