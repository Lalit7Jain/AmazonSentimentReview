She did do a decent job of logically prompting me for information for the appointment item; however, she was not smart enough to decipher what I said about "six months from now" Also, she added the appointment to my Gmail calendar, but did not ask which calendar I preferred (I have two calendars linked to it). Also, when I asked it about the weather I got an answer to my satisfaction.
