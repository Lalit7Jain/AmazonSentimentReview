I like the Echo, Alexa plays the songs I want to hear whenever I request. She also answers most of my questions and can control lights in your home. I do however have a problem with the echo not responding to my commands at times, which is very annoying. I find the echo very useful for getting answers to most of my questions, that is when it responds. The speakers don't sound too bad at all, for the size of the Echo, music sounds pretty good also. Setup is fairly easy when App is downloaded. You will have to connect the Echo to your wifi connection when prompted, so have your password ready at setup. Echo will get used to your voice the more you use it, making it better to use. The Echo seems to be able to hear me when i'm pretty far away and can also hear you over the music when you are listening. You can ask Echo to raise or lower the volume, or you can do it manually by turning your hand on the top, as if you were unscrewing or screwing tight a jar, only you don't have to squeeze just slide your hand clockwise to increase volume and counter clockwise to decrease volume. If you do have a problem like I do with the Echo not responding, you do have a manual button on top of Echo that you can push for a command. Echo does not use batteries, you have to plug it in with the power cord supplied, so if your thinking of taking it to the beach, forget it, but you could buy the amazon Tap which will play music off battery life if you need to be on the go or you could buy the optional battery stand, for like $50, I think it has 9 - 18 hours of battery life depending which one you buy. Anyway, I'm very happy I made the purchase, I'm enjoying all the things Echo does for me.
