My daughter loves the movie Moana and would always ask Alexa to play songs from the movie which she did but they were samples only.  We decided to buy the soundtrack on Amazon and we're pleasantly surprised.that when my daughter asked to here Moana song samples the entire songs played (before the CD arrived).
