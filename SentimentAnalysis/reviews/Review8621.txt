Make sure you check the Alexa App reviews in iTunes(I did not). The app is so bad Echo is useless. I have been trying for over an hour to get the app to load. I've turned my phone off-on, deleted and re-downloaded the app several times. For some reason it started working after turning off my cellular data while connected to WiFi??? Not sure if thats some kind of fix. Now that I have gotten into the app, it just keeps saying "The Alexa app is offline...". I haven't even been able to get past the "Intro to Echo" in the app. $140 paper weight! I have an iPhone 5S.
