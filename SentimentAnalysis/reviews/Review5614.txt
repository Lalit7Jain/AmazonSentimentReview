Love the Amazon Echo.  I purchased this one to replace the black one in our kitchen since our kitchen is mostly white.  Love it!  Wish Amazon would sell "skins" or shells for these.  If you're wondering about buying an Amazon Echo for the first time, Do It.  "She" is amazing, and keeps getting better with the improvements that her team keeps cooking up. I know for new comers it may seem unnatural to talk to your house/device, but understand it doesn't take long before it's second nature.  Lastly, the Echo is one of the most compatible home automation devices out there with its ability to coonect with other branded devices.... from home automation brains to thermostats, and even alarm systems.  This is most likely one of the most supported device out there.
