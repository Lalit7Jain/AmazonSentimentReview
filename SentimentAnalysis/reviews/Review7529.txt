I really do love this silly little device. Especially for music, you can hook up your Spotify and she can find everything. Great verbal recognition, even from across the room. I'm giving four stars because there needs to be a user guide that is easily accessible...I'm sure they're trying to take the Apple route and not provide directions to keep it simple and for the human to be intuitive, but a device like this needs a guide, especially with features. I can do my own research...but I'd rather not!
