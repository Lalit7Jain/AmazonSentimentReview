Where would I be without Alexia?  I have to admit that one of my most guilty pleasure shopping splurges has been the Amazon Echo and I totally love it!! There are a million and one things that my Alexia can do, and I love that it continually learns.  You never know the full array of features it offers until you actually own one and begin to use and customize it to your specific needs/likes.  I honestly feel that I hardly utilize mine to the fullest capacity.  You can ask it to wake you up, read you a story, play you music, give you recipes, it even kept me up to date with the debate polls.
