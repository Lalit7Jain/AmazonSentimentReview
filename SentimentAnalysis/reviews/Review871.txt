Love it. Set it up last night. Took more that expected to get set up. I ordered the dot also and seems that it is the app that is giving some problems. But after I got off of wifi and went to cell data it seem to go quicker. Had the alarm set up this morning to wake me and it did. So far grate product. Will work with it more this weekend in case I need to re-review the product. Both came packed together and was a grate packing job. Shipping we right on time also.
