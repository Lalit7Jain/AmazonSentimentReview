  Books: I love to read and have lots of eBooks.  Echo can "read" anything in your Kindle library; no other e-reader libraries.  Alexa darling, the sound of your voice could test the patience of a saint.  Why would I want to listen to you read a novel to me?  Besides, the whole point of being an avid reader and buying books, is to actually read them!
