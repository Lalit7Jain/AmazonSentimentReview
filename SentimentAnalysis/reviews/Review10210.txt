The setup is very easy, just plugging it in, connecting it to wifi via the app and then reading off a list of 25 commands so it can configure to your voice.  It is definitely not something that everyone will find useful or see as a must have, but if you have seen the commercials or looked into it and are intrigued by at least some of the things it can do then I definitely think it (especially at the reduced holiday price) is worth the expense.  Even if you are looking for a reasonably priced bluetooth speaker this will give you that functionality and a lot more.
