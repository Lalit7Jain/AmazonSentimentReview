I love Alexa, she's basically become the center piece in our living room and is probably creeped out with how many weird things we ask of her. I play music as much as possible, so adding Pandora, Spotify, and other apps was wonderful to me. My mother (who I bought it for as a Christmas present) loves listening to the news and getting recipes from Alexa. And my brother (who hates electronic talking devices) will connect his bluetooth and play endless loops of "It's the end of the world as we know it" until we tell her to shut up. She just needs one walkthrough to connect to the wifi, and you can ask her to just add apps and things on as you go. The only thing I have a problem with is that it doesn't seem to be able to answer complicated questions like the dreaded Google search, so forget about asking a weird question. "Alexa, where it China located?", she'll answer with "China is a country located in Asia close to Russia". The best things about Alexa has to be the Easter eggs you can find, I learned that Alexa is a HUGE Star Wars nerd and just for that she's welcome in our house.
