First off, the Amazon voice service is pretty amazing for most of the things I want to do. I ask Alexa about the weather, news headlines and things like that each morning to start my day. I also use it to play music easily when I'm getting ready, and also use it to set timers and stuff like that when I'm doing various activities. If you don't mind dropping nearly $200 to add a few extra minutes back in your schedule, it's pretty great for that.
