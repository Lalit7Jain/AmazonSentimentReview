I got my echo when they first cam out and I finally am getting around to writing a review. I wish you could give half stars because from day one it is a solid 4.5 stars for me. I use mine not everyday but probably 3-4 times a week. I play music for my kids at morning breakfast, turn off my lights when I'm feeling lazy, and I even reset my temperature in my house when the wife turns the ac up past 75 degrees. Mine sits on my kitchen counter and with the open floor plan of my house Alexa can hear me from my din, breakfast nook as well as my living room if I talk loud enough. I got mine for $99 so the cost was not that bad for me, but if I had to pay the $179 price tag for it now I don't know if I would have got it. All in all I love this device and could live with out it, but why when Alexa gets me. She's like a second wife.
