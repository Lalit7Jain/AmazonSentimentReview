Amazing AI that gets better with time. Privacy was a concern, but the mute button keeps Alexa sleeping when you don't need assistance.  Just the beginning, AI will be a part of every HH in the next generation. 4 stars vs 5 since there needs further product development-fairly great.  Love the device.
