I would have given it 5 stars except for one maddening fault. When you tell it to turn on or off a device it  ALWAYS says "I found multiple devices with that name. Which device did you mean?" after witch you repeat exactly what you said the first time and it does what you asked. If it at least let you repeat the device name before it finished it wouldn't be so bad, but after 100 times it still always asks for the device name again and it gets extremely frustrating!!!!
