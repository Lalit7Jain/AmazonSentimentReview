Really like the product, i can ask Alexa to play music while i am cooking or cleaning and the hands free option is amazing, my accent is reallybatring and still alexa will understand every question i ask. THe only problem is i though Alexa will use a computer base libraru to answer very common  questions like google or bing but it does not do it in that way. ANd when i ask her to repeat a chapter of the book in audible, she is asking for the chapter number, and usually she goes from chapter to chapter without out knowledge the chapter. SO i got no progress in that area, and when she finished a book if you want to come back to it, there no progress in that matter either
