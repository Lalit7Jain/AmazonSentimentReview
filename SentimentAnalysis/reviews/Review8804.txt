I think Alexa is cool as it can be, as it is very good at speech recognition, a lot better than Cortana in Windows 10 which brings me to my main reason for writing this review, the very same technology that is in Echo will be in Windows 10 next year next to Cortana, starting in March (Redstone 2 update) it will be called Home Hub, yes it will do it all, smart plugs too. Will update it further update it with Redstone 3, then update when warranted.
