Oh my gosh, how did we survive before we bought the Echo!!! Bought it for my husband and we both use it on a daily basis. Love being able to play my Amazon Cloud music. And the grandkids love asking it questions when they visit. Use the timer feature a lot!! And of course, having the weather given to you everyday is nice. And it is nice that it is updated with new features to use often.
