We have also recently noticed a substantially more frequent issue with the Echo waking when the wake word has not been used than we ever had at the beginning (in the learning phase). Add to that the fact that usage of the wake word is becoming less likely to actually initiate the Echo to wake with each passing day, and it is almost unbearable to have Alexa plugged in at all. In fact, when we updated the password for our home's internet access, not too long ago, it was literally days before we bothered to update the Alexa app with this new information. In fact, if it had not been for the convenience of being able to use her as a kitchen timer in that moment, our Echo would probably still be sitting idly by, disconnected from the rest of our household technology.
