4.  The Hue Lighting system isn't a seamless program. I have to do some things by logging on to the Hue app and others through Alexa.  So I can tell Alexa to turn my lights on to a certain percentage.  However, if I want the lights to slowly turn themselves on in the morning, I have to set that through the Hue app. If I am wrong and this can all be done through Alexa, it's not through an intuitive way of doing it.
