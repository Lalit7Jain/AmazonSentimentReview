I got this about a year ago as a gift from my kids. Limited uses and was basically used as a weather info center before I left for work.  I moved and recently decided to plug it in again and see what new features it has.  Unfortunately, the Echo app doesn't work (won't log me in, but keeps asking me for my pw then says I need to log in...  AAAAAAAGGGH!)
