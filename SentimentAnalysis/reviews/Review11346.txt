I'm a tech junkie, and this thing is a major tech "fix"  They have done an excellent job with the speech recognition side of it, and the search engine that they use to get the answer to your request is almost perfect.  I go t this for my wife as a birthday present, and she loves it.  I think her favorite thing is being able to add things to the shopping list during the week, and just pulling up the app at the store, and everything is right there on the phone.
