Got my echo dot 2nd generation today, all 6 of them.  None works.  My 1st gen Echo is still works well; however, none of the new echo dot 2nd generation works.  I got the setup up to the point my iPhone connected to the echo dot.  Then, the setup just error out with the error code 558170320.  I thought I got one bad device; then I tried another and then another and none of them works.
