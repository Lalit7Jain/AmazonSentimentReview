Per my boyfriend, "Alexa is my new girlfriend." We have yet to tap into all her utility, but so far she's been a great companion to friend's child by answering questions, my boyfriend and me by settling arguments via fact checking, picking playlists based on what I announce my mood to be, and informing me of the weather as I am rushing around in the morning getting ready for work. I can't wait to work through all other functions.
