The Speaker is an amazing quality and I love how easy it is to get information.  I use it all of the time.  Sometimes to listen to my music, radio or audiobooks.  Other times, I ask simple questions about weather, time, cooking math (i.e.how many tablespoons in a 1/4 cup).  I add things to my to-do and shopping list right as they pop in my head.  All of this I can easily do from my smartphone, but I under estimated the value and convenience of the voice commands.  Plus, now when the kids do homework, Alexa can handle many of their questions.  (i.e. spelling)
