I must admit I was skeptical but I love our Echo. It's voice recognition works well the majority of the time and the sound quality is good. The radio function is really useful. The microphone is located on the top of the unit which doesn't work super well in our context because we have to have it up higher so the kids keep off it...it still works fine but sometimes you have to raise your voice a little more.
