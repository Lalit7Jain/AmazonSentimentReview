I've had my Alexa for about 9 months now and love her!!! She's so handy for shopping lists, timers, playing Tune In radio, and telling jokes, and that's only the tip of the iceberg!  There are a million more features that I haven't even gotten to using, but am planning to in the future, such as the audio books and smart home commands for turning on lights. I would definitely recommend Alexa...and she's sooooo much better than Siri!!!!
