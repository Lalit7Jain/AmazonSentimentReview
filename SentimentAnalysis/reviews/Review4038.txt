The browser site where you are supposed to get the Alexa app seems to be nothing more than a log in site and provides a tiny bit of instructions and you have to keep logging. I tried reset the echo.using the bottom pin and the top pin hole nothing changed. Reset the router and shut down and started my computer, no help. the Echo just with the orange circle spinning. They misinformed about using a browser and I do not have the correct I phone to get Alexa app. So here I set with a $179 device that does nothing except provide a little flashing light.
