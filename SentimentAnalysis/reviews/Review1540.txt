Honestly, it's a first generation thing, and any cons are just part of the growing process. This thing is really cool though. I hope the next iteration can fulfill those last few items on my cons list... ultimately, I hope to do as little as humanly possible, hopefully Alexa's future can provide this... hopefully they don't go all Cyberdyn on us - fingers crossed!
