First of all, I have to compliment the Customer Service Reps for Amazon - they are the best - the Echo takes a wee bit of setting up because there are some issues one has to deal with getting use to it - the sound is fantastic - each morning, I ask Alexa to play one of my favorite artists and it does wonders for the mental attitude - the only thing that disappoints me is that Amazon did not consider the possibility that the user might want to use the audio book feature to listen to their favorite books in bed - I have a large Kindle library and most of the books are available in an audio format - however, I can't use them without disturbing my wife - also, Alexa reads the books fast and, since many of my books are on ancient history, the speed of her reading makes it difficult to digest the material - I've been informed that Amazon is working on correcting these items and will hope for a solution in the not too distant future
