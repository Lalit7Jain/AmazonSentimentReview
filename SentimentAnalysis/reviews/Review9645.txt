We have been using Alexa regularly since we bought it. We like it so much that we also bought another echo dot. We use it to listen to music, news, turn the lights on and off, set alarms and timers and so many other things. It is fun to discover what else Alexa can do every day. Did not realize how useful and fun Alexa can be till we really started using it.
