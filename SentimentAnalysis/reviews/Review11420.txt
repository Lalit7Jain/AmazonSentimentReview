Adding and learning.  This has been fun for my entire family.. Plus we are adding unlimited accessories to our "smart home"  I feel this will be an energy saver as well as a fun convenience item..  Alexa......set timer for 10 min...  Alexa.... play coldplay......alexa turn off the porch lights..  too much fun..  Even my kids love to ask Alexa to tell them a joke.
