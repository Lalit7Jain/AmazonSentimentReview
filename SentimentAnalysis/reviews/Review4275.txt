I had to get this one after getting the Gen 2 Dot that I hooked up to my Stereo System. I got this one because of the built in Speakers for my Bed Room & will use it as a new Voice activated Clock Radio for Alarms. This thing is absolutely awesome. It will even spell words for you. Lord knows I'm a bad Speller & when I'm writing letters & such & I need correct spelling of any Word or definition, Alexa will answer.  Another thing I found out, be sure to call her by her correct name or She will get mad at you & won't answer. LOL  :)  I was able to add this second one to my network in 10 mins. Looking at setup video's on you tube I learned alot. A few people had problems with the setup for both.
