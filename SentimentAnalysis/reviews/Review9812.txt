Fantastic.  We love it.  Very well done.  My wife and I are really enjoying our Echo.  I bought it on Black Friday on a whim, and I'm happy I did.  We are playing a lot of music, but I am finding that I am really enjoying all of the other features.  Fun stuff.  We decided to buy another one for a family member for Christmas.  Good job Amazon.
