It can do those tasks without having to pick up your phone or grabbing your tablet/laptop.  This technology is new so please don't assume it can do everything.  Its a cool toy that is fun to have in your home.  I can see Echo having a lot more depth as they develop it more.  For now enjoy it for what it is and impress your guests.
