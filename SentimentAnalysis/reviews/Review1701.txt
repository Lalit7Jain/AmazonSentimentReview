I bought an inexpensive Alexa guide book to enhance the experience as I learn more and more what Alexa can do. A guide book is not required, because it's so easy to use, however I still recommend as an additional very useful tool. You will learn tons more features much more quickly with a guide book. I bought, The 2017 Updated User Guide, by Jennifer N. Smith. So glad I did! Thumbs up!
