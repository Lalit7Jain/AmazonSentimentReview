That being said, there are some shortfalls. I appreciate that the 3 Echo systems can distinguish from each other and only the closest one will respond, but i do wish they would work in tandem as well. I know there are shortcuts around some of these issues, but a little more cooperation across all my Alexa platforms would be useful in ways I probably haven't even considered.
