Google Home answers a lot more questions, and you don't need to enable Skills to do other things. I can ask it how to make an old fashioned and it tells me, whereas on Alexa you need to word it just right and have the bartender skill enabled. Alexa seems more "polished" than Home, though, and with Prime she has a great music library, and she can tell me "where's my stuff" when I'm waiting for an Amazon order. Then again Google Home is improving by the day, and has the power of Google behind it. For example, I can ask Home for a flight status but Alexa is lost if I ask her.
