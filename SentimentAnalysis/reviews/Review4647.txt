This is one of the best purchases I've ever made. My sister has one and that's how I found out about it. This comes in handy for so many things. I ask it the weather and traffic for my drive to work every day and it's never steered me wrong. I also love that it can pair up with your fitbit device to read your stats so that you don't have to check your phone. I play spotify on this daily and it's never had a problem as far as playing what I ask it to. This has also helped me out with grocery shopping. I used to always come home after shopping and say "oh I forgot this or that." Not anymore! It's so easy to just say "add this to my shopping list" from anywhere in the house so that I don't forget when I get to the store. Absolutely love Alexa!
