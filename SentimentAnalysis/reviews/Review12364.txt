Echo is a really cool item to have, IF you're tech savvy.  There is so much this little thing can do, from play music, order pizza, a cab, turn your lights on and off.....control your heat and ac.  Must have for the tech-geek in your house!  I still have to learn more about mine and buy the new lights!  They are a bit expensive.  I'm waiting for them to cheapen up a bit.  Also going to expand a few places to the DOT.  Only down fall with this is that the speaker could be of better quality.  It's not horrible.....but I'm picky when it comes to music and how it sounds.
