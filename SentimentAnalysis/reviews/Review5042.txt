I am very thrilled with my echo, I volunteer at the hospital 4 days a week, come home, not much to watch on T V but I ask Alexia to play some soft easy listening music and  she does,  so great and relaxing.  When you are over 80 you want a little calm in you life and something that doesn't take a lot of brain work to use.  So easy, thank you.
