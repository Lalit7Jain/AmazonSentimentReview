Great sound, with tons of skills.  It works great as a music player/audiobook reader with its ability to connect to services like Audible, Prime Music or Bluetooth audio devices but the fun doesn't stop there.  Since I received my echo, it has become the control for my Hue lights (purchased because of Echo integration), a morning news source and a daily Jeopardy dose with  "Jeopardy J6". And it has a surprising range: I can be heard from almost any place in my apartment.
