Opened yesterday...Going back today. Alexa is not as smart as I thought she was. I guess I expected too much of out this thing. After I used it, I thought, I am now getting way too lazy, just like the rest of the world. I am capable of playing my own music and looking up my own information. It seemed like every question I asked alexa, she had to answer for. I feel like I was hoodwinked. Back it goes!
