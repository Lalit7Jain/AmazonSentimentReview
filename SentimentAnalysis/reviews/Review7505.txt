I am using my Echo every day. Starts in the morning with a "Good morning", onto the weather for the day, and then my news update. During the day I love the unbelievable collection of songs supplied via my Amazon Prime account. Only wish we could synch my Apple Calendar with Alexa.....come on Jeff Bezos.....talk to Tim Cook.
