I was so excited for this product, but over the last several months I've grown incredibly weary of her "Sorry, I didn't understand that question" responses-- her knowledge and capabilities are far too limited. Google Home is substantially smarter and more adept at providing access to requested info. Amazon Echo, unfortunately, is just a glorified speaker (but a great, omni-directional one).
