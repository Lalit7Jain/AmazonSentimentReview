I bought my Echo mostly so I could play Pandora with a decent spearker in my bedroom.  She's fabulous for that.  It's also fun to ask her various questions and have it answered correctly.  She'll also wake me up in the morning, which is nice.  She's super handy and just awesome for music play.  Her listening ability is top notch, much better than a phone, so you're not having to repeat yourself all the time.
