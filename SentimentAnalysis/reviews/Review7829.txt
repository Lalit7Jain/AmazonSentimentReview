I don't know if we got a dud or what, but so far, our Alexa sucks. I mean, this Echo couldn't even recognize basic things like the fact that George Michael passed away today or the Bowl Game dates of major sports teams. We also continually got "samples" of songs - WHEN she could recognize them. If we are this hamstrung by the Bing search engine, this will be for sure returned for Google Home. (As a side note, this is one of maybe three reviews I have ever felt compelled to post.) The thing that kept this from being one star is the speaker, which is quite good.
