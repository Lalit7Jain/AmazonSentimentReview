I purchased this system less than ONE month ago and it's already giving me problems. I keep my echo in a safe and secure spot, in an outlet of its own. There's no reason in the world for this system to already stop working. The Echo will acknowledge that I've said "Alexa," as the blue indicator light turns and faces me, but it will not respond to my command. It simply shuts the indiactor light off or, on the rare occasion, it will quickly flash red and turn off. The Echo is connected to a secure and steady network and I've tried signing in and out of the Alexa app with no luck. It has worked perfectly fine up until today. Total waste of money- extremely disappointed.
