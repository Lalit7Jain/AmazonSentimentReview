Echo is so much fun.  I initially ordered the black and then gave it to family.  They love it too. The sound quality is great.  I loved it so much, I ordered the white and the Dot for another room.  I hope Alexa continues to get more skills. The only thing and it is not a negative, I hesitate choosing too many skills as I wish there was a better way to make sure the developer is a "safe" one.  Have had enough problems with viruses, etc.  How can we tell?
