Love the concept, but Alexa is pretty dumb compared to Siri.  If the voice recognition and intelligence picks up this can be a game changer.  I'm a bit of an audiophile so I don't usually listen to music on inferior speakers, but I find myself using this a lot while washing dishes.  It is great to use my voice to control what I listen to.
