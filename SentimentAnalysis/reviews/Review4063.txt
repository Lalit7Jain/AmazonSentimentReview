She's not as smart as I thought she'd be. Ask her many questions about history and she had no answer for many questions and too short answers for others. She wont divulge if she's gay or straight or what her political leanings are too LOL... but for real! And she doesn't hold tons of music like I thought. You have to download apps to get the music. And it's hard to get her to link what you want to what she has. You have to keep rewording your command. She's a good expensive alarm clock, radio, notebook and calculator machine.
