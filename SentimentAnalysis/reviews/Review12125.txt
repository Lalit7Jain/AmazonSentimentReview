If I ever had gotten my library in there on a trial basis, I’d probably have gone ahead and used it – maybe even paid for a subscription, though certainly not Unlimited music. But Amazon’s trial software doesn’t work yet to show me that my music library would ever work, so why should I keep banging my head on the wall trying force Echo to work as advertised?
