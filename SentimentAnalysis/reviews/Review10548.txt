Bought just because I liked the concept and thought it would just be a fun novelty.  Wow was I wrong. Have owned for over a year and continually find more uses for Alexa.  If you don't already know what it can do, read the product page.  I don't think a single day goes by that I do not use one of the many features, experiment with the substantial list of easter eggs or just play music.  By the way,  these go to 11.
