been wanting one of these for a long time.  well i got it.  looks great but was a bit of a pain to set up.  the app was a bit wonky and i had to uninstall and reinstall several times before it worked.  well got it set up and then everything i wanted to do with it i had to enable it through the "skills" portion of the app.  i think it should have already been enabled with all skills to begin with..  but anyhoo..  the sound is good but not what i expected for this price. asking it questions are so-so  about 50% of the time it won't know what you are asking or come up with nothing.  playing music is easy but be prepared to pay an extra 3.99 a month for music even if you have a prime account cause otherwise it will only play samples of anything you ask it to play.. and if you are playing music loudly with it you will have to almost scream ALEXA for it to hear you. and a huge huge huge thing is that it will NOT read your e-books as written.  i purchased the game of thrones e-books and most of the cuss words were bleeped out.  i did not buy this to have it censor my ebooks.  they should have a parental filter that you can turn on or off not decide for me!  i like it a lot but it still needs a lot of work..
