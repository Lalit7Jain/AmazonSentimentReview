Some of her jokes are pretty good, which are a great pick me up sometimes. I always know what time it is and what the weather is or will be like. The biggest thing I can suggest, is I have heard people say they have had problems with Alexa responding during an echo commercial...Mine did as well....So if you don't want her ordering Dominos or anything else for you when you don't want her to. There is an easy way to solve that set a pin code. So nothing can be ordered unless you give her the pin code...SIMPLE!!! You can dress her up with custom wraps if you like, so she matches your style tastes as well.
