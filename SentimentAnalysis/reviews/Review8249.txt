This is a wonderful device but there is the hope that OS will receive development and updates in the near future. One downside that I have seen so far is that this device is app dedicated. For example, when Alexa starts a timer the user can only pause the timer through the app rather that saying Alexa>pause timer. It is unfortunate that the device is dedicated to the wall ac adapter rather than being able to take it from room to room and then charge it with the wall adapter. My family has enjoyed it for the past week but have the hope for more updates with the skills, apps, and OS. I'm attempting to connect my smart tv through Bluetooth with Alexa for an additional speaker in the room. It is nice that we were able to pair our two Amazon fire tv remotes to the Alexa device.
