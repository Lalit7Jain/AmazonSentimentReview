Only leaving 4 instead of 5 stars due to when she's playing anything over volume 5 she doesn't respond to her name and needs to have you walk over and push her action button to get her attention. Superb sound, nice features.  Just improve her response rate and make her a little smarter for general questions and she would be a 10 rating.
