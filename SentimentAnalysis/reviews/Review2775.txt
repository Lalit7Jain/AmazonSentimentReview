Well, I have not owned the Echo very long but I can tell already she is very user friendly.  Much more than a speaker and I love all the skills that are available as Alexa will not become obsolete.  Her voice is pleasant and so far she understands my words.  I would highly recommend that if you did your research, just go for it.  With technology there is always going to be second guesses as you ponder what is the best thing to purchase.  I finally just went with it and glad I did.
