This is by far the best investment I have made in years...I basically use my Echo and Echo Dot for music purposes. The sound is excellent! I still make purchases of CD's occasionally, but that is solely for the purpose of using the auto rip system which goes into My Music, which plays through my Echo and Echo Dot. I haven't had any problems with either the Echo or the Echo Dot.
