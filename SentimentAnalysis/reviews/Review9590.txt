From a review perspective, if you are looking for a mature product with lots of integrations/recipes to smart devices you use today, then Amazon Echo/Dot is a clear winner and you will not be happy with the relative immature nature of Google Home. I am shocked that Google didn't spend the money upfront to have significantly more recipes/integrations prior to releasing this product to effectively complete against Echo. The big feature you hear about on reviews is Google Home's ability to carry context from one question to next.  For me, If I am going to do some multi-question thing, I am not going to talk to my device, I'm just going to grab my phone or tablet, which renders this feature relatively useless to me.  The only cool feature I like is Home's ability to to cast to Chomecast audio.  It is really nice.  I hope Amazon figures out a way for me to link all my Dots and Echo together, so I can "cast" to Dots. So before you buy anything, make sure it integrates with the services you have today. The promise from Google of future integration is nice, however, knowing google's track record of sunsetting products, don't hold out too much hope for the long term.
