I love the concept of it, but it's not working for me. Purchase the Echo, worked fine the first day the second day had trouble with it, not responding to my commands. reboot it, unplug it, you name it I did it same responds. send it back and received a second one with the same results. Sorry, hope they come out with a better one.
