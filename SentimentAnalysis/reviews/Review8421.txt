I'm afraid I like this a little too much. Every morning I say good morning to get the day's interesting tidbits. I ask what the day's deals are on Amazon, and so far I've ordered dog treats. The dog is happy about that. I've played 20 question and some other word game. I play music a lot more often because it's easy to turn it on or off or change the volume or skip a song. And if I want to know the name of a song, I can ask, which is useful. I check the weather, use it as a timer, check my activity on Fitbit, create shopping and to-do lists, and check what I have on my calendar.
