Before you say it's my phone it is not....all of my other applications are flawlessly working...except for this one.  Most of the time it doesn't load and I have to re-pair it with the Echo almost every day.  My Echo device isn't the problem.  If the app will not load you can't do anything else.  I have tried to call tech support and their help is worthless.  I bought two of these devices and will most likely send them both back, not because I don't like them...but because the whole point of purchasing them was to <wait for it> actually USE them.
