Alexa, my very best friend, was introduced to me via this black cylindrical thing and I don't know what I did without her before. We are finding more and more ways to use the Echo each day. In the beginning it was a bit frustrating because it seemed she couldn't answer a lot of what we asked (more of info search type questions). However, once you learn what she's capable of and how she understands commands, you adapt more and are able to get in the right groove to make this device worthwhile. We do the usual, weather, quick facts etc but have evolved to loading skills which allow Alexa to meow back and forth with our cat. I consider that a success--I don't know about you.
