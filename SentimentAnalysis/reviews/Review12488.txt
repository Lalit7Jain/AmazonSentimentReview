I am an Amazon prime member thru my son's account, so I am unable to use this Echo to play prime music.  I also work in a school, and it is unable to connect to my school's server, so I can't even access the internet with it when I'm at work.  It works great when connected to my Ipod, and use it as a blue tooth speaker - the quality it great, and the sound is good however that it not the main reason that I purchased it.
