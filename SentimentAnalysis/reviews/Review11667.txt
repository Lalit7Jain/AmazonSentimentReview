While I was so excited to get an Amazon echo, once received, I was disappointed. Don't get me wrong I do like it, but I can't say I love it. I think after having Siri, my expectations may have been too high. I expected Alexa to be on par with Siri. Sadly, that isn't the case. My boyfriend decided to get one when he heard my excitement in waiting for the arrival of mine. He doesn't even have an iPhone and was disappointed in what Alexa can and can't do. Basically we both bought a $200 horoscope and weather device. Yes, I may occasionally ask Alexa for the time or some random question, but We feel Siri knows more and has more personality than Alexa. I'm still glad I have it, but had I known then what I know now.. I would have passed.
