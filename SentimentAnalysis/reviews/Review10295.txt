The other unforgivable sin is that Alexa wants to shuffle.  She wants to shuffle so badly that when you put a whole album into your playlist Alexa shuffles the content on reading the list.  That's right, there is no way to turn off shuffle until after the shuffling has already occurred.  Put the album "Toscanini complete Beethoven Symphonies" and Alexa will start with the first movement of the 5th, then the first movement of the 9th, etc.
