I use this as my bedroom alarm clock/radio.  It is very easy to use and can pickup your voice even with music playing.  The biggest issue is that each command is separate and you cannot combine them.  Basically, you need to speak like a machine for the machine to understand.  For example, "Alexa...(wait)....play music."  "Alexa....(wait)...turn down volume"  "Alexa...(wait)..change station"  The command section should stay on for another 5-10 seconds to see if another one is issued.  Similar issue when getting your daily feed/news.  This would make the device much more user friendly and intuitive.
