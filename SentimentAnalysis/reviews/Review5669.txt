I have an echo in the kitchen  and I put a dot in my bedroom.  My echo is useful  when it comes to my grocery  list,  as a timer when I'm  cooking (or burning) food, checking the weather, etc. Makes conversions easy.  It can spell and give you the definition of words, answer most of my questions and more.  Bought one for my son too. I'm hoping it will soon be able to tell time in 24 hour format.  This is the best gadget  I've ever bought period.
