Wow!  I'm a tech junkie and I was blown away by this gadget!  Set-up was a breeze with the iPhone app.  The music ability alone is enough for me to own the echo, but the ability to control my Nest thermostats is a nice bonus.  I've already ordered 2 dots for the kitchen and bedroom to pair with my existing bluetooth speakers.  Nice job Amazon!
