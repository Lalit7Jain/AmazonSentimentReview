In my household, we started out with an Echo that we received as a gift. Since then, we've purchased 4 Echo Dots for various rooms in the house. Probably the most popular feature is that Echo allows you to play music using voice control. Sadly, as a music player, Echo is severely limited to the point of being annoying.
