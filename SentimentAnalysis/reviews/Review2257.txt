The echo setup took only about five minutes.  However,  the app seems to have problems.  After it set up the echo in our network, I opened the app back up to see what other features it had... but the app just freezes and does nothing else.  The only two options you get is "connect to your device" and the video "learn how to use your device".  So, everything is great with the device itself, but I thought I could use the app for other stuff other than just set it up.  Weird.  I am using an iphone 7 plus.  comments anyone?
