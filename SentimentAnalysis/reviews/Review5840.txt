We ended up returning the Echo.  You have to activate certain skills in order to ask questions about certain topics and there are so many of them.  Then you have to phrase your question in a specific way (using the exact words).  I found very little added value to having it. Also, I found the "searches" into Amazon for products to be very tedious and not useful.  I'm sure there are many folks out there that love it - it was just not for me.
