After seeing this at my daughter's house, when the deal came up I decided to order one. Am not disappointed at all and each week I get an email update on whats new with Alexa. I have yet to tap the true potential of this but it is great and the grandson loves to ask her to tell him a cat or dog joke.  Have enjoyed this one so much that I have ordered one as a gift (they loved it when at our house) for the holidays.
