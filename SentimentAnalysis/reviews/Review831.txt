I love my Echo. I use it mostly for music, weather & alarms. I love the way it does the grocery list however I use Seri instead as I have low vision & the font color of Alexa's list is too hard for me to read in the store. Seri has a font, good spacing & bold black print that is easy to see. I wish Amazon would change that feature. Another wish would be, under settings if there would be a way to adjust Alexa's speech speed. She has a nice pleasant voice but having a little control over her speech speed would be nice. All in all, I LOVE her.
