I had been considering getting the Amazon Echo for a while. I had done my research on it, seeing what kind of features it had and what people were saying about it. I finally made the decision to buy it. I have to say that I am very pleased with it so far, I have only had it two days now. Alexa is 10x better that Siri. She is all around awesome. The speaker inside is great, way better than any other I have ever used. I don't remember seeing this in the description, but I found out that you can connect your phone and play your own music. I would definitely buy this again and would recommend this to anyone.
