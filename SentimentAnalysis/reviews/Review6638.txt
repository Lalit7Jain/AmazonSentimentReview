I ask for my new flash and the first news comes from Fox news. I always have to increase the volume from where it was it to hear the news. This is followed by NPR liberal news. Echo broadcast NPR at least two volume levels above Fox's volume level and I have to turn ask echo to turn it down. Why wouldn't the volume be consistent no matter what I listen to?
