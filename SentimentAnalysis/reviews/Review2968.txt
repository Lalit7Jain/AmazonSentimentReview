Many additional charges for actual full functionality.  For example, you may be paying for Amazon prime, but you have to pay for Prime Music too in order to get full expected functional from the music - when asked for a specific song by Title and Artist, results sometimes meet expectations (however, if you ask for Bonnie Tyler, I need a hero, you get a HS marching band - in what way did you ask for a HS band?!).  This or the homelink functions require a 'hub' product (up to $60), then the actual product to turn on or off ($20 for a lightbulb to do this).
