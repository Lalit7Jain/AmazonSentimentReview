Greatest product I have bought in the last two years. Have one in the living room and one in master bedroom. This is a no-brainer and truly is an item for that someone who has everything. For Seniors they control or ask questions with their voice, saves getting up to change stations, play lists or adjust volume again all by your voice. What more could you ask for...........? Do not hesitate on this one and do not wait for the price to change.
