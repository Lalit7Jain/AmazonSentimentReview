Arrived on time and was exactly what I had expected. I had done my research on these for a while and finally decided to get one. I like the option of the different wake words in case you have multiples. I haven't used them with any smart home features yet, but just as a helpful hand in the morning with news, traffic, and weather. I primarily use it for music at night and it has been great. In addition there are a lot of different things to discover but they give you a little cheat sheet with some of the phrases to try. The speaker is of great quality too and is pretty powerful at max volume. I have only begun to scratch the surface of the echo's potential and absolutely love it already.
