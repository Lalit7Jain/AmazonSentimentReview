I was not sure how we would use this product.  BUT I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! I use it to stream music, my books through audible and to maintain my shopping list.  It is so awesome to say "Alexa add eggs to the shopping list" and it show up on my shopping list via the Alexa app.  We have found a lot of fun features to enable.  My daughters favorite is the magic door.  I like the jeopardy game and twenty questions.  This has turned into a really awesome addition to our home.  I look forward to future updates and seeing the new ways we will use this product.
