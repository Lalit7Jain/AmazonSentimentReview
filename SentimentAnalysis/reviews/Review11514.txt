Alexa on the Echo is great when it works but that's only about half the time. It does well with playlists created by Amazon but not so well with playlists created by the user. I named a playlist 'George'. Alexa played me songs by various guys named George but couldn't find my list. And so forth. It is great fun to sing out the name of a song and have the device play it for you. It is less fun  when the device tells you it is not in your library. You find yourself arguing with a device. No doubt there is a lot of that in our future. This gadget is definitely worth the price but be prepared for a little frustration.
