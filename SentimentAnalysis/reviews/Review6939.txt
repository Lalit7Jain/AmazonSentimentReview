My family and I LOVE our new Echo!! The setup was quick and easy.  The kids love asking Alexia jokes, weather and sports info. I enjoy asking for random music and news information. This is the perfect addition to our kitchen area. My kids ask Alexa for the following day's forecast to know how to dress for school the next day. We loved it so much that we ordered the Dot for our bedroom.
