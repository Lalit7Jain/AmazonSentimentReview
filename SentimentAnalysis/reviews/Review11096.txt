We love our amazon echo, she is amazing.  She play Madonna for me & I danced after being in the intensive care for 16 days in a transplant hospital.  The echo plays any music you ask for.  She makes a list of your appointments, tells the weather forecast, keep your food buying list & many more skill apts.  I wish that I could buy one for everyone I know as Christmas gifts & I have a long list of family that shall receive This awesome device.  Thank you,
