I purchased over the past year or so several WeMo controllers and the Echo integrates flawlessly. I have also integrated a few smart bulbs, my garage door opener, thermostat, and even my camera controlled Kuna lights with minimal work. I have read some articles about APIs and 3rd party people writing code to integrate other smart devices so I'm interested in researching that more (I will update this review once I learn more)
