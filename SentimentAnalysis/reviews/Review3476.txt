This echo has never worked correctly from day one and there is no one you can call at Amazon to get help with it. I continuously drops the network connection which requires a 10 minute procedure to reconnect then it works for a day if your lucky. I purchased a Dot and it works well. I guess I got a bad unit which wouldn't be bad if I could get someone to reply to my attempts to get help or replacement.
