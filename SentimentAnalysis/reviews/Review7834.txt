At 71 years old and not the most tech savey, we like the limited functions of the Echo.  But we cannot use Alexa to the most functions, as we see it advertised.  We went ahead and signed up for Prime on a 30 day trial, and I think an annual subscription.  We have not received a receipt for the annual subscription.  As seen on u-tube we see some people that out 2 pieces of instructions from the original box.  WE DIDN'T have those 2 in our package.  We don't know know how to sync our wifi to the Echo.  I have the app on my cell phone and the wife has it on her tablet.  But we still don't understand how to sinc the two together.  We would like to hear music use the other capabilities.  Giving the echo 3 stars is stretching it.
