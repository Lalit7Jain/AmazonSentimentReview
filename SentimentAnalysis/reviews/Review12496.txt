incredible how inconsistent the voice recognition is.  I can say "turn to WEEI" and it will sometimes give me the double sound meaning it's doing nothing.  Sometimes it says "now tuning to America's choice."  Other times it says "now tuning to WEEI on tunein radio."  I never know.  Same exact thing with my other Boston sports station.  Constantly drops the wifi signal (I use wifi when watching Apple TV and Roku so it's not the wifi connection.  In my house, this is a worthless joke of $139.00.
