Still getting used to it.  Have some smart switches set up to it as well as some music accounts and my starbucks account.  Still feel like there are inroads to be made with their partners, ie. Starbucks app needs more flexibility in making and adjusting orders, but it's a great start.  The smart switches have been spotty, but that's on Wemo, not Alexa.  Alexa still gets the command properly whenever the Wemi switches are in working order.  Alexa hears my voice prettt well whether I'm in the kitchen or living room.
