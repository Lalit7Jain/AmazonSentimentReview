In my opinion, if you have Prime, Alexa is a great way to go. If you don't, Google Home is the way to go. By the way, both sound great to me music wise. I have a one bedroom condo and they both go way, way louder with clarity than I will ever play music. I really can't recommend one over the other for sound quality. Both are great, both are improving every day, and you'll be thrilled with either. I realize this probably won't help anyone on the fence decide which to buy, but if the only one you are deciding whether or not to buy, buy her!! You will love it.
