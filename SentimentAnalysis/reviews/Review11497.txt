Pretty cool.  Does a great job at accepting regular casual speech as commands.  No need to memorize specific command syntax.  Directly controls my smart light bulbs.  Can play Pandora at request and can even discern the station name I ask for.  Can also directly play a song title by name, I think thru amazon prime music?  Nice when I want to hear a specific song and don't want to look it up on youtube or something.  Also, a little personal favorite, "Alexa, play rain sounds."
