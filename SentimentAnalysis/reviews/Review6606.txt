The device is great but Amazon Music is unbelievably horrible. Supposedly you can upload your current music via the Amazon Music app, but trying to do anything with the app is an incredibly frustrating experience. I just spent over an hour trying to get a set of 16 tracks to upload and added to a playlist only to finally give up. Some tracks were missing, others were uploaded more than once, and others uploaded but couldn't be added to the playlist for no obvious reason. AVOID AMAZON MUSIC AT ALL COSTS BECAUSE IT IS HORRIBLE and don't buy an Echo if you are counting on uploading music to it.
