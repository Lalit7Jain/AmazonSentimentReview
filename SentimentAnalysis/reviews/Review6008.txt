it's ok as a music player but that seems to be about it unless you have special lights installed in your house or other smart devices that work along with it.  she is pretty dumb though when you ask her questions.  i get a lot of "i can't really comment on that" responses when asking her questions.  Also, she is pretty dumb about finding music.  I have had several instances so far (only had it a week) where she can't find a song that I am looking right at on my amazon music app.  not super impressed so far.  i really hope they work on the internet searching capabilities.  she doesn't seem to know a lot about anything.
