Seriously, I don't get it.  Why is this thing such a hot selling item?  I received my Echo as a Christmas gift and I'm still trying to figure out what USEFUL things it does.  It does not communicate with my iPhone/iPad (with very limited exception) so it won't send texts or initiate a call.  And if you use iTunes, forget it, Echo won't play it.  I'm a Prime member but I don't use AmazonMusic, Pandora, iHeartRadio, etc.  However, I do use Spotify, which is one of Echo's so-called skills.  My home is wired with Sonos for a wonderful sound around the house. However, Echo does not work with Sonos so if I'm playing from Spotify I have to use either my Sonos speakers or the one Echo.  Sorry Echo, but your sound quality may be good but it can't compete with Sonos.  And if you want to use Echo to play Spotify, it tells you to log into to App first to connect.  If I have to do that, why do I need Echo, I'll just connect to my Sonos.
