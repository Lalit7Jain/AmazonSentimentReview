My parents are 95 & 96 and have the predictable challenges of aging.  In particular, my mother has macular degeneration and can't read anymore.  Enter the Echo which we recently purchased so she could have voice access to basic internet information sources.  She greatly enjoyed each day asking the Echo to read the news or tell her a joke, ask about the weather, sports results or answer questions about well, almost anything.  Meanwhile, to continue her voracious reading, she was fumbling with tapes and CDs from the Library of Congress or her local library most of which had to be played on special devices each of which had its own array of buttons.
