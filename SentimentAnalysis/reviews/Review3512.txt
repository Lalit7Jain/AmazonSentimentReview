Really bad at answering questions that are easy to find answers for on the web.  I checked and Hey Google was able to answer all the questions Alexa couldn't (e.gt., Why did Simon and Garfunkel break up?  What song was on the top of the Billboard charts in 1995? etc).  At this point mainly using it as a very expensive egg timer.
