I put off buying this because it usually turns out to be a hassle to learn how to use a high-tech product.  But thing is SO EASY to set up and use that I regret waiting so long.  I use it for listening to radio programs, getting spelling and definitions for words, and almost every morning I get the weather.  I haven't set up music lists or such yet but I know they are available.  For now, I just ask for specific songs.  A side benefit is getting a song which is stuck in your head because you have forgotten part of the lyrics.  The headline could have been "End your earbugs!"
