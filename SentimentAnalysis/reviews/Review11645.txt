My only issues (and the reason for 4 starts instead of 5) are: 1) Alexa doesn't hear me very well when music is playing. It was a lot better when I first got my Echo in July. Now I often have to get right up to the Echo and say the wake word. It's a bit frustrating. I hope they fix this with an update soon. 2) I don't understand why the app and the spoken commands only allow you to set the volume from 1-10 (10 steps) while the volume controls on the Echo itself has something like 30 steps. Sometimes volume 4 is too soft while volume 5 is too loud, which isn't the case when you have the 30 steps that are physically available on the unit. This just seems like an odd discrepancy
