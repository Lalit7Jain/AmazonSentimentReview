No stars. It worked great until March 13. It started getting really choppy with Amazon streaming music playback.  I thought maybe it was having a bad day, or my internet was. Pandora streamed fine, movies streamed fine on my smart tv. The next day it still sucked. I went to return it. Turns out the last day it was eligible for returns was March 12. The day after it's eligible to be returned, performance degrades so it is useless to stream music, which is 90% of the reason I got it. Boo Amazon. Seriously, boo.
