I really loved my Echo (I have a dot, too) but it only has a one year warranty, after which Amazon doesn't do anything to repair or replace, just offers a $20 discount on a new one. Mine developed a problem with the microphone -- at least that's what I think. Tech support was surprisingly unhelpful.
