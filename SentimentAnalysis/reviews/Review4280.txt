For me the speaker is terrible with poor bass. Of course it's all relative though. I mainly listen to music with an Echo Dot connected to Bose SoundTouch 30 so obviously the Echo doesn't compare well to a $500 speaker. If you're in an apartment and can't play music very loud anyway I think the Echo will be fine. I'm keeping it to use on my patio where I can't play music too loud without disturbing my neighbors. If it's in your budget I recommend getting an Echo Dot along with a Bose SoundTouch 30 or SoundTouch 20 (the SoundTouch 10 isn't that great).
