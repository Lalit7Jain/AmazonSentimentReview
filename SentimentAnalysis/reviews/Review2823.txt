I love it. I use it all the time for my music. I use it as a timer because it's all hands free. I haven't  explored a whole lot of it. I can't wait to see it integrate with Amazon movies. I love the list you can make. It is easy to talk to Alexa. Get the weather report and traffic. Came as expected easy to use. Would highly recommend.
