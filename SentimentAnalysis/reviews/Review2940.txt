We LOVE Alexa! This Echo is responsive when called upon. I work from home and often need to convert measurements from metric to inches, or fractions to decimals while I'm writing. "She" is always at the ready to jump in and do the math for me on the fly. Alexa will stream my favorite music, or ocean wave sounds if I need to concentrate, look up definitions, even read a recipe to me. So many uses.
