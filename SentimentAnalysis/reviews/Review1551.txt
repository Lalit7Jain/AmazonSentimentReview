I have used this peice of tech now for a little over six months. I did not have much expectation and I really tried to take the time to give it plenty of chances to live up to it's own hype..which it doesn't. This product is a toy, and I realize that. I could forgive it if it just occasionally missed a command or went out but the problems have been consistent and nothing seems to be a permanent solution.
