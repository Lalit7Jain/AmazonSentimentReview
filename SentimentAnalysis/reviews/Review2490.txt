This is for old people or for people that don't understand technology in general. I was wondering what this could do that Siri or my iPhone couldn't. The answer is nothing. It's a waste of time and money. Someone like my dad would be impressed with this... maybe... I'll actually re-gift it to him. If you have an iPhone and a speaker dock- don't bother cause this is the same thing but a huge downgrade as Siri is much better. I am an Amazon Prime member and spend several thousands of dollars a year on Amazon. I almost never leave reviews but I had to on this one.
