This is fun a lot of the time but there are DEFINITELY BETTER PRODUCTS out there. I would say for a multi billion dollar organization and with things like Google and Siri this definitely dropped the ball. When searching for podcasts or even songs most of the time it will take you to a song that you didn't even ask about and forget about asking about podcasts it will just tune you in to something you don't like.... If you thumbs down a song or an artist on the echo or tap you think they would stop playing that artist? I hate drake and I thumbs down every one of his songs,  (Alexa, play a station I might like) Here's a station you might like. Drake.. Yeah good job amazon.
