I've been looking at this product for a while. I finally decided to pull the trigger over "cyber weekend," and I couldn't be more pleased with my decision. The packaging came very neatly, the setup was painless and took a few minutes. Alexa recognizes when I'm trying to get her attention, responds to voice commands flawlessly, and the speaker is very good quality. I haven't yet used her to her maximum potential, but I'm very happy with my purchase. If you're on the fence about this like I was, do yourself a favor and buy it.
