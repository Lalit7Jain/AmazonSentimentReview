We love our Amazon Echo.  I especially love being able to listen to no commercial music!  We recently added iHome plugs and now Alexa can turn on and off lights in our home.  The app also allows us to turn them on and off when we are away from home.  We added our security system on as well.  Several of our friends have bought one because ours has been so much fun and entertainment.  One thing I do wish, is that it  could be more current with sports scores, etc.  I love the shopping list feature!  Sometimes it is not convenient to be near pad and paper to write it down.  I open the app at the store and there is my list!
