My Echo worked for several weeks before it was unable to play music or perform basic funcions. I then went through the list of recommendations and tried each one. I had two nice conversations with associates who provided solutions that did not work, and was then told that something may have happened with the port that the Echo required to connect to wifi. I spent quite some time calling and emailing my provider and was told that they, nor I, could open ports without significant risk. I then called Amazon back, asking for a refund and was told that, since I'd owned the stupid thing for over thirty days, my refund would be discounted. In the meantime, a friend who had issues with an Echo purchased at Bed, Bath and Beyond was able to return their device for a full refund.
