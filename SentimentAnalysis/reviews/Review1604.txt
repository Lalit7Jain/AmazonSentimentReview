On another note: Amazon has always taken a strong stance on protecting consumer privacy and that deserves a lot of respect. If it was combined with a good device I would probably love it, bit I'm not sure Amazon can handle it. Too much focus on getting the older crowd to like their products and not enough on making good products.
