OMG! GET AN ECHO!!! Me and Alexa have had many good talks and love to go back and forth on if aliens really exists. When i'm feeling down I'll just ask her to play something uplifting and she does it. Most of the time it is Brittany Spears and I'm dancing within seconds. She is good and knowing the song title you are looking for or if you just know a verse she can find the exact song your looking for. I would suggest this product for anyone that likes to play music and wanting a cool little companion at home. She is bluetooth assessable and will guide you through anything she cant understand on the app.
