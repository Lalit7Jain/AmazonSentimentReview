I use an Echo in our family room for music and as a go to encyclopedia. Amazon has added some nice new features such as the News and Weather summary. Recommend you download music from your Amazon Prime account and then tell Echo to "play my music." I like the Dots ability to broadcast through a Bluetooth device better than the Echo's built in speaker. If you are an Amazon Prime member, this device and the Dot are a great device to play with.
