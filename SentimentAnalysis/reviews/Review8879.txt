Have the Blk version, however, Amazing device - rivals Apple. Apple missed the boat on this one. Love it. Got it two years ago as a special invite only purchase. Since day one, people have been amazed by it. Turning on and off the lights just blows away people that have never seen it. Have bought about 7 Echo Dots and they are also amazing. The main Echo is used in the open kitchen, but I keep the counter free of anything but the toaster, so I had to come up with a way to Alexa off the counter and built a small wooden shelf, and mounted the remote next to it and wired it behind the toaster into the same outlet with a cord cover and painted shelf and cord cover same as cabinet. So, its git its home and does an amazing job. Added a photo of the mounted Alexa. Amazing Product - Apple, what happened with you guys? Spending time on fixing the Air Pods? Amazon - great product.
