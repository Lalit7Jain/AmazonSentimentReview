Bought this as a Christmas present for my son, he is really into anything voice activated.  We opened it in the morning and then headed out to his grandparent's house for dinner and more presents.  When we finally got home, I was exhausted and he wanted the Echo set up.  I was not looking forward to it and was trying to find any excuse to not do it.  Finally, I got the directions, downloaded the app and the Echo basically set it self up! It was amazingly simple...this was the easiest technology related item I have ever had to activate! Less than 5 minutes and we are using it!  The only reason I took off a star is because we ask Alexa things that are very easy to find on the internet and she can't locate the information.  Simple things such as word definitions and she comes back blank.  So far, it's nice for weather and news updates, easy to play music and she has some decent jokes...not sure how long the fascination will last.
