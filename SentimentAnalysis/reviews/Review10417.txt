Okay so, I wanted to love this I really did. Out of the box it is a beautiful device that seemed to work very well. Now though there are so many issues. The volume wheel doesn't spin properly. Alexa answers me, but doesn't follow through with a response or a command. It's frustrating. I payed good money to have this work properly in my home, but I would say before buying explore your options because there are definitely better speakers out there and now that Google Home is out, that is worth a look!
