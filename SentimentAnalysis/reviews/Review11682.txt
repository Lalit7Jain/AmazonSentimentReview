I love this device!! When I bought it I really didn't need it but once I got it I realized how much fun it is. I have everything connected to it, lights, music, even my bank account. It is the best way to get the latest news, weather, and things I need. I bought a stand for it which is really recommended since it can crack if it falls. For  $179. it is the best way to get connected.
