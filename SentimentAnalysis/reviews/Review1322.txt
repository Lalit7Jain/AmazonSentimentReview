When you take the lighting and heating controls out of the equation, it's basically a hands free version of Siri.  Does that justify the cost?  Probably not, but it's a neat gizmo.  I use the device primarily for the timer feature when cooking in the kitchen.  I also like how she'll play Pandora, provide the weather.
