I didn't realize what I was buying when I bought it. I just wanted a Bluetooth speaker, but it's WAY more! Alexa is almost like having an assistant in my kitchen! I can look up over temperature million songs with my amazon music. I just ask and it plays. This thing is great.One note: you have to keep this item plugged in or purchase the base for portability at almost $50.00.
