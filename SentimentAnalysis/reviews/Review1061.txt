Unless you have an iPhone, I don't suggest buying an Echo. The Echo works fine, but you need the Alexa app in order to set it up which only seems to work on older phones (that aren't made by Samsung) or an iPhone (which still runs painfully slow if at all). If you were thinking that it would work on the Kindle Fire since it is an Amazon product, it doesn't. So until they fix the app, your Echo is an expensive paperweight.
