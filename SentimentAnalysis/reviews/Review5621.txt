While the speaker quality certainly is nice, many requests made are answered by alexa with a "I don't know the answer to the question."  Extremely frustrating at times and end up using my phone through the app 90% of the time just so I stop yelling at the device like a crazy person.  Thinking I should have just got a Google home instead.
