my wife and I are in our late seventies and early eighties and we are not super knowledgeable with all these new fangled electronics, but we have been able to work our way through this and learned to do some of the basics and have had one contact with customer service in the original setup that went extremely well.  We just look to doing more with Alexa in the future.
