I know I've only scratched the surface of the skills available for Amazon Echo. Very easy to set up and covers most of my downstairs area. Currently I use it to control lighting, updates on weather, news, music and podcasts. The beauty of this device is its ability to develop and update and not become obsolete in the near future.
