Echo stopped working about a month ago. I have contacted Amazon over this issue and have not received a reply. After reading the reviews I see there are many people having trouble with the power cord. I tried unplugging the Echo for 15 seconds, held the reset button on the bottom for 15 seconds yet nothing works. Seems there is a problem with the power cord. Why is it so hard to communicate with Amazon through their website? they keep the "contact us" link hidden from the public. I have looked everywhere and see nothing for live support or a phone number. WTF?
