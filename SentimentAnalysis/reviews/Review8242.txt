I would give Echo 5 stars but Alexa keep disappearing on me.  Each morning, I am like "Alexa, what is the weather"  or "Alexa play some music" , "Alexa, where are you?" with no response.  I look around and she is nowhere to be found?  I have to then get off my couch and wonder where she is.  Each morning after brief hunts I usually find Echo in one of my children's rooms.  I then grab Echo and place it where it belongs on my kitchen counter where we spend some of the day together.  I just wish it was not so mobile as to linger around my house especially ending up upstairs in my children's rooms.  Other than that, good sound, kinda fun.
