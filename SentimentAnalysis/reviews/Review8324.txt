I was gifted an Echo a year ago, and honestly its one of the greatest things ever.  In addition to the hundreds of practical uses, Alexa is also loaded with Easter eggs (Try "Alexa, Open the pod bay doors", "Alexa, Whats the average airspeed velocity of a swallow?", "Alexa, How many licks does it take to get to the tootsie-roll center of a tootsie-pop?", "Alexa, Valar Morghulis", "Alexa, What's the first rule of Fight Club?")
