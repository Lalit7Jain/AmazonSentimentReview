Of course, she can control smart outlets and stuff like that, but the feature I use most often is asking her to add stuff to my shopping list. I can call out to her as I cook or clean so as soon as I know we're low in something, so does she. I can access that list from the app, so no more forgetting that I need something when I'm at the store. If my partner remembers something we need while I'm at the store, he can tell Alexa and it updates my list. I just check the list one last time before I check out. It seems like such a simple thing, but for me, it's been so useful.
