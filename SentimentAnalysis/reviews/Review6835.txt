Much Much Louder higher sound quality then the Dot puts out.  Have in the Kitchen which is next to the Living Room so we can use it for Music etc easily. At its loudest setting it has a hard time telling your trying to get it to do something.  But at its highest its a bit excessive anyhow.  If you need something that loud or louder they make Amplifiers and speakers for that...
