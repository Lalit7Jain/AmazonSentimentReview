I have had the Echo for about 3 months now, and I use it literally everyday! It is very convenient for someone constantly on the go, especially when used to check the weather or listening to the news while doing a million other things in between. The voice recognition is spot on, and Alexa picks up about 95% of what I'm saying. The Amazon Music and Audible features work flawlessly, and the audio is very crisp and clear. Even after having it for so long, I am still exploring all that this thing can do!
