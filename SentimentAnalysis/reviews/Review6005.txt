Cute device; got it as a gift from my kid. Alexa won't play my itunes library unless I upload it all to Amazon Music (for a fee) or pair it with my iPad or iPhone. Everything else Echo/Alexa does I could already do with Siri on my iPhone or iPad. What a crock! This is nothing more than an expensive bluetooth speaker.
