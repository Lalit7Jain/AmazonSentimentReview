I use the Echo mostly for playing music. It's a rather expensive toy with a unique skill. It's not great though. I find it exceedingly frustrating when if I have the music playing loudly and ask Alexa to turn down the volume it often does not hear me. I also find it frustrating when I ask Alexa to add something to my shopping list, which she does, but if I say "add onions, sugar and eggs" or something similar she will only add one item onto the list so I must repeat the command several times. I'm not impressed with the knowledge base either. Google Play has the world wide web to pull information from yet Alexa uses Wikipedia and not well, plus you have to be specific with your request or question or you get the pat answer that she doesn't understand the question. Basically I think it's cool, but it's just another gadget that really doesn't do all that much. I would not buy it a second time.
