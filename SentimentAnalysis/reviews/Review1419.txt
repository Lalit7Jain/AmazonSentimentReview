My family uses Alexa every single day. The kids love to interact with "her", and they love all the corny jokes she tells. I use it to get updates on the daily news, get a quick check of the weather, and to set timers for cooking and the kids homework. We also love the music stations, and the ability to listen to my favorite talk radio stations and sports. This has been one of my better purchases over the last several years. I would recommend it to anyone!!
