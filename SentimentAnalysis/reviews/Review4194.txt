My Echo has been amazing for several months. However, I don't know if it was a new update, but when I tell Alexa to play my favorite bands/songs, my Echo just started to throw out random song names. For example, I just said "Alexa, play album Deja Entendu by Brand New." Very well known album, and I've played it many times before. Yet I get a response like "Here is 'Sweet Child of Mine,' by Guns N' Roses."
