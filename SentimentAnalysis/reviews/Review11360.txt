It has kept us better organized with our shopping lists, kept us on track with our daily schedule, let us know whether the kids need jackets in the morning with the weather report, taught my daughter a ton of awful "dad jokes," helped me when I'm cooking and clueless about how many teaspoons are in a tablespoon, etc... It's infinitely helpful and we are crazy about "Alexa."
