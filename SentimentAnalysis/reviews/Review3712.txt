Alexa, can answer very general questions, but many simple every day questions or specific ethnic questions are not answered.  Maybe it should be programed to look at Black History and the common interest of the general public.  Maybe a website could be created or an app that will allow Alexa to update/research a question and add it to her memory bank or post it on the web.  But to just say  "Hum, I'm not sure how to answer that question"  gets old pretty fast.
