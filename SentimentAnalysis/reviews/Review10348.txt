I love the Echo and the Alexa app which is the voice for the Echo.  I have had the Echo since August 2016.  I learn new features about it every day.  I find the Echo useful for weather updates, news,  to spell words, to read my books or to play my Audible books for me when I'm busy.  I can create reminders for taking pills or appointments.  I can tell the Echo to add items to my  shopping list which I can carry with me on my phone or print it out if I prefer.  I also can create a to-do list.
