I love this speaker as a product. I got introduced to this product by a friend and was very intrigued because of the multi use of it (A bluetooth speaker, voice commands, timer, etc.) Although the sound itself isn't the best (other speakers are better) I definitely think that the sound is good and I don't really have complaints on that. My only complaint and warning to future buyers is that I wanted to use Spotify through my speaker but you have to have Spotify premium in order to use it through the speaker. I did not see this any where on the description or anything, and only found out when I was setting it up. I thought I was gonna have to return it but luckily I was already thinking of getting premium and decided now was time. But they didn't make that clear, and it was very frustrating. Other than that I am very happy I purchased it and I like it even more because I got it on sale!
