Honestly, this is a high price for music. Yes, she does math and the alarm is a good feature. However, I ask for the weather and get another city, you ask questions and get "Hmmm...I can't understand the question". I get that a lot. Google is a better choice and it is free. Don't pay the exorbitant price for a radio.
