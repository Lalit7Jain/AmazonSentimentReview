Expected something more like the Google app on my phone. It's very rare that Google doesn't provide a valid answer to anything I ask. Thought this would be more like that. I guess I need to be more educated on what to do with it. For the most part it has only been helpful telling me the weather. And I can get that info from my phone. Was going to return both it and the Echo dot I purchased, but am 1 day too late; 1/31/2017 apparently was the last day I could return the items. Oh well, my bad for not keeping track.
