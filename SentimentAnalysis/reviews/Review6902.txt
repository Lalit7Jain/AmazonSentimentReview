I would give a 5 star rating but... some of the questions I ask that are denied an answer (i.e 'I'm sorry, I cannot find the answer') are easily and obviously the top search result on Bing (and other search engines, you know... that little box at the top of the search engine's results page that will readily speak the result if you voice search because of its high confidence). For example I asked Alexa what Bill Cosby's net worth is and Alexa says it doesn't know and in my Alexa phone app it directs me to the Bing search results... and right at the top of the page in that special box in large bold letters is the dollar amount. I don't understand why it doesn't relay that or other very easily obtainable, "top of the search page information box" information. On a side note (this doesn't affect my rating because I knew this before buying) it would also be nice if it had WiFi calling and texting.
