After few days, the hype sort of fades away. It seemed like this product is more in to doing marketing for amazon then doing anything else. I am a hotel owner and there are bunch of reminders I have to use everyday to keep me at the top. My whole goal before purchasing was that I can say "Alexa remind me to check bulb in room 227 in 30 minutes". To my surprise Alexa will not create a remind just by listing to that sentence. It will ask "What time"?. Well, what does "in 30 minutes" supposed to mean?
