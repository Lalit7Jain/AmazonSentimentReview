So today is my birthday. My husband bought me the echo as a gift. We live in the Caribbean. I have been a Prime member for years now, paying $100.00 every year and shopping constantly on Amazon. If you're buying the Echo to listen to music because you think that your paying the Prime Fees gives you access to it - BE WARNED. You are wasting your money! Prime does not provide music to Prime members outside the US making the Amazon ECHO a useless piece of plastic for users like us. It does not pair with iTunes... unless you route it through some other device (which is pointless if I already have another device to play my iTunes. Location infor and weather deets don't work outside the U.S. either (but let's be honest - no one pays $179.00 to be told the weather and time). In truth, it feels like a bit of a scam that this device is being sold to non-US Amazon Shoppers when it OBVIOUSLY cannot fulfil most of it's purpose outside the US. I am so angry about it that I think I will be cancelling my Prime Account too. I guess Happy Birthday to me. And my husband feels so disappointed that this thing ruined his birthday gift.
