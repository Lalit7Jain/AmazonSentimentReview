I really like the Amazon Echo but there are some bugs that keep me from "loving" it.  First, the sound and convenience are excellent.  It has renewed my love of music and makes doing chores and exercise much more pleasant. I do recommend this device without reservation.  That said, when I stream music, songs spontaneously skip or restart for some odd reason.  Secondly, when I play from my Spotify playlist Alexa always starts with the same song--it doesn't reshuffle.  I do have faith that Amazon will continue to improve the product and resolve these issues.
