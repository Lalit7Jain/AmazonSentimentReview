This product is nothing short of amazing!!!!  I thought it would be a novelty, but I'm finding I'm getting a lot of everyday use out of it.  My son loves Elvis and with my Amazon Prime selections there is plenty of Elvis songs for him to listen to.  I use it for quick weather reports and I get my flash news updates before I head out the door in the morning.  Alexa is a great help around the kitchen too.  I can have her set multiple cooking timers to alert me when things are ready to come out of the oven and she does conversions for me too. (cups in a pint, etc.)  The voice recognition is nothing short of amazing and I expected a long delay in processing voice commands, but its very short and almost like talking to a real person.  Very impressed.  It's really refreshing to have a hands free tool like the Echo to help you out.  I would highly recommend this product.
