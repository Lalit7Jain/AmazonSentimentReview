We're super pleased with our Amazon Echo. We use it daily for news, weather, controlling our lights with wifi plugs, checking our schedules, setting timers, asking for conversions, and listening to music through Spotify Connect. The voice recognition is better than Siri or Google. We use Alexa so much that we bought a Dot for another room.
