How did we function without the echo. I learned the hard way (make sure you turn off ordering from the echo) *if you have children. A drone through Amazon magically appeared on our doorstep due to young boys asking Alexa to ship a drone. :) I love all the music Alexa plays and being able to ask anything when it pops in my head. "Does Chuck Norris know karate?" "What is the score of the __ basketball game" "What is the time/weather is also helpful with young children while scurrying through the house. We love it and some relatives will be receiving Alexa as a gift. I agree with other posters of having two if you have two stories. We rely on Alexa random info through the day and it would be helpful on the other floor. It sounds crazy and and indulgent but Alexa will soon feel like a family member.
