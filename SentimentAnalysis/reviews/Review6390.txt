My two personal favorite skills are Jeopardy and the Magic Door. Everyone knows Jeopardy but Magic Door is an interactive story where you tell Alexa where you want to go and what you want to do and those choices will ultimately alter the story line. Pretty cool especially if you remember those Goosebump books from the 90s.
