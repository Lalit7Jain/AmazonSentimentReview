We love Alexa. We are constantly asking her to play something, remember something, time something, learn new tasks. Right now she is a fun toy, but I am relying on her more and more everyday. They more I use her, the I learn what she has to offer. I love the ability to use the timers in the kitchen. May not sound like much, but when I need 3 timers set, she can do it. I love that! I love the music app, as I am cooking she will keep me company. Look up recipes, do conversions, determine substitutions all by voice. That is fantastic when you have your hands full of flour.
