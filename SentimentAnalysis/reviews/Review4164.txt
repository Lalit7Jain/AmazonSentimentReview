My Echo is great--when it works.  It works just fine for a few days, and then it won't work at all.  It will not answer me.  The lights will turn on when I call it, but then they will shut off without it answering me.  The first time it happened, I unplugged it for awhile and then restarted it, and that worked, but now it stopped working again.  I bought it only about a month or so ago.
