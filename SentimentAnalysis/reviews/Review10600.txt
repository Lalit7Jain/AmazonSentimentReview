This is truly one of the best purchases I've ever made.  I started building up a smart home because of the novelty and excitement, but as that started to wear off, I was feeling a bit fatigued by the entire action of opening up a phone app, flipping to the right device, and turning on a control.  Often, this would have be simpler to do manually.  Alexa gave me full control over my smart home from the living room without touching my phone.
