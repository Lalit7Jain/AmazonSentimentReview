What can I say except I love my Alexa, easy to set up, the features are amazing, Just say Alexa do what ever and if it has been enabled in the settings she will do it. Big PLUS she can find my audio books it not her voice that reads the book but all I have to say Alexa audio book and the one I have been listening to or reading she picks right up. I actually purchased two of the dots one for my bedroom and the other for the bathroom where I can sit in the tub and listen to the bible, music. The possibilities are endless.
