This is a unique product. I really have enjoyed using it. At first I wasn't sure what I would use it for, but over time I have found many uses and ways to enjoy it. I'm still learning!  I am able to interact with items I didn't think I could interact with at first. Plus programming allows for variety as well. I now have this and several Dots. Technology can be amazing!
