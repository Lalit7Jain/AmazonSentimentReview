We didn't expect that Alexa would be such a major enabler of our daily life. I ask her to set a timer when the water is poured into the French Press for our morning coffee. I ask her to play something nice to listen to in the morning. Often, Alexa plays music from 8 AM until midnight. Sometimes it is to listen to full albums (revisiting the Beatles has been fun!), or a favorite Pandora station (it took a bit for Alexa to understand my request for the "Tomasz Stanko station" - but now she gets it!). Right now I am listening to the Boston Bruins on Tune in. My wife and I love the daily news brief - a dose of NPR, BBC, local, NY Times, and Slate.  We ask for and get a seven day weather forecast.
