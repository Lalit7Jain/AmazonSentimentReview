The Amazon Echo is well built and has a quality feel to it. Unfortunately, it does not add to my life. Everything it does I can already do with technology I currently own, like my phone or tablet. Voice activation is the only different thing it brings, but as someone who is able-bodied, this doesn't hold the value it might for someone who is physically challenged. While the Amazon Echo is not a bad product, at $140+ it is not worth it for me.
