PROS: - I recently discovered the Sound and Relaxation skill and it is definitely one of the best sleep apps out there. They have a huge list of sounds to pick from, from lake and ocean to brown or white noises to forest etc. A must-have for those of you who suffer from Insomnia like me. You'll sleep like a baby. I promise.
