I bought this as a gift for my wife and she loves it. She uses it for weather updates, music and various questions that the kids have. My daughter likes Alexa to tell jokes and the Simon says feature. For some reason this device just doesn't work with my voice. I have to repeat myself 5 times and usually get a response to some different question. If I ask for the weather in New York I get the weather for New Mexico. I don't have any type of accent or speech impediment for reference. My wife and kids don't seem to have the same problem so I guess it's just me but I have no idea why. My wife was so happy with it that she wanted the Echo Dot for a different room. I'm glad that everyone else likes the Echo and is able to get a lot of use out of it but Alexa and I just don't get along.
