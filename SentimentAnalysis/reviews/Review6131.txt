I LOVE my Echo.  I gave it a 4 though so people will notice that it doesn't work with iTunes - you can't ask it to play songs from your iTunes library.  I'm guessing that's an issue on the Apple side but still disappointing.  I do use Spotify for music I buy and it does work with Spotify which is great.  The speaker quality is great for the size of this!  I haven't even figured out all it can do - but out of the box it's easy to get working and playing music and answering questions,  telling jokes.....  A great "toy"  which is a very useful device
