I received this as a Christmas present from my husband who let me open it early because he knew I would get some use out of it.  The Echo is amazing!  Alexa has become a very handy tool this past week while I make my holiday goodies for friends and family!  I have linked my Pandora and Spotify accounts to it and am constantly playing music on it.  Best gift I have ever received!
