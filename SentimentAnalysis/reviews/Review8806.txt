A little more maturation is needed. It can't detect some iris devices. It also is only able to link to a single calendar. So either me or my wife must go without our calendar. No remote mics so either carry the voice remote or move the device to the room you occupy. Does not connect to anything external such as speakers or your computer for questions regarding files and such. More expensive than the dot, less functionality. Even the dot Payton lyrics to a single device, so if you want music in the shower and then the bedroom have two of everything or take it and speaker with you.
