This is the second of two I have purchased. The first I placed in my home and have had no problems. I took this one over to my elderly father, downloaded the app on my iPad and completed the linkup process. It works flawlessly for one day and then I have to link it up again. I therefore can only give this echo two stars. If I can get it to work more than 1 day at a time I will update my rating.
