But that's about all I use it for.  I don't find the "skills" to be all that useful. The only other thing I could really use it for is the home automation stuff that I'm not ready to invest in. If there was some way to control or integrate with the Fire TV or Stick, that would be nice. I also wish it could act as a speakerphone just by Bluetooth pairing.
