I absolutely love my Amazon Alexa. She's not perfect, but if you take the time to learn how to say the commands and you take the time to learn everything that she can do and you take the time to learn everything that you can sync it up with. I think that you were really enjoy this product we just enjoy setting it up to our Phillips lights. It's great.
