The Echo/Alexa can hear and understand me when I call out to her from another room, too, even when the Echo is playing NPR or some music, as long as I don't have the volume turned up too loud (over volume 7 and she has problems). For times when Alexa cannot hear me there's a button I can press that will mute the music and allow me to give her instructions, as well as a rotating volume control ring around the top of the unit..
