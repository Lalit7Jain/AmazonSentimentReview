BEWARE! My Echo worked as advertised for a little over a year but a Blue Spinning Ring of death that has been reported online in various forums which resulted from failed or faulty software/firmware update appeared late last night. I was told the Echo was out of the warranty period that would have naturally covered the hardware itself, but as this is likely the result of a software issue, ie an Amazon issue, then I definitely should have been offered a replacement. Instead, no explanation as to the cause of the malfunction, and only an offer to purchase another or a refurbished Echo at around $120. Not interested when I have 2 Dots already. Time to consider other options such as Google Home. Now off to wait for the other two to fail.
