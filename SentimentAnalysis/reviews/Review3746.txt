Constantly wrong with my requests, 7 microphones of crap. I have done the voice training a dozen times, still crap. I live in Chicago Illinois, not Chicago eel? The news reports are vague, often saying things like "a small boy" and nothing more? WTF is that? The speaker is weak. It can differentiate between "counter lights" and "counter light" but can't say sound tribe? Often it just plays Justin Bieber when it can't understand me, no joke. I've never uttered the words Justin or Bieber in my house. Needs so much work <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008E>
