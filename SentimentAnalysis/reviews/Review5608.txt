I decided to look up my warranty (one year limited) and realized that I wasn’t covered (I purchased one of the first units 2 years ago).  So I decided to just purchase a replacement power adapter from Amazon and of course now Alexa is chatting away as before.  BTW, there are several 3rd party power adapters available besides the Amazon branded one for less money and they all seem to work.  And if you are not in a hurry for a replacement power adapter, you can purchase a 3rd party one for much less at your favorite online auction site.  Why not get a spare or three and make it easier to move the Echo/Alexa from room to room?
