While I do LOVE amazon and have been a religious user and frequent shopper on here, I have to admit that I've come to expect amazon developed products to be lacking. For the most part, they get the job done, but usually neglect major details here and there that dull down the potential for maximum customer satisfaction. That being said, I do think this echo is one of their better items. However, my echo was gifted off my wishlist, and if I had to choose between echo and google home, I'd pick google without a second thought, because I trust their brand to deliver while I have doubts with amazon.
