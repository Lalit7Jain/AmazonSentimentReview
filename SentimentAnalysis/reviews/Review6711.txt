What makes this even better is the $79 Unlimited  music plan for a year or just a few dollars a month for the Echo alone. All I have to say is "Alexa, Play Side to Side by Ariana Grande and it plays it no problem. So f****** easy!!! I'm already spoiled Amazon, thanks! Bottom line is I love my Echo!!!
