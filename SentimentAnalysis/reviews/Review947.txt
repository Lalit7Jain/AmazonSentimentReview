Had some issues with Amazon music being linked to another account, as a couple of calls to amazon they finally figured out what was going on and gotten the issue corrected. Love the Echo other then the government having another item to listen to your conversations lol. But yes this is a great product, it listens very well and can hear you from across the house.
