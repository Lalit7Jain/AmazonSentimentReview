arrived on time.  easy to set up.  easy to use.  recognition is not a problem. sounds great.  There are a lot of "skills" to choose from and there seem to be so many not sure what I am missing (if anything).  Only concern is Privacy.  The unit "listens" all the time for a command. From what I have read it only stores the commands but ???
