So far... NOT so good.  Received my first Echo, and it would not respond consistently to the "Alexa" wake up command (most times it would not respond at all even when yelling at it from just a few inches away).  Had to package up, send back, and after a week received what I believe is a refurbished one... WITH NO POWER ADAPTER.  Contacted Amazon, they credited me for the price of the adapter, had to order a new one.
