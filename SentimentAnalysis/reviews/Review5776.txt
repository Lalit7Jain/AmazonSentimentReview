So I've had my Echo for a couple months now and I have to say I'm a little disappointed... Alexa frequently can't answer your questions. You can watch plenty of YouTube videos that demonstrate that. I will say that I also have Phillips HUE bulbs in my rooms and the Echo works great to turn on/off lights or to dim them just by voice commands. I would say that between the Echo and the Google product the Echo is more advanced in the "skills" that you can activate although the Google one references the google search engine to come up with answers/results. All in all it's a fun gadget but still has a ways to go in its development
