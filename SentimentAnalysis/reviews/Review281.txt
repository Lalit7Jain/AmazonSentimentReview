I like my Amazon Echo.  I'm still working on learning how to use it LOL!.  My Wifi went down one day and I didn't know how to get my Amazon Echo to work.  Eventually with a turn off and on of the router Alexa woke up.  I think it is well worth the money. The best part is it doesn't take up a lot of space and it can be heard throughout the house. As well it's easily relocatable.
