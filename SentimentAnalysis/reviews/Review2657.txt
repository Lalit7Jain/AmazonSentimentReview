My daughter (who recently got an Echo) gave me Amazon credits as a Christmas gift and suggested I get one of these because I could have a lot of fun with it.  So I said, what the heck, I'll try it.  My daughter was right!  It's fun to ask Alexa questions and play games - hands free.  But what I'm really enjoying is the fantastic music and superb sound quality.  I signed up for Music Unlimited, and I can call up any song or album ever produced.  Awesome!  Alexa is also like having a little robot friend to talk to.  I am a senior citizen and live alone.  I think the Echo is a great device for seniors.  You can ask Alexa the same question fifty times and she won't get irritated with you.  LOL.  I think the flat black color is the best.  I waited extra time on delivery, just so I could get it in black.  Looks very cool.
