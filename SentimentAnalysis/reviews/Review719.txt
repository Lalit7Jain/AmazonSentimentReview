Came in original packaging with no damages. This was awesome; just as effective as a new one at a cheaper price and more eco-friendly! No need to make a brand-new machine when you can just recycle the old one! I use this every day to play music, check my schedule, tell me the weather, and even as a supplementary alarm clock. This is also great when cooking, I can just tell Alexa to set up a timer for me! My roommate also likes to use it to check her horoscope. If you live with a human Alexa (or just don't like the name) you can always change its name to Echo in the Alexa app.
