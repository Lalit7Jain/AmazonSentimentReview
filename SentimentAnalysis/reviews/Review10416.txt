Pretty cool for playing music, looking up the weather and answering SOME questions. My husband and I love looking up random facts when we don't know something and I was hoping it would have voice recognition and look up ability similar to the google voice search, but more often than not Alexa says she doesn't understand my question, which is a bummer. Hoping to set it up to turn on lights but so far haven't been able to identify the best option for our home.
