I bought the Echo because it had all the apps that I listen to (iHeartRadio and Spotify) plus the flash briefings are good to have. I wish there was more selections on Flash Briefings. Other than that Alexa is useful to have as it can tell weather, commute times, news reports, having exclusive deals, buying from the device, and other "skills" like meditation and whatnot. So far I have no gripes apart from me having to speak loud from time to time since Alexa can't hear me, though I may have to retrain the device again to recognize my voice. Other than that I do recommend the Echo since it is pretty useful and the sound is excellent for the price.
