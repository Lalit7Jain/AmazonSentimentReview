Great idea but needs a ton of improvement in speech recognition and smart search. My benchmark is iPhone for speech recognition and Google for smart search. I am always giving Alexa a chance since the cost is minimal but keep getting disappointed and even frustrated at times. Mostly using it to play songs for our toddler. That pretty much summarizes my impression of this product: it is still at its infancy.
