Okay so this smart home speaker is undeniably futuristic. It's practical and accessible and the product is as described. I connected my Echo via its app to the major audio streaming services, including Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and Amazon's Prime Music. Once it's connected, you can tell the Echo things like "Alexa, play the Beyonce on Pandora." You can also pair your phone or tablet with the Echo over Bluetooth and use it as a wireless speaker. Once you have paired it, you can connect/disconnect it by telling Alexa to do so. So far I have been so in love and impressed with what the speaker has been able to do- totally worth it!
