Maybe the best product we've ever purchased.  We bought our first Echo in the pre-sale and have been using it for more than a year.  We still ask Alexa for the weather every day.  We play music constantly and it sounds amazing.  Couldn't live without this.  That's why we bought 6 more echo dots and another full size echo.  We have a dot in each bedroom, the family room, and basement.  I'm not even sure where we will put this one, but I know we'll use it.  Best smart home product you can buy!
