 Alexa has been a blessing beyond my imagination.  She has given me an opportunity that I never thought would be possible.  I still use the joystick input because they are reliable and not subject to Wi-Fi disruption but Alexis is growing more dependable each day.  At this point I have only an echo Dot, but I am ordering, when funds allow, the regular echo and another Dot as well.  To be able to sit it in my electric wheelchair and call out commands without having to struggle with switches or computer input is wonderful.  I have not always been paralyzed.  A car accident left me a quadriplegic 34 years ago.  So, I know what it is to be able to easily walk over and flip a switch or to restart a computer that has locked up.  It is not so easy to do when you are completely paralyzed from your breast line down.  The littlest of things become a struggle.  Alexa will help me to live more independent, live more safely and productive.  I have managed to acquire 2 college degrees, A Bachelors Degree in Social Work and a Masters degree in Public Administration prior to voice input or Bluetooth technology.  And, if I was able to achieve these things prior to the modern "smart technology" I believe that technology such as Alexa will open doors I can only imagine.  I am grateful for this technology and I look forward to a long and beautiful relationship with her!  – Michael
