Do not buy this product. Echo by Amazon is cyberterrorism, which is a felony crime.  Invasive, greedy, serious privacy concerns that our Echo activated without any Alexa voice commands. Placed Echo is kitchen, and listening mode seems to be on all the time.  Without asking Alexa,  Echo activated on it's own, asking if we wanted to buy various products and music.  Q&A for Alexa demonstrated clear prejudice and filtered responses. Music requested might play one song, but then forced an up-sell to listen to any more music from the same artist.  Blatant computer fraud and information theft. Seriously considering a class action lawsuit.
