Alexa does not connect to the TV fire stick. So I could not play anything from YouTube and play it on my tv that was my biggest disappointment. Asking questions to Alexa was another disappointment because it did not understand a lot of my questions. In these two matters Google home is by far superior. Even my three year old was allegedly to play his favorite thomas and friends on TV using Google home and Google cast. He was not too happy with Alexa. I did not care so much about ordering stuff on amazon using Alexa I like to see an image of the item first.
