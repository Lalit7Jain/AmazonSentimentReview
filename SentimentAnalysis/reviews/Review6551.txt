The only thing i like about this is the sound quality / volume. It's voice recognition is awful. My bathroom is right next to my bedroom in my apartment and it can't even pick up my voice from there or from in my closet. It also infuriates me that it will not play my iTunes music via voice command. I have paid hundreds of dollars to apple to buy music legally over the years and amazon is so greedy and short sided that they refuse to integrate my iTunes purchases.
