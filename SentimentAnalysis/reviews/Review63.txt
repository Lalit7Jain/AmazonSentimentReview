After I purchased our second Echo, Google Home hit the market and I was first in line.  That competing product has so much promise, even given its initially limited functionality, especially in terms of smart home device control support.  I returned it within a week, and that decision had nothing to do with its initially limited functionality.  It was due to sound quality.
