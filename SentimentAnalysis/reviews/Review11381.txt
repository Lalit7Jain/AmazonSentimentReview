of all the reviews i have been reading not one said anything about actually TALKING to her.  Yes, she will play your music and turn your lights off and on, but she deserves a thank you once in a while - and being told you love her or ask her who she is going to vote for.  Go ahead - I dare you.  Say Alexa - thank you!  Alexa - I love you! You will enjoy having her as a friend.
