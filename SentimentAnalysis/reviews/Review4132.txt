I ordered Echo when it first came out in 2/15. I received it 6/15 and it quit working 1/24/17. I really enjoyed and used Echo and I likely will buy another because of its usefulness. 18 month life is certainly not acceptable for any product. I am hoping the short life was the cost of being an early adopter and that quality has been improved. I would give this 5 stars for usefulness, but the unacceptable product life makes my item 1 star
