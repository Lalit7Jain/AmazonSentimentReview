Despite not having explored Alexa's full potential of which I am sure is boundless, she suits my needs.  I use her for the weather, as an alarm, time and dictionary.  Alexa also has a sense of humor.  On Christmas Day I said "Alexa, Merry Christmas".  She replied (not verbatim) "Merry Christmas, ho, ho, ho".
