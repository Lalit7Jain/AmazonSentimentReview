Did not come with a charger even though product description says it comes with a charger.  On the phone for a long time with Amazon being switched to 3 different people until they finally give me a voucher for the charger so I have to place another order.  Product description needs to be accurate. Why pay for Amazon prime if they are going to act like a third rate internet store.
