Recently, I've been studying for some molecular biology courses. Now and then I come across a word I don't know, and I'll ask "Alexa, what is a lysosome?" or "Alexa, what does histopathological mean?" And SHE ALWAYS SAYS I DON'T KNOW, or I don't understand the question. Sometimes she offers a Bing link in the Alexa app but I'm pretty sure the whole point of the Echo was for it to be hands-free...
