Getting Alexa to play music, was challenging, to put it nicely. Once we bucked up the additional money to get a year's subscription for Amazon music, all was well in the universe, but the ads are misleading. The ads lead you to believe that Alexa will do anything for you, but without additional money she isn't smart enough.  With that said, she is bonding well with my daughter (9 years old) which makes me a happy mom.
