The Amazon Echo has changed my life. I absolutely love all the extra perks beyond just playing music. I play the Word Master game when I do laundry. My kids and I love the knock knock jokes, especially since they are clean and kid friendly! I have used it to get recipes, weather reports and steps to removing stains. It is so easy to enable new skills and its so exciting to see new skills being added daily! I have become addicted to news reports in the morning as I make my coffee and I couldn't imagine not having Echo around. My excitement and love for my Echo has caused 2 family members and a friend to purchase one too!
