This is the first time I've done a review and is to point a finger at Amazon. I like the Echo but have come up against a wall. After talking to their not to sharp people with (strangely) Indian accents that's difficult to understand. The problem is the blue tooth on the Echo only works with portable devices and not surround sound system receivers like the Sony STR-DH750 that has blue tooth capacity. The sound is OK on the Echo but come on Jeff (CEO) you think no one would want to use your Prime Music without voice commands GEEZ!!!! I feel like I've being scammed by the people doing the bad impersonations of the IRS calling from India...
