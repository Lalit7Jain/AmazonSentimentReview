Cons: Alexa doesn't register my voice as easily as my husband's which annoys me. If the music is too loud, she has trouble hearing commands and you have to wait for a pause in the music or move close to the speaker. The app interface lets you control the volume, songs, etc directly. You have to say "Alexa" and then pause before the command, and I don't always know if she heard me until I finish the command and she does nothing. (I think there's a way to get her to "ding" when she hears you.) Wish she'd say "yes?"  Maybe it's just me, though. All in all, we couldn't do without her. We missed her while on vacation and had to look at the clock for the time, set alarms, look up the weather on our own. Haha, just kidding (sort of)
