We absolutely love the echo. We purchased a wink relay switch and a few smart bulbs so far and love the smart home features this offers already! We can tell Alexa to turn on/off lights and even tell her  to dim lights to a certain percentage due to the smart bulbs even though they aren't in dimmable switches! Alexa has opened up so many opportunities to expand our smart home. She picks up our voices even when we are in other rooms which is great. We haven't had any issues yet with her turning on when we didn't ask. She's always at the ready to give us the news or weather or play music or even Rock Paper Scissors! There are a ton of skills you can enable in the Alexa app that continue giving us more ideas on how to use her.
