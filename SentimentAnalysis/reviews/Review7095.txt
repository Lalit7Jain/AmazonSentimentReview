I just got this for Christmas from my wife and kids. I had been thinking about it since it came out with it's promo and baited discount price if you sign up to get it before it was available to others. I think it has a lot of potential. I don't have an automated home so I'm missing some of the features that others really love. I have an Iphone 6+ and a really nice Bose portable Bluetooth speaker so I don't need another speaker. For a music player it sounded way better than I expected. What I wanted was answers to questions. I thought she could just answer all of my questions whenever I ask them. To be fair she does. However always saying I can't find the answer to your question isn't really what I was looking for. I would estimate that she can answer about 10% of the questions I ask. These are questions like "how much does a Labrador retriever weigh?" or "which is bigger the moon or Ganymede?". It gets to feel like I hit the lotto when she actually has the answer. Sometimes she gives an answer and it's not even correct, like how much does a kangaroo weigh? Her answer was off by some 50%.
