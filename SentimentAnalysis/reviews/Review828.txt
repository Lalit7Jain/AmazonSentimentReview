I was surprised to receive this for Christmas from my parents. We don't have a "smart" house so none of the features like controlling lights or alarms works.  After 3 months, the only thing we really use it for is asking about the weather and converting US measurements to the metric system.  I did connect "I heart radio" to Alexa, but I couldn't say "Scan my favorite stations" or something similar.  In the end, I unplugged Alexa because I didn't like the thought of Amazon collecting even more information about my family.  I'm not big on conspiracy theories, but it just seemed like something/someone was invading my personal space.
