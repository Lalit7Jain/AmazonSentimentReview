I knocked Alexa off a table and broke it. I was disappointed to find out that there is no repair or parts available so I was forced to replace it. I chose this refurbished model to save a few dollars. Working well so far. I'm feeling good about the refurbish choice. I don't think we will not have this entertaining AI at our house even though we don't use all the control features.
