I don't yet have the smart lights, the smart heat, or smart sprinkler system setup with her. I don't mind using a light switch, and I have my IKEA light timers working just fine. But I just read that I can hook up a smart outlet and connect an electric blanket. I can tell her to warm up my bed, I may never leave the house.
