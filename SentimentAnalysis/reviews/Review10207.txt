I have one of these (which I ordered from another site that was offering them at a lower cost at the time) and one echo dot.  I keep this one in my bedroom and mainly use it to play music, since it has a better speaker than the dot.  It is not high end Bose quality, but much better in quality than old school low end computer speakers, and some bluetooth speakers.
