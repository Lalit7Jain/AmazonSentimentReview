I bought this thing in Feb 2015, never even bothered to plug it in until November 2015 when it became compatible with my Smartthings Hub. I used it a few times a day for random things (music, alarms, weather, etc). At the beginning of November 2016 it worked fine one day in the morning and later that night it was dead. No lights, no response, nothing. Amazon sent me a replacement ac adapter because apparently their early models were shipped with defective adapters. Still didn't work. Tech support said it was out of warranty but they could offer me a "special" price to replace it. That price was the same price listed on the website for everyone to purchase. How was this "special"?
