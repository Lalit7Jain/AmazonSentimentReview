We love Alexa. We use her every single day. Although we haven't quite set up a lot of the things that she can do, we just love being able to ask the weather and get news stories and listen to music. It's nice with a baby in our hands to have her play whatever we ask. I do think her voice recognition is not the greatest, but for the price point and the quality of the speaker, it is a good buy. I do wish that the news streaming services were better, but that may just be my ignorance when it come to technology.
