Would advise anyone to wait for other devices (ie. Google home which comes out in November) with Echo being the main device on the market it currently has little competition and therefore sounds better than it actually is. 2 calls to customer service and multiple forum searches and they still couldn't pair it with my prime music account. Whats worse is that they honestly have no idea why it doesn't pair ( when you call echo customer service there is even a recorded message saying if you are having issues pairing then try resetting your echo, not inspiring confidence...) This should be simple for them, they make the echo and its their service, shocking really can you imagine Apple or Google products that don't connect to their services like iTunes or Play? It wouldn't happen and that is what Amazon is missing in my opinion, its a great idea for a device but they lack something as a company to be able to really pull this off. Also when i was playing with the echo i was surprised how basic the commands had to be, it didn't understand many questions it was asked which is surprising. I expected a device that i could ask anything and it would respond, to be honest siri or google now seem more responsive...i expected more from what i had heard about Echo.
