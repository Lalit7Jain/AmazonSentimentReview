This was a bit of an impulse buy, which is totally not me. But I am so happy I got it. I haven't had a real stereo in a while and now I use this in this way. The sound is not bad. I just ask it to play a genre (classical, American folk) and it comes up with a play list. Or you can set up your own or ask for a particular artist.. If you have Amazon Prime, you can order on it. We have fun asking "Alexa" to tell us jokes, and can give you info on movie theater times, the latest political polls, and more. My high schooler uses it for homework. You can ask it, "Where was the Declaration of Independence signed? " and it will give you an answer.
