I received the Echo for Christmas. It's interesting. Once you "enable" certain skills, you have access to different things. Some of the things I have t tried is the "All-recipe"  Very nice. I have plenty of cookbooks, but it is nice to have some one tell you the steps, and by saying "pause" you can take your time. Playing music is ok, not great. I tried to link my Spotify but would have to go from free to paid Spotify, which i am not willing to do. I listen to  head-line news. I still have a lot to learn about it. Up until now it is nice, but not a WOW - Great item. Maybe as more corporations tab in to it, it will improve. All i can say now is, it is interesting.
