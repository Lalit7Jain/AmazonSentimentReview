Received our Echo today and I am hooked.  We've been asking Alexa random questions all day and she has been great at answering them.  Playing amazon music worked well and the speaker is AMAZING.  Although, when we had it up pretty loud with some music on, she had a hard time hearing me.  It also showed up with a greasy blue goop substance around the volume twister that I assume is meant to make it spin seamlessly?  Not sure, but I spun it in pretty good and wiped the rest away.
