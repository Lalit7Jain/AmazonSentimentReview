I bought this as a gift for my husband and I can't wait to give it on Christmas morning. I opened the package just to make sure it arrived safely, and was really impressed at the quality. It's got a good weight to it, not easily knocked over when sitting out. I read through the instructions, so it wasn't time consuming on Christmas morning, and was pleasantly surprised to find out that it's very simple to operate.
