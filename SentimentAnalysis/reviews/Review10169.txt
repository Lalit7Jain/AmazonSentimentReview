The games for our kids were awful. We tried 20 questions and an animal game and a few math games. The interaction is awkward as Alexa is always in a rush and the whole household has to be quiet or she'll interpret the noise as an answer and move on. With two kids, one just has to be very quiet so one's answer doesn't mess up the other's game. She was equally terrible with the few math games we tried as she'd often not hear the correct answer correctly, tell the kid they were wrong, and then the kid's confused as to what the right answer is as they can't figure out what the right answer is (given they were just told the right answer was wrong.)
