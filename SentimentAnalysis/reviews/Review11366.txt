I  used to love my Echo, which I received as a gift in March of this year. However, by October the voice recognition was weak and occasionally the speakers produce a strange sound. I have to shout "ALEXA" multiple times. I wish it held up because it was great when I first got it. It has a harder time connecting to the internet now (even though everything is the same as it has always been on the wifi end of things) because there are times when it pauses a song for a moment before resuming. I tried contacting customer service and their only (adamant) advice was to restart the echo (which I did many times).
