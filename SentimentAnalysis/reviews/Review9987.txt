Bought an Echo because I liked the Echo Dot. The tech is still a work in progress, but it's good enough to see the potential, and it's already worth having. There are times when you can ask it a seemingly simple question that it can't answer, or when it gets something wrong because it doesn't understand, but that's the type of thing that will get worked out over time as more people ask questions and Amazon has a larger pool of data to work with.
