It's surprising what Echo can NOT do.  It reacts to women's voices better than mens'.  Also, the frequency with which I get: "I'm sorry, I don't have the information for the question you just asked" is highly annoying.  Strictly a toy with a good speaker.  Anyone with a smartphone doesn't need this toy.  And I HATE that it is constantly listening, often perking up without the Wake Words.  Maybe we should worry about Google spying on us. What happened to "Do no Evil" Eric Schmidt?
