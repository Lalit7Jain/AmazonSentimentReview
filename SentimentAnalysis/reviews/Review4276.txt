with this Echo,as soon as I plugged it in I used the reset button on the bottom. Many people found this needed to be done & the idea to unplug & re- plug the power cord to get the setup to work. Both my Echo & Dot are now online. One in my Den & the other in my Bedroom as our new Hands free Radio, Clock, & info Center. Both are called Alexa & setup on this one was easier because I had already setup the Dot first.. All the Music & radio stations I enabled are used by both. Just needed to get it online & was done :)
