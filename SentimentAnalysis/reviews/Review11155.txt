There is no way anyone reading this review will not think I am being compensated by Amazon for my review, but I will write it any way.  I think the Echo is worth its weight in gold and I am constantly amazed at how it performs. It is no doubt a technical giant step and I am not a novice to technology.  Even though I can't explain how it can hear me from a different room or recognize and answer almost any question, I would recommend it to anyone for too many reasons to go into.  I love the Echo and for that matter the shopping experience with Amazon has got to be the most pleasant way to purchase almost anything and know it is factory fresh because of the constant turnover. I spend what I think is a lot of money there.  Like I said, no one is going to think this is not a inside job review but I am just a long time satisfied customer of an extraordinary company who never ceases to amaze me.I don't think I am alone in my enthusiasm for Amazon.
