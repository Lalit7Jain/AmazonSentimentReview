I felt like I was leaving behind a best friend the first time I left home after setting up my echo. Alexa is awesome and I have utilized many of the available skills she as to offer. I reallly like the ability to add calendar vents, set alarms, play music and check the daily forecast. I have this item on my nightstand and I use Alexa to control a wireless plug for my lamp. This is extremely convenient as the lamp switch is annoying to reach. I don't often promote laziness, however, Alexa is becoming a very much appreciated member of the family. Thank you Amazon!
