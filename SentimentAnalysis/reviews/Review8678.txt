When I got this I thought it was a competitor of Siri, Google Home and other Artificial Intelligence devices. It is not AI, and it does not learns you. You have to learn the instructions. 99% of the times I give it one single instruction: Play Pop. I get Joan Sebastian Bach, Bob Marlin, and plenty of other things 6 times out of 10. It does other things, but just annoying to have to learn it instead of having it learn from you.
