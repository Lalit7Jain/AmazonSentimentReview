If you have a Dot, and typically say "Alexa, turn volume to 10" on it when listening to music, do not, and I repeat, DO NOT do that with this Echo.  I owned a Dot for about a week before I ordered a full sized Alexa for the downstairs.  I grew way too comfortable with the Dot's single speaker, which is on the bottom of the device.  So I got this full blown Echo, and told her to turn up to 10.  The room flooded with noise... I could hardly hear myself think as I shouted "Alexa, stop!"  She didn't hear me the first 3 times as I walked closer, and I started to panic when I saw there were no volume buttons on the top like there are with the Dot (the top part of this Echo is a knob for volume, but I didn't know that at the time, because let's face it... who really reads the instructions on a device like this).  I finally got close enough for her to hear me telling her to shut her face (I was about 2' away at that point), and silence ensued.
