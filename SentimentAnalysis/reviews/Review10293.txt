What Alexa flat will NOT do is "Play Brahms 2nd Symphony".  It doesn't matter if the music is in your library, or in prime.  Alexa (really the query engine behind Alexa) does not recognize the concept of the COMPOSER.  I have been able to find no query directions from Amazon which would help me phrase this either "Play symphony number 2 by composer Brahms" for example.  No matter how many times you rephrase the query Alexa will not do this.
