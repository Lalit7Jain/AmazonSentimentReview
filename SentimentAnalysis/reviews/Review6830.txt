This echo is currently sitting in our kitchen getting used dozens of times a day. Quick timers, ingredient conversions, product ordering, news, temperature control (nest), music. And yes, we've ordered a Pizza. Whenever people ask "why don't you use your phone"... Because unlike so many we aren't tethered to our phones, and the echo doesn't need to be unlocked and touched to be useful. We liked it so much a second was purchased for the bathroom. If Amazon can get it integrated into the Fire TV and control Sonos volume, it'll be an even more indispensable part of our home.
