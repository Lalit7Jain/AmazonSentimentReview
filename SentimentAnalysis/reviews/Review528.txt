Have really enjoyed my Amazon Echo.  Alexa gives me the latest headlines, weather, and even a joke every morning.  What a great way to start the day.  She has even helped me find songs that I didn't know the name.  She is amazing.  I am still learning all of her abilities.  I am also going to use Alexa to reorder some products.  I am so happy that she is here.
