UPDATE - after much back and forth with Amazon, they agreed to exchange my defective Echo.  It should not have been this difficult to convince them that the device was defective.  I received another refurbished Echo and it appears to work just fine.  I'm changing my review to 4 stars.  I love the Echo.  But I would think twice before purchasing a refurbished one.
