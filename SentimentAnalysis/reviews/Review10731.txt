 Alexa cannot hold any kind of a conversation.  It’s like her coders were complete technological drones void of imagination. She can’t understand you  half the time and, when she can, she has no idea how to respond. Seriously, Amazon?  Whoever is responsible for that area of Alexa’s development should have to live with a thousand Alexas in a very dark, sound proof 4x4 room….forever.
