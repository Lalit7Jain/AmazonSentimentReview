We welcomed Alexa to our family after Black Friday where we got a deal.  We have had such great fun having her tell us jokes, play our favorite music (we use Spotify), challenge her on the 20 questions game, play Jeopardy with her, find out the weather, and, of course, the kids love asking her their homework questions.  Truly, it is like having a new game to play with.  The Echo is easy to set up - yep, even I, the least tech-savy of the family, set it up.  It is no wonder this item sold out on-line just before Christmas.
