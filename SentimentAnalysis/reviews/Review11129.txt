Originally LOVED my Echo. I've had it for almost two years now. It worked perfectly all the time at the beginning. Over the past eight months or so, performance has significantly declined. It started to become intermittent what Alexa would hear and understand. Now it's to the point that I ask Alexa to turn the volume down and she asks me what device I am looking for. Sometimes I don't get any response at all.  It's pathetic and there's nothing I can do since Amazon only offers a one year warranty. For the cost of this device, Amazon should be offering a five year warranty. Disappointed and as much as I liked the device, I probably won't buy another to replace the one I have unless Amazon increases the length of its warranty (or decreases the price).
