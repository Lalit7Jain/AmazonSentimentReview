The Amazon Echo is pretty damn awesome.  I purchased it for my father, who is a tetraplegic, with grand visions of him finally listening to audiobooks, music, being able to turn the TV on and off on his own, but alas, his voice isn't strong enough to get Alexa's attention.  So I had to keep her for myself.  Darn.  :)
