My Echo has will not connect to Wi-Fi and continues to complete set up and then return to set up. The Amazon customer service team was thorough and helpful, but I have spent three hours troubleshooting myself, and an hour and ten minutes with Amazon customer service and technical support. I will be patient to wait for resolution in two days, but not enjoying my Echo experience so far.
