My husband got me an Amazon Echo for Christmas.  I was previously unfamiliar with them (if it's not on Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, I probably don't know about it!).  I wasn't overly thrilled since I didn't know what to expect.  I told him we could set it up and play around with it later when it was ready.  To my astonishment, unlike almost every other techie gadget we have, it worked almost immediately!  No long charge time, no complicated set-up.  We just plugged her in and turned her on.
