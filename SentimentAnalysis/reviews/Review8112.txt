This product is still in beta.....after many email all I get is "we are working on the problem". They admit I am not alone with my problem....I paid the full $200 last fall and I can not get Alexa to play prime music that I downloaded to my iPad....she says...."I can not find...."....on top of that Amazon wants more $$ to get more music... they offered me $10 to go away... she tells me the weather, reads the news....offers useless skills but can not find downloaded prime music....I told to fix my problem so I could add a "dot" and more music....their reply? "Go away....we are done trying to find a solution to your problem"....I offered possible solutions and was thanked for my input but they can not fix the problem....so beware of the bug in the system....I see they have reduced the price to $140_. . That does not make me a happy customer either.....I'm out $60.....and they offered me $10......
