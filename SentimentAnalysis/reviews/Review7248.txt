I haven't been able to spend as much time as I would like with it yet, but this period of the year in December is always busy. The list function is handy, and it's nice to get the time, set a timer, or get the weather without going to my phone all the time. As I discover new features and get more used to it, I will continue updating my review. Although there are thousands of reviews on here, so I'm sure you can find what you're looking for.
