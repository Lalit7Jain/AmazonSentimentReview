While product works as intended it interfered with our home network and internet. Echo disrupted Airplay and DLNA streaming to the receiver and wifi speakers.  Initially thought the problem was our modem and router so replaced those devices and the disruption continued to happen.  At the request of the technician from our ISP we started unplugging different items connected to our home network and once I unplugged Echo the issues resolved.  After two phone calls to Amazon tech support they were unable to resolve the problem. I was offered a $25 dollar credit for a new Echo.  My current echo was less than 15 months old so I thought that was unacceptable.  Will try plugging it back in every now and then and see if there was an update that resolves the issue.  We spent months trying to figure out what was wrong with out home network and internet.  Even change ISP.
