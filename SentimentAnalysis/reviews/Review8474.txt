The Echo works great for playing music, but not much else. Alexa claims she will ask Bing if she doesn't know the answer to a question you ask, but I have not found this to work. Google Home looks much more promising (I bought the Echo before it came out) and if it is as good at answering questions as Google Now on my phone, that would be what I would buy today. I am also disappointed that there is no out-of-the-box supported way to stream music from a DLNA server, like Plex.
