This is great for any family and any age. We are a young family who got it for the grandparents. They love it, and now we love it so much, we got one for ourselves. This will be really nice when the kids are older and doing homework. I love the classic echo better than the dot because it has the speaker built in, which makes finding the perfect spot for it so much easier. Alexa understand multiple accents and tones of voice, which is very nice. She will even play audio books for you. I recommend getting the remote as well. If we are in another room and don't want to shout, we can use the remote.
