I like the small footprint this device uses on your desk and speakers have good sound delivery. Microphone works well, hears you very well. I used to have a moshi alarm clock and it only recognizes better my husband's voice. Amazon echo recognizes both our voices well and good.  One of these days we will try the light control aspect, we just do not have those lights compatible with it yet. We tested Alarm setting it was easy and you can configure using choosing from the sound selection or celebrity voice in the selection. Is this device a good buy, for us it is. Just make sure delivery of the product comes on time, otherwise some may choose to cancel the order altogether, which we almost did!
