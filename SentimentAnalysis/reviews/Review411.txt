I am so glad I bought Alexa.  You can set it up to your own personal options.  I have to be careful because Alexa is very sensitive when she hears someone mention her name either on TV or when I'm speaking to a friend on speakerphone.  You have the option to turn off her microphone but then I guess it defeats the purpose and I would forget to turn it back on.
