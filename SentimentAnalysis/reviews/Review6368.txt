It's not as sophisticated as the computer on the Enterprise D, but the Echo is an amazing device.  I was debating whether to get the lower priced Dot, since I read some reviews about the speaker system in the Echo not being that great when playing music at high volumes.  Anyways, I'm glad that I decided on the Echo, since it has pretty good sound quality for it's size.  If I had purchased the Dot, I would have had to invest in good quality bluetooth speaker as well.
