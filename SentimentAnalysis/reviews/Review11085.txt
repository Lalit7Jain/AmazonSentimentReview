We love our Alexa and use it every day for music, shopping list and my 8 yr old used it to help look things up. In fact today she said, "Alexa is part of the family." Best purchase we have made on song time. I am getting my husband the for Christmas. The only improvement I would suggest is being able to change the name from Alexa. We really wanted to program it to answer to computer.
