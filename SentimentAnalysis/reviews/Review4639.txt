I debated for months, although I badly wanted to add Alexa to our household. After missing a few great sales, I finally caught the Echo at a special price and jumped. Alexa makes my life easier in all the ways I expected. Her shopping and to-do list features are probably two of the most utilized by me, because I'm a huge fan of making lists. My seven year old daughter loves games like The Magic Door, often exclaiming "It's SO realistic!" as she and Alexa head off on another adventure. The fifteen year old in the house likes to have Alexa surprise me with random songs he wants me to hear, so it's been fun bonding over and expanding our eclectic musical interests. My parents, both in their 70's, were a bit confused the first time they heard "Alexa, turn it down", wanting to know who in the world Alexa is, but they've gotten used to me blurting out seemingly random conversations with an invisible assistant. All in all, we love Alexa. I've actually added a Dot in my bedroom and my son's as well, so now she can properly manage every corner of our home. My husband worries she might get a little "too smart", but we expect to wipe that thought from his mind soon ... right, Alexa?
