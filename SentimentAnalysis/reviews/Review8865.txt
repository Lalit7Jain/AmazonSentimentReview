This could be an otherwise great product but is an EPIC FAIL regarding tech support.  The iphone application has 2-star review in the Apple Store.  People say it sucks because it does.  What is the point of having all of these automated systems and "skills" if the app doesn't even work where you can load them?????  Apparently there was some type of update in October from the reviews that killed this system.  Why it is now December and this has not been addressed I have no clue.  Amazon is dropping the ball big time.
