I have been making my house a smart home slowly but surely and this was the icing on the cake as it now allows me to voice control everything else. I love all the additional features, especially once you pair it with IFTT. I had no problem purchasing a referb as I believe refurbished items are sometimes better as someone has gone through them and fixed there manufactured issues. Mine has been perfect.
