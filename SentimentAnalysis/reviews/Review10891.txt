In the first initial days of use, but so far, love the product. The audio clarity, volume, and bass is decent given its size. It's responsive and accurate - misunderstandings are rare. Functionality for me is mostly limited to playing music from Amazon Music Unlimited, playing radio, and alarm clocks... but I look forward to trying out the online shopping, ordering delivery food, and e-books/podcast functionality. Amazon is continuously developing / upgrading it's functionality and can't wait to see what's next. Personally, would love to see a "guitar tuner" app :)
