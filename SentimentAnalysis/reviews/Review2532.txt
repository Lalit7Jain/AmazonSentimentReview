Alexa is pretty cool however, I am very very disappointed with the fact it does NOT work with ADT, it does NOT work with Ical. So I cannot use half the product and interfaces it claims it can do. I called Amazon they blame ADT and Apple. I order from Amazon almost daily but I am very disappointed they are advertising this product works with these devises and interfaces with them and it does NOT.
