I bought the Echo for my 71 yr old mother, who has never mastered how to use a computer, let alone a smartphone. She loves to listen to Spanish music, but we have horrible stations where we live. So I bought her the Echo, figuring the less she actually had to DO to make it work, the better. I played with it for a couple weeks before Christmas so that I could show her how to use it, and it's SO EASY. The setup for super easy...took me 2 minutes. All I have to say is "Alexa, play Celia Cruz" (my mom's favorite), and immediately, Alexa informed me that she was shuffling Celia Cruz songs, and started playing them. She sets timers for me, alarms, tells me the weather, and tells me jokes! I almost didn't give this to my mom. But the guilt would have been too much for me, so now my mom owns it. She doesn't have to worry about pressing wrong buttons or anything...just speak. LOVE IT.
