One of the most frustrating things is that you never remember the magic phrase for the skill you just enabled. So I live in New York and a subway status skill would be incredible. I go and search and find a ton. I enable two to see which might be better. Each has convoluted phrasing necessary to find out the subway status of a given train line. I jumble the phrasing after enabling the skills and end up using neither. Wasted opportunity.
