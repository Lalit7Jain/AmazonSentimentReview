It's OK, I think this is the first time that buying something from amazon BECAUSE of the positive reviews has steered me wrong....I am not that impressed with this device as most others seem to be. I find it has a very limited use.  I can NOT stream music to an external amp via Bluetooth...which means no whole house music.  The music it plays is OK if you are sitting right next to it but it is noting like what my onyko mukti zone av/receiver can produce. Further, it only has the ability to receive a streaming audio (like from your iPhone),  Really? what good is that?  Why would I want to stream my phone to a small  speaker?  It is a stand alone siri like speaker device.  Most to the questions you ask it, it can't answer or gives you a weak bogus answer that you really don't want to spend time listening to.  As for hooking up devices for it to control...it is not automatic, (it does not recognize anything on the network) and I don't seem to have any of the devices it can control.  I have a nest thermostat but I really don't need voice control over that.  I guess I am still missing the point with this thing.  I suppose if I was  handicapped this could have a use but otherwise it just sits there.  When we hooked it up initially it got a lot of attention but after 2 days, it is just sitting there and no one seems to bother with it. Everyone has lost interest with it already and has forgotten it is even there.  No one asked it anything yesterday except the TV triggered it with an word that sounded like Alexa and everyone got a laugh. All I really wanted was for it to play music thru the stereo and it can't do that.  Now they say the dot can do that but I have my doubts after using this more expensive device and I really don't want two of these things to talk to.
