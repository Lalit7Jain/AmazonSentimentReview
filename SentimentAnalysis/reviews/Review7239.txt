Love the Amazon Echo!  However, I have just had it set up for about 2 weeks now, and am still learning to use it and remembering the "catch phrases" to get the information I am searching for.  A lot of what the Echo provides (like music, time, weather, briefings, managing our evolving smart home, etc) is intuitive, but there is still a learning curve for me to figure out other things.  I was a little disappointed that I could not just ask Alexa a question that you might be able to find from searching online for the answer.  Perhaps time and training will improve this process.
