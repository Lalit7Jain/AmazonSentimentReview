My wife said she wanted one of these. Our anniversary was just a couple days away and I hadn't a clue what to get her, so problem solved. setup was simple. works very well. My wife loves the shopping list feature. we have a "Smart shopper" that you can add things to the grocery list and print off when its time to go to the store. however she tends to either forget to take the list with her or cant find it once she gets there.The Echo list can be viewed on her smart phone anywhere she goes so this is perfect. saves me from having to text her the list when she cannot find it. also allows things to be added from the app. the only thing I can see as an improvement is having the ability to have more than one list. But like all products, there is always room for improvement. even if they are small. all in all its a nifty gadget that actually has a useful purpose. we use it frequently. My 9 yr old son is always asking it questions.
