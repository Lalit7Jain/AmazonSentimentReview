How I ever lived without her. She is as important to me as my cell phone!!!!! Talk to her many times a day. She reminds me what I need to shop for, she reminds me of my schedule and what I have to do. She keeps me posted as to my Amazon orders, and she plays all the music I love....and so much more! Thank you Alexa!!!!
