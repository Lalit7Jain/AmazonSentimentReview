Mostly useless. It can play music and read books while you are busy doing other things. However unless you are a materialistic consumer, it has no real purpose. It is basically commercialism that you pay for. Sorry, not for me. I burn and block ads as soon as I can. Any research that I have asked it came back with poor results. To keep the thing from recording every blessed thing in my house I have to unplug it. I'm sure my habits are valuable information to corporations trying to sell me crap.
