The actual product is a lot smaller in person. Which is a good thing if you plan on traveling with it. It does a lot of nifty things and it's pretty cool how far off you can be when speaking to the echo. It's quick, responsive and thus far realiabe. I would say if you're interested in purchasing something that can do it all, this is your best bet.
