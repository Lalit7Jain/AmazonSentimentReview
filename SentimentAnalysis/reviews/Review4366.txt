We've used it for less than a week. Alexa has very good voice recognition, but still has some issues with not finding requested information. We use it more for music requests, which she fantastically does. She adjusts volume on demand. We've used her to record shopping lists. The Echo app for my iPhone works great to also control her, as well as using the web app to do the same.
