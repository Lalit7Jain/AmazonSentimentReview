We were unsure about how this would fit into our life and we keep finding ourselves using it more and more and look forward to its continued evolution.  We just installed a Nest thermostat and connected the Echo to it very easily.  On a side note keep it at least 5' away from your tv, I had it on the same wall unit our tv is installed on and found that Alexa kept tuning into "alexa" spoken on a broadcast.  Also being so close to the tv it often had difficulty picking up my command voice.
