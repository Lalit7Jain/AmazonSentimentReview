My Alexa is set up downstairs, located pretty centrally in the family room/dinette/kitchen area. Most mornings I ask Alexa to tell me what appointments I have on my calendar when I come downstairs and making breakfast, then ask her to "set an alarm for" the time I need to be ready for my first appointment.
