The Amazon Echo can do so many things & learns more as you use it!  The 2 down firing speakers, One sub-woofer & one regular speaker sounds great when you're playing music. For as small as the speakers are it has more base than expected. The base is not overwhelming, but is pretty good considering the size of the speakers.  The Omni directional mikes are real sensitive even over other noise in the room, they can pick up your voice from just about anywhere in the room.  So far, I'm really pleased with my Amazon Echo!
