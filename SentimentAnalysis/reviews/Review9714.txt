Received ECHO today and set for return tomorrow. Unable to maintain wi-fi connection and had to reset it at least a dozen times without success. Have no difficulties with wi-fi connections on any other devices in same location. Actually went into basement and connected next to router (2.4 GHz/5 GHz automatic shifting) still with only 30 seconds before it lost connection.
