I loved it.  BUT, I purchased it for my elder parents.  They had a much harder time with it.  Originally we thought that it would entertain them with  answers to easy questions. But it ended up confusing them and actually stopped conversation. So I returned the product.  There were no problems with installing or use.  Just isn't something that worked for them.
