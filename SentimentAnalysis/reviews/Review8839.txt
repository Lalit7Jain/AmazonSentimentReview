Addicted so far.  Nest integration is perfect, but Hue lights are a bit too cumbersome.  Easy to turn the lights on and off, but if you want change the colors or scenes it's a bit more complex and easier to just open up the app. I would like to see Alexa's knowledge expanded without having enable so many 'skills.'
