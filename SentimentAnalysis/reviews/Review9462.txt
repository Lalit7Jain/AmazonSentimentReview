I thought about getting one for ages but wasn't convinced.  But, after talking to a friend who has one and finding a great deal on the Echo through QVC, I bought it.  I love it.  I always have trouble getting things up and running but this was so simple I didn't any difficulty syncing things up and was listening to music in no time.  Alexa is totally incorporated into my life.  She keeps my to do list for me,  She adds my shopping list to my iPhone.  She reads my audible books to me and wakes me up in the morning. She's funny too.  Today I said "Alexa how is your day going". She replied. "My day is going just fine". And she added something about how nice it was to have me around". Another time I had turned her off and all of a sudden she started talking as if she was.interacting with someone.  I asked her what she was doing and she said she was updating some things and learning new things.  No, I'm not crazy.  My husband heard our conversation and he said she was kind of amazing.  I got him the dot and he's just getting started with it but is amazed.  Get one or more.  You'll love her!
