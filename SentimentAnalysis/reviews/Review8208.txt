I think I'm in love...I bought Amazon Echo to play around with Lights and Electrical (turn off-on) and turn out my son loved it so much he wants the Echo Dot his room. Add skills as you like through Alexa app and it can keep you amazed for days. Little touchy on the voice from across the room but for the most part its great. Simple tasks from Alarms, weather, News brief can keep you updated on what's going on in the world as you do things around the house. Easy to setup....added my SmartThings (Samsung) and then my Phillips Light with almost to difficult...of course I could have read the instructions and made it a little smoother but hey nothing ventured, nothing gained.e Wish there was a way to sync Echo with Echo dot but still happy with the product.
