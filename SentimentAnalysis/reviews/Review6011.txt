As good as Alexa is now, there's room for improvement. One of the biggest features I wish Alexa had was recipe instructions—weird, I know, but hear me out. I cook nearly every day, and I would love to be able to follow a recipe for baba ganoush simply by saying, "Alexa, next" as she reads the instructions aloud. Right now, Alexa doesn't even know recipes exist really. When I asked, "Alexa, how do you make chocolate chip cookies?" she told me she didn't know the answer. The app reflected that by pointing me to a Bing search page for that question.
