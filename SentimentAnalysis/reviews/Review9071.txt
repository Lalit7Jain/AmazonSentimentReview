If I had known months ago, when I purchased my Echo, what I know now, I never would have made this purchase. It has been nothing but a hassle, an annoyance, and complete waste of money. Most of the Echo's usable functions are more easily used with your smart phone anyway. For our home at least, Alexa serves as not much more than a speaker for music and the occasional egg timer. Very, very disappointing. We should have bought the Google Home.
