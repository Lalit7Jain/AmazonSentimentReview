When I read reviews that say this is the best and most accurate voice recognition, I really have to wonder if they only own Apple products (or are paid reviewers).  After receiving the Echo for my birthday I've been comparing it Cortana on my computer and Google Now, and honestly, the most accurate voice recognition is probably Google (despite the fact the I almost never used it before receiving the Echo).
