 We've owned Alexa for around 1 1/2 years now.  She is very much part of our family.  She is most useful for us as a to-do list.  Anytime we need any grocery item or essential, we just ask Alexa to add to out to-do list and it shows up on our iphone.  I do wish the timer was an LED screen as it would be much more useful as a kitchen timer.  Attached is a video we made with Alexa.  Beware it can be a little scary..well not really.
