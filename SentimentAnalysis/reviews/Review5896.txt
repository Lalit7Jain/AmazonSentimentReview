The app is horrible.  I had to "set up" my app 3 times in the same day and finally uninstalled and reinstalled.  The interaction is very clunky.  The app alone could make me return this device.  It freezes up, resets (forces you to set up again), uses something called "cards" but without explanation of what they are.
