The highlight.  As a Prime member the Echo provides unlimited music of songs you'd actually want to listen to for only $3.99/month.  You can create playlists and call on songs directly - although the selection of the song is not always accurate.  This is probably the cheapest music service available and is great when you are in a certain mood or people are over.
