Just got Alexa in and set up...WOW, we love the music selection & look forward to using all the applicable programs....I do wish Amazon would supply a owners manual with instructions on how to use all the wonderful things Alexa can do...The device is small and fits well within the whole house, too bad it won't pick up in the garage even with a dot, but otherwise so far we are very happy with it...the music is endless..Also being part of Amazon Prime gives us extra applications to Alexa, So far except for lack of use instructions...Good job Amazpn
