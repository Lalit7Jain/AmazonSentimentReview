It worked great for about a month.  They for some reason it stopped working.  I spent more than 2 hours on the phone with Amazon tech support and got nowhere'.  We called AT&T and never got anywhere.  I'm moving over to Google.  Amazon should stay out of the hardware business!  Very frustrated, very dissatisfied with Echo and Amazon.
