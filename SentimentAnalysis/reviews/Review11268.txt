i think its a neat gadget.  we bought it on a whim when it first came out and intended to use it as a speaker for music.  it works well for that purpose, but definitely is not the best speaker out there.  i like to use it to tell time or weather or simple stuff, but it usually doesn't have answers to most of our questions.  it does have cool capabilities though per the biweekly "what can alexa do" emails...but you need to "add" the function via the app or have compatible devices
