I’ve found that all of the Prime services are quite limited – not only Music, but Video and Books. It’s especially hard to find anything of any real value in Books - mostly it’s stupid romances and mysteries. Video has a similar low ratio of classics to dreck. Now I've discovered the same problem exists in Prime Music. And compared to Prime services, Google Play and Google Search are a pleasure. They have enough good content that I use them at work constantly. I was expecting something similar for my home from Amazon.
