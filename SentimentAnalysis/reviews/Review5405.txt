Today alone, Alexa has found my cell phone for me as i was rushing out the door, had my grocery list on my phone, reminded me of a haircut, let me know the great song i heard was "shots" by imagine dragons and turned on light when i came in house with hands full. She is currently on task to let me know when dinner is done. New best friend <U+263A>
