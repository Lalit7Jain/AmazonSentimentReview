The only reason that I do not give the Echo 5 stars, is that it does not allow me to vocally send texts or make calls while connected via bluetooth to my phone. I feel like this is really basic, and it is quite unreasonable that this is not a feature considering some of the other not nearly as useful features the Echo offers.
