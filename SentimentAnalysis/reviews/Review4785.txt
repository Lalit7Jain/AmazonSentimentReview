I don't know where I was when this first came out but boy am I happy I found it now. Better late than never.  I love my echo so much so I went out and purchased 3 more echo dots for my kitchen, Bedroom and basement.  I love falling to sleep with the thunderstorm sounds/rain.  I use this unit everyday for music, Smart light switches/plugs, shopping lists, dictionary, news, questions, jokes, alarms and timers....you get the picture.
