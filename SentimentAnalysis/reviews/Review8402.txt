Love Alexa. She has helped with the weather, playing music, setting kitchen timers and controlling the house lights. My son loves asking her questions when he has trouble with his homework because she usually has an answer for it. I bought the refurbished one as it was cheaper but I wouldn't have even know that if I wasn't the one who ordered it. Now if only the family would listen just as well as her.  The speakers are also a good loud sound to play music.
