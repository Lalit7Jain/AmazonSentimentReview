Although the Echo I am writing about is the one our daughter gave us for Christmas she to is a big Amazon buyer, well it just happened I purchased one for my Husband for Christmas, when we opened daughter's gift all I could do is star at it lol....my Son in Law said what's wrong then I told him what I did.  But that's okay they had purchased their Echo from Amazon the first of the year and we liked it.  So now we have one I returned the I purchased back today.  Love Alexsa
