If you plan to use this as a bluetooth speaker, I highly suggest getting another product. It does work smoothly when if I stream the audio directly from Spotify, without pairing it with bluetooth though. However, I have actual playlists saved on my sd card on my phone that I would like to stream sometimes. If it can't even function as a basic speaker, what's the point? I have tried resetting both my phone and the Echo. I have tried inserting a paper clip to the reset function on the bottom of the Echo as suggested and still the same issues arise.
