One issue I have – and I know it’s one others have addressed – but linked Dots/Echo options would be very nice.  I would love the ability to sync all timers/music/alarms with an Echo and a Dot or two – of course the option to sync, not an automatic or for.  A Dot in a child’s room doesn’t need to be sync’d to the Echo in the living room – but the option to be able to sync that kitchen timer, music for a get together, etc. on the fly would be fantastic!
