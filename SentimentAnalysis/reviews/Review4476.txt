Oh my gosh I just love this thing!!  A relative insisted I needed one, but it sounded like an expensive gadget that I probably didn't need.  My curiosity increased as I kept hearing more people talk, but I still didn't "get" it.  It was just a coincidence that I was shopping for a wireless speaker during this time.  I looked at the Echo reviews from the standpoint of a wireless speaker, and while not the best, they were solidly good.  It was also significantly cheaper than the speakers I had bern looking at, so I decided why not?  I could have a fun little gadget at the same time!  I have to say that this "gadget" changed my life the very first day.  The sound is great, I can ask for any random song or sing genre and it will find and play.  I can call across the room to ask it to be louder or softer, or stop.  It tells me jokes, the time, the weather, answers random truvia queries, and enters on-the-spot items on my shopping and "to do" lists.  "Siri" and voice commands on my iPhone translate incorrectly ALL of the time.  Alexa has only mis-heard me twice so far, I talk to "her" all of the time, and the mistake was totally understandable.  She even tells me she's glad I'm home, if I ask if she missed me (I live alone) <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0082><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0082>
