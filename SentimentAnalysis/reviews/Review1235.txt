I was so hopeful that this was going to be a good experience, but she can't answer more than a short sentence, with an even shorter answer, and that's if your lucky. you get so tired of saying her name over and over agin just to get her to respond. she can't carry over from sentence to sentence without starting over. this is a waste of time, despite the other shortcomings like can't change radio stations, and on and on.........very disappointing experience, took it back we will see if they can ever really deliver on the promises.
