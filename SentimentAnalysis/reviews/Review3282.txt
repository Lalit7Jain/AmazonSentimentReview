Gave it to my husband for Christmas. Beginning in February it started saying it was having trouble understanding and to try again later.  Then it says it is having trouble connecting and to try again later.  This has been going on for 5 days. Tonight we got it to finally play music, then couldn't get it to shut off, stop playing music etc.  Had to unplug it.  Expected it to last over 30 days.
