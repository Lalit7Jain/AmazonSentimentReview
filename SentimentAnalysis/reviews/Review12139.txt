Alexa can be controlled by a phone app but is much easier to use the voice commands. I am currently watering the lawn and just started a timer by saying alexa start a 20 minute timer. This type of request can be done while music is playing and alexa will generally hear you over the music playing. after the music I end up using Echo as a timer on an everyday basis. cooking food, watering the lawn. timeouts for the kids :( are common uses for this and are just easier than getting out the phone to set a  timer.
