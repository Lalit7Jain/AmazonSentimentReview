Honestly not impressed with my little friend.  No offline life.  No battery so I can move it around the house with me.  I don't care to invest in a hundred little ones.  I actually was blown away by lack of battery.  MIGHT try the aftermarket batteries before returning.  But I'm probably returning her.  I only really wanted it for music, but my bluetooth speaker and phone is a better solution at a small fraction of the price.
