It is really not a good use experience with Alexa. There is a big problem obsesses me for a long time. My Alexa couldn't connect to the Wi-Fi, no matter I tried to connect it to the wifi with my mobile-phone  or the Windows Edge. I have done all the connection steps as the echo asks me to. The following picture is the connection trouble, can anyone help me with it?
