I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. We are still figuring out just how to use it. I will say that we are at times disappointed with her ability to find the answers to questions we ask. She is slightly more reliable than Siri, but still not great. She can do some great math, however! I use her quite a bit when I'm cooking and need to convert measurements. We are installing some smart lights in the house soon, and I'm sure she will continue to become more valuable to us as we learn more about it!
