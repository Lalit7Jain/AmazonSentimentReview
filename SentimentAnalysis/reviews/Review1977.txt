I had to call and cancel a domino's order cause the TV add where the guy says "Alexa..  Have dominoes order my easy order"...  Like that's all you have to say..  And if you have all that set up..  You WILL get a pizza.  You could change the activation word to echo I think.. But still very annoying if not genius source of generating extra money for both Amazon and dominos.
