I am finding it is an expensive radio, and alarm clock.  I connected it to my Pandora account, but it doesn't often work.  I ask " Alexa find me a station with 70's music " - she says " there are no stations that have 70's music ".  I ask " Alexa, I would like to hear some showtunes " She says 'I am unable to find showtunes music " Irate, I raise my voice and ask for " Broadway showtunes "....she replies, " Oh, you would like to hear showtunes radio "  UGH...Not as sophisticated as it should be.
