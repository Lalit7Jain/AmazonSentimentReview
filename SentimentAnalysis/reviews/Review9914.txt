A little about the unit itself.  The unit is very well built.  I weighs about 5 pounds.  I purchased a black one and the color coating shows no signs of inconsistency.  The volume ring is easy to turn but has that friction feel that comes in very expensive audio amplifiers.  Note: you can also ask Alexa to reduce the volume if you like.  The power cord connects inside the recessed bottom.  There is an opening allowing the cord to exit the base so the unit sits flat, but you cannot see where the power plugs in.  One of things I found nice is the lights used to show you whether Alexa is hearing you.  The light is a ring around the top.  As you speak to get Alexa's attention, the light rolls around that top ring.  The light highlights which microphone has your attention.  The spoken voice used is female and pleasant.  Alexa will repeat your request and continues to present it's findings.  It is neat to watch those lights circling the top of the unit.  You can change the unit's name to Echo or Amazon.  I am not sure if you can set up any other name.  I have not really done any research in that direction other than the setup manual.
