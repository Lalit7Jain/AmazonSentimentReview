3.  Setting up the music programs sucked. I ended up paying for Amazon Music Prime and becoming part of my family's Spotify family plan. This becomes obnoxious when I tell Alexa to play something, and she plays it from Amazon Music then I tell her to add it to a Spotify list and she can't. Another issue with it is that I'd like to be able to play any of my music from it. However, I can't play Pandora without also paying for that. I had not realized hwo restricted Echo would be when it came to music. I cannot play my 8tracks lists at all, and if I want to play the music that I own that wasn't purchased through Amazon, I'm going to have to sit down and load 20 gigs of songs up to the Amazon cloud.
