VERY DISAPPOINTED with this product.  I purchased the adjunct electrical plug to be able to turn lights on and off.  Unfortunately Echo tends to either say it can't find the device or just says okay but doesn't turn it on or off about 50% of the time.  The device works 100% of the time through the Kasa app.  The same thing happens to a playlist that I created for my wife.  Echo says it can't find it most of the time, but other times it finds it without a problem.  I AM EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED WITH THIS DEVICE.  IT IS VERY UNRELIABLE!
