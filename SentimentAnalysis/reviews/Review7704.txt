I love it! I asked Alexa to play Christmas songs by Pentatonix and then songs with only piano for a dinner party I gave...awesome. I've also asked her to order things from Amazon for me...amazing!!! The weather and my stock reports are great, and I've had her set a timer when I'm preparing food. The speaker is super, and volumes can be adjusted just by asking her to do it. Very impressive and now I'm ordering smart plugs so she can turn the lamps on and off for me. Did I say I love this thing?!!!!!
