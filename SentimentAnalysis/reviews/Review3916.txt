I just want a little more. I am sure with time it will become smarter and make my star rating go up. I feel that it should have some kind of internal memory or internal real time clock and not be totally dependent on internet connection. The device won't let you do anything if there is no internet connectivity, which includes easy task such as asking for the time, setting alarms, and setting up timers. I want more compatibility with Amazon Music Unlimited. I would like to add tracks to my playlists. I want to ask for a genre and I would like to receive options for different available playlist so that I may pick rather than have her pick for me. It seems she only knows two playlist, but if I were to search online for the same genre many playlist are available.
