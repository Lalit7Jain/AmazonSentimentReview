I am considering telling the person I bought it from to ask for a refund and to put that refund into their retirement. As someone who doesn't like to talk much, this product forces you to talk at all steps of the order. Personal problems aside, I am not sure this does much else than something like Siri, and besides having a pillar of 360 degree sound, I would say the only function is a way for amazon to accidentally make money off of children accidentally ordering things. There is a problem with echo for the reason that it cannot stream YouTube on command, instead you have to use websites or services partnered with amazon for this release. It lacks the capabilities it needs to be a great piece of technology. If I could rate it true to what I consider it to be, I would rate it 0 out of 5 stars because I cannot understand how anyone would think this could be worth more than $50.
