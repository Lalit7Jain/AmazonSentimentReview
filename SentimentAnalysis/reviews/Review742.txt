I've had this product for over a year and I do like it but...I think she definitely still needs some improvements.  She doesn't understand sometimes even when she prompts you to ask her things and then she doesn't understand the question.  The apps should be easier to use and she doesn't seem to work all the time for the past month Alexa has been unable to perform things like play music or answer a question many times. She's on my kitchen counter and I really love the idea of the product and she's great when she understands and is working properly.  Her lists and alarms are great, the music feature is awesome purchasing is awesome as long as she's able to complete the tasks.
