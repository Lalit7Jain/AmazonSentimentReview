"1","Love it. I don't like how my kids talk to her but I love having it!! Hands free!! I wish it was cordless.","Positive"
"2","Cool. Grandkids (five and seven) love it but sometimes they talk a little too fast to be understood.","Positive"
"3","This instrument might be the greatest thing since sliced bread, but the app makes it useless.  If you are lucky, it might recognize your password for your router, but it doesn't tell you.  Then the menus are dead ends, so you have to go back, and Amazon Music is the default!  About ready yo send it back and I have had it an our.  If you have Apple devices, look at the ratings for the app!","Positive"
"4","Love it  - Did not expect to !","Positive"
"5","The Echo is awesome. I cant wait to get connected devices light lights, thermostats, etc.... this thing is great. We use it all the time and have a lot of fun with it. Its actually quite surprising how well it does in taking commands and answering questions you would not expect it could ! I understand I can even have Alexa start my car now (note I don't think all manufacturers support yet) !","Positive"
"6","I liked this product while it lasted.  It has now gone dark and is unresponsive.  I tried unplugging it and plugging it back in, but alas.  She seems dead.","Negative"
"7","I received Alexa yesterday.  I was so excited to begin using the music app......","Positive"
"8","I think I have put in over 2 hours trying to make this work.","Positive"
"9","I will try to get help but may have to send it back....sorry to say.","Negative"
"10","I've forgotten what life before Alexa was like.  I love it.  Every morning I wake up and listen to my flash news briefing.  It was changed my life for the better!  I'm excited to see what future developments hold for this product.","Positive"
"11","I purchased this mainly to listen to music but I have found myself doing SO much more with it.  It plays games, turns off lights, plays OCEAN WAVES or RAIN - THIS IS GREAT!!!!  My mother was over and is purchasing her one as we speak!","Positive"
"12","AWESOME INVENTION I USE EVERY DAY ALONG WITH THE DOTS","Positive"
"13","More amazing.  The perfect ""Christmas gift for special people.","Positive"
"14","After purchasing the Amazon Echo I became very frustrated.  I am now unhappy that everything else in my life isn't voice activated!!!  I have told everyone I know how great this product is.  Well done Amazon!","Negative"
"15","On a serious note, I have caught myself starting to speak commands to other appliances, only to catch myself and realizing I have to actually pick up the remote to control them.  How barbaric!  lol","Negative"
"16","I would have given it 5 stars except for one maddening fault. When you tell it to turn on or off a device it  ALWAYS says ""I found multiple devices with that name. Which device did you mean?"" after witch you repeat exactly what you said the first time and it does what you asked. If it at least let you repeat the device name before it finished it wouldn't be so bad, but after 100 times it still always asks for the device name again and it gets extremely frustrating!!!!","Negative"
"17","love it","Positive"
"18","I absolutely love the Echo. At first I didn't think I would use it for anything other than music but I have been using it for everything from news updates and alarms to games, podcasts and my smart devices. The sound is excellent. I've recommended this to everyone in my family.","Positive"
"19","Love Amazon Echo!  This little tower can really do so many things.  I personally love being able to turn on and off the lights with just a simple command.  My only complaint is I ordered the gift wrap as it was a gift for my husband and it was stuffed into a skin tight bag that I could not seal.  Very disappointed I spent money on wrapping it when in the end I had to wrap it myself to keep it a surprise.","Positive"
"20","Great fun for the family.  Speaker sounds decent and Alexa has smart technology so she learns. It's great to have a question and be able to ask it without grabbing your phone or computer. ""Alexa how do you spell....?"" or ""Alexa what's the weather tomorrow?""","Positive"
"21","Nothing but fun fun fun!!!!!","Positive"
"22","The best speaker Iv'e bought so far! It beats Google Home in every way as I bought both devices. The amazon echo is accurate and superb in sound! It won't let you down! Highly recommended! :)","Positive"
"23","Its amazing what it can do and its very helpful and it can tell you jokes lol","Positive"
"24","I'm also adding a battery base to it to make it portable. :)","Positive"
"25","*** The things I feel like could be added to the amazon echo would be other custom names instead of amazon, alexa and echo. Also a speakerphone for conversations such as phone calls. If these features could be added, then this would be the ultimate device! :D","Positive"
"26","Very impressed. I bought a factory refurbished unit, and it functions perfectly and looks nice.  Lots of fun.","Positive"
"27","OK, keeping this brief, because I love my Echo, though I've not explored it's abilities as much as I should be.  As I am about to buy a Tap and a Dot, I wanted to make Amazon aware of the following review, in hopes that they will investigate work to resolve the claims made in the article below...I finished it feeling as though the gentleman was paid by Google, but I also know some of his claims are valid...I hope Amazon is able to move the next step forward to continue improving a great product.","Positive"
"28","I use the echo mostly for listening to prime music and getting my daily flash news briefing. The kids have some fun asking her silly questions and to tell jokes. It gives a nice sound and can play at a loud volume without distorting the sound. It's also handy for giving weather reports and traffic updates.","Positive"
"29","Only leaving 4 instead of 5 stars due to when she's playing anything over volume 5 she doesn't respond to her name and needs to have you walk over and push her action button to get her attention. Superb sound, nice features.  Just improve her response rate and make her a little smarter for general questions and she would be a 10 rating.","Positive"
"30","Alexa is about as helpful as Siri, which is not much.  She rarely hears my requests correctly and has little capabilities beyond what my iPhone can do.","Positive"
"31","I'm not sure how I ever lived without Alexa. The echo is so useful, especially for children who haven't yet learned to read/write, tell time, etc., or elderly who have difficulty with new tech. Just set up the Echo and everyone can use it.","Negative"
"32","really struggles with language. many struggles getting espn westwood one radio tonight to listen to packer game. What is the answer?","Negative"
"33","So far so good. Still learning the proper commands and all, but def like it.","Positive"
"34","We use Alexa every day. It's fun and the kids love it.","Positive"
"35","good toy","Positive"
"36","I have only had the device for a day and am having fun with it.  I am considering returning it though because reminders are just added to a list. It is handy to be able to ask her to remind you to do a task at a certain time, but if you have to remember to check a list it defeats the purpose!  A fun little gadget, but almost useless as an assistant and maybe not worth the price.","Positive"
"37","Too much work setting up. I'd probably rarely use it.","Positive"
"38","Ordered it after reading reviews on the internet. Was not disappointed.  It does all it says it can with minimal trouble. Just wish it covered Nascar in the sports section. I would recommend it to my friends.","Negative"
"39","Fairly useful except the main thing I used it for, to play my music back randomly, didn't work. Amazon's communication about this flaw was one-sided, unclear, and not useful. I hope Amazon can fix the issue.","Negative"
"40","I love Alexa","Positive"
"41","Oh Alexa what would I ever do with out you! My hubby travels all the time for work and she's kinda like my friend ( sad I know) I tell her good morning everyday and she say Good Morning and tells me a fact for the day! She also tells me to have sweet dreams at night!","Positive"
"42"," Makes ordering way to easy! Good thing my 4 yr old has not figured out how to order but you can set up a password for orders.  She's kinda funny she's a member of our family now!","Positive"
"43","Works great. Can't for the updates that will make it more knowledgeable.","Positive"
"44","  My dog is hilarious when I have her open a box of cats! IF YOU HAVE A DOG TRY IT!!!!!! It's funny.","Positive"
"45","  Annnnnd there's a finding Dory alarm I have set every am for when my son has to get ready for school. It's a life saver he drops what he is doing and goes to brush his teeth and hair get shoes on back pack!","Positive"
"46"," Alexa is awesome!!","Positive"
"47","Still getting use to talking out loud to a machine, wife hates it. It has so many functions that you really need to search the internet to learn them and do a periodic check since they add new functions on an extremely regular basis. I use it to get a weather report and news report while making coffee. I also am now using it as a cooking timer when I have more then one item that needs timed. I am a novice user, I recommend you do a bit of research prior to ordering to see the thousands of things you can do with it and see if it will work for you. I give it 4 stores since it started playing hardcore RAP music while my mother was visiting scaring the daylights out of her and my wife since it was so late and neither one had used the ""ALEXA"" keyword to when I checked the recording on the Alexa APP to see what hard started the music. This furthermore made my wife hate it. It is fun to listen to the older commands on the APP when you are not home. I had quite a laugh listening to my wife ask Alexa how much she cost trying to learn more about it and give me grief is my guess. Alexa at least didn't tell on me!","Positive"
"48","Breathes there a man with a soul so dead,","Positive"
"49","I purchased as a gift for someone and he loves it!","Positive"
"50","The basic function of Alexa is very good, that is playing music, telling time, setting timers and such. But it seems that almost every functional thing beyond the basics requires a smart phone or Android device of the latest OS or Apple and they have to be got from third parties through Google Play or Apple.  My problem is I don't have a smart phone and my Android device isn't of the needed vintage.","Positive"
"51","I showed my wife the commercial for it right before it was released. She isn't super tech savvy and didn't really see the point. She surprised me when she got me one for our anniversary. We set it up in the kitchen and use it every. single. day. Now there is constantly music playing in our kitchen instead of having to stick a phone into a docking station.  Love that it syncs with Pandora and I honestly would never use my prime music account without it. I am notorious for not putting things I use the last of on the grocery list. Not anymore!  Kitchen timers, news briefs, the kids LOVE asking her to tell jokes. I also love that it is open sourced and constantly evolving. We use her to control our Hue lighting system and have several wemo switches now. Looking forward to adding a Nest thermostat in the near future.","Positive"
"52","I love my echo.","Positive"
"53","I used to have Alexa in the house. Then figured out that having it in the garage is much better since i can leave it up high enough and out of the way when working, and no need for a larger radio or having to use bluetooth all,the time with a smaller speaker.","Positive"
"54","I got mine when they first came out when i had to sign up to get one, as a prime member i paid 99 dollars and have never had a problem. Great device. Looking to get a few dots for around the house.","Positive"
"55","Worst thing I have ever purchased from Amazon.  It has never worked longer than one hour continuously.  Usually stays on anywhere from 5 minutes to 10 minutes than goes off line and has to be rebooted.  It did not work properly when I first took it out of the box.  After three days with three different customer service and tech people, it stayed on for almost an hour.  I have moved it three times to get it ever closer to the wifi. I have rebooted and reinstalled it at least twelve times.  I was gone for three weeks and unplugged it in my absence in the hope that it might work when I returned and that was the final move, closest to the wifi.  It has been worse.  Today in frustration, I again called customer service and spent about 30 minutes with someone that kept telling me he would fix my problem.  I finally had to ask how he was going to do that when everyone else had failed.  Turned out he was just saying it to fill time while we waited for Alexa to YET AGAIN reboot.  I was asked to go get another power source and try that.  I had to share that I have not additional power sources for Alexa nor should I have to have one.  After the reboot and the half hour and a call back 15 minutes later, Alexa managed to stay on for 20 minutes.  This is the biggest waste of money and no one at Amazon seems to know how to fix the ones, like mine, that do not work.","Negative"
"56","Love it","Positive"
"57","Awesome product a must for any home.","Positive"
"58","Grear sound, easy setup up!","Positive"
"59","Fortunately, Amazon has an app for PCs which allows me to add the book reading function by clicking on the book to be read, but it requires me to turn on the PC - which I'd have to do with all the other devices, too.  The smart phones, of course would usually be on for texting and other such time wasters.","Positive"
"60","Every time you loose internet/wifi, the echo is a beeatch to get reconnected. I have two of them and I hate the set up","Negative"
"61","time I have to kill everytime. I almost tossed both of them in the fire this morning, Next time wont be almost.","Negative"
"62","I am very happy with Amazon Echo, it works as I expected and I have found it to be great when I need to set a timer in my kitchen or ask for recipes, and ordering Items from Amazon.","Positive"
"63","Love it.  Hardly pick up my phone at home anymore and I live through my phone.  I turned my house inyo a smart home.  My girlfriend loves to leave lights on.  I can turn any light off through echo","Positive"
"64","My 73 year old parents LOVE IT!!!! Gave it to them as an early Christmas present and they use it all the time. Two of my brothers order one after seeing it! Easy to set up and use.","Positive"
"65","Ummm yes everyone needs one! Just do it...it will not disappoint.","Negative"
"66","Very useful. I like this so much I bought another. And then I bough an echo dot. and then I got my mother and my in-laws one. I should own Amazon stock.","Positive"
"67","Great product. Just as advertised.","Positive"
"68","Awesome. Bought as a gift . My husband loves this thing and the sound and operation is AWESOME. Easy connectivity.","Positive"
"69","I wish I had purchased it sooner. Definitely will purchase a few more for the relatives. It truly did it all with ease. Paired with the alexa app, it's so easy to use","Positive"
"70","Using items like smart outlets, which is what I wanted for my hospice patient wife, at the moment, is impossible because I have to create another account for the devices, and they only accept input from there app on a smart phone.  Without that, Alexa will neither find it nor operate it.","Positive"
"71","This is one of the most intuitive items I have used in a long wile. The voice UI is close to spot-on, for me better than Siri and Okay Google on my smartphones. I can even give a command from about >20 feet away in the other room. Although it seems to struggle with the volume up above six (6) hearing me from farther away making it hard to turn down the volume from the other room. I would have not only given this five stars but I would have purchased several more if they would connect giving me music throughout the home/patio. This one device playing at a time just seems like a waste of good technology.","Positive"
"72","We love it great little helper","Positive"
"73","It's just a OK device and don't get fooled by all the hypes.  The search is very awkward and too limited.  In order to find any meaningful result, you have to say wikipedia +""question"". When search a song, it also just pulls up from Amazon.  I will give Google Home a try and heard that the search is far better and natural.","Positive"
"74","I love the fact that I can speak to Alexa and add grocery lists, turn on music, etc.","Positive"
"75","I love my echo when im getting dressed in the morning it tells me the weather and then plays my favorite songs to start my day.","Positive"
"76","Bought as gift for sister.  She LOVES it, One was given to my son as a gift, he LOVES it.  So I went ahead and bought three more.  The white for my sister's BDAY, and two more(purchase limit) on Black Friday for xmas gifts!! Does too much to list, you have to see it your self. Just buy it...the guy at Best Buy told me they had a demo for Google one, and it wasn't as great. I also do not like the look of the new Google one anyway.  (FYI-- you can listen to itunes through this, just need to use it as a bluetooth speaker, and stream through it that way, can use ""Alexa Pause and Alexa skip"" with that only)","Positive"
"77","Echo comes out of the box just waiting to be amazing. You start by plugging it in, and from there you get instructions from Alexa on how to pair with your internet. Download the Echo app and you're off. So far, the voice recognition is spot on. There aren't many instances where she hasn't understood what I was asking for. If you have your music REALLY loud, sometimes you need to raise your voice to her, but she can still hear you.","Negative"
"78","Where she really shines is her integration with Spotify, Pandora and TuneIn. After linking these services, all you have to do is ask for a song or playlist from your service and she gets it for you. Her accuracy with spotify so far for me is about 80%. Sometimes she will say that she can't find a certain song, but if you get more specific with your request, she will find it. Where she starts to have trouble is with little kid voices. My kids (7,3) love using it, but she has a hard time understanding them sometimes. Once they slow down and speak clearly, it works just fine.","Positive"
"79","Overall this is an amazing gadget with a thousand uses. From music, to sports scores, to weather, to the news. She can do just about anything. Then if you have Nest, or Hue products..she can control your smart home too!","Positive"
"80","Love this. Great gift","Positive"
"81","I'll keep the Alexa,  much disappointmented, but I'll return the outlets as unusable because I am not investing in a smart phone.","Positive"
"82","My kids love it. I like the convenience of just asking it to play pandora when I sit down to do my art and not fumble with the switches when my wife yells something from the lower floor of the house.","Positive"
"83","I bought this for a Bluetooth speaker.  I have a couple of Bluetooth speakers that really aren't very loud and are hard to pair.  This is very satisfactory in both regards.  It pairs easily with my Android phone and plays at a good volume.  Yesterday I was listening to Pandora and actually had to say, ""Alexa, reduce volume."" The volume reduction was immediate and met my requirements.  I haven't used many of the features  beyond Bluetooth, but when I asked for news, I got a five minute news report from my favorite station, so that was very cool.  It is rather pricey, but so far it has been a good addition to my life.  It is portable enough to take from the kitchen to the bedroom (I got the battery base).  Next I want to try bringing it in the car.  My car will pair with my phone, but I can't use voice control to ask for my Audible book or etc.","Positive"
"84","Pros:","Positive"
"85","1. The setup and use of this device is as easy as any wifi integrated electronic equipment; easier, in fact.  The Bluetooth connect procedure is a bit trickier, but only slightly.","Positive"
"86","2. Voice recognition is superb.","Positive"
"87","3. Basic voice command functions are incredibly simple (e.g. Weather, Smarthome devices, specific music requests, volume control, etc.).","Positive"
"88","4. Aesthetically compatible in any room.","Positive"
"89","Cons:","Negative"
"90","1.  As an audiophile, I can only say that the sound quality is passable, but by no means is it on par with Bose or Klipsch minispeaker systems.  DO NOT let this put you off of the Echo.  It is not bad at all for ambient music, but it won't be your go-to for party music.  My wife uses the Echo exclusively.  She's perfectly happy with the audio quality and methods to choose what she wants to listen to.","Positive"
"91","2. When music is playing, getting Alexa to wake up is very intermittent.  Doesn't  seem to discriminate voice from music well at all.","Negative"
"92","I've decided to chuck both the smart switch and Alexa, both require too much and return too little.  One shouldn't have to have a handful of devices to make Alexa smart enough to do its duty (I refuse to humanize a barely functional machine).  I bought them to comfort my wife in hospice by playing music and reading her Kindle books, but she's gone now and the machine was no help at all - due to the ridiculous, designed in constraints that refused to even read a bought and paid for book from Amazon or turn a light on and off without first having a smart phone or the proper Android OS.","Positive"
"93","3. The folks at Amazon are always working to improve functionality, and that is a good thing.  A lot of questions we've posed simply are out of the realm and reach of the search engine's capability.  In other words, don't try a lot of AND or OR discrete searches.  This does seem to be improving, but it is currently the Achilles heel for now.","Positive"
"94","4.  Items 1-3 above are not major issues that would cost the review more than one star combined.  The fact that I cannot connect the output from the Echo to my Bluetooth audio receiver, however, is a full star deduction.  Seems intuitive that the unit should have both transmit and receive functions at this price point.","Positive"
"95","All of this said, I really like the Echo for what it is.  I would recommend this as a great gift for that person on your gift list who is not a discerning audio snob and who is someone that appreciates the simplicity of a true plug and play device.","Positive"
"96","Amazing.","Positive"
"97","Love Echo.  Cool item to build your lifestyle around overall.  Now, Amazon just need to sync to youtube","Positive"
"98","Amazing device.  My wife and I are enjoying learning all Alexa can do","Positive"
"99","I have a love-hate relationship with Alexa.","Positive"
"100","The product itself is superb and even better that it was a refurb.","Positive"
"101","The concept of Alexa is fantastic but it's execution is lacking and still very much in the infant stage.","Negative"
"102","We love it!! Just got it today and Alexa is playing all our request. Very happy so far","Positive"
"103","I purchased an Echo about 6 months ago. As with any tech purchase I was very excited to receive my new echo but the excitement was short lived. I have a speech impairment so I expected with any voice recognition software to have to learn my speech pattern; I thought there would be a paragraph that a person has to read 3 or 4 times for the software to learn your speech pattern, but there wasn't. There isn't any set-up for the voice recognition software so it just arbitrarily dismissed me.","Positive"
"104","Rarely do I need Alexa to tell me a joke or a specific one-liner.","Positive"
"105","I want to ask Alexa complex questions and have her find me the answer or have a dialogue with me to find what I'm looking for.","Negative"
"106","Her ability to read Wikipedia is lacking.","Negative"
"107","I want something as simple as telling Alexa to remember my birthday and store it in her database of useful facts for me.  I want to tell her the birthday of my wife and to record that she likes a certain type of flowers.  Then as it gets closer, I want to ask Alexa if she has any deals for me relating to birthday gifts for my wife and I want Alexa to offer to buy flowers for my wife.  That's what a personal assistant does.","Positive"
"108","Alexa is still so lacking in the ""if this, then that"" field.  The bright side?  She plays music and emails my wife recipes from the Food Channel.","Negative"
"109","Love love it!","Positive"
"110","I absolutely love my Amazon Echo. From Music to sports updates to my audible books to the alarm.  I deliberated for 3 months or more on whether I thought it would be worth the price.  I got a black Friday deal, but would even buy it over again at full price.  I love Alexa!","Positive"
"111","Love Echo.  Does everything as promised.","Positive"
"112","Siri has a small amount of personality , this does not. Other than playing music and giving you the weather this is a dumb piece of","Positive"
"113","And since it was past the time limit to return I now have a $139 paperweight. Thanks Amazon","Negative"
"114","I love this item!!! Would buy it again ;-)","Positive"
"115","If you are thinking about buying just do it. It took 30 minutes for me to fall in love with this. The speaker is amazing for music, Alexa has so many features, and I am excited for more things to be added. I look forward to using this over the next months.","Positive"
"116","Easily one of my favorite tech purchases EVER and I just bought two more. The voice recognition and command system is far beyond anything Apple or Google has put forward. Nearly all the house guests who have witnessed us nonchalantly telling Alexa to turn the music down, play a specific song, or ask a general question are in awe and almost immediately commit to buying one themselves.","Positive"
"117","did not work with my router spent hours with support to try and fix. They could not fix it.","Positive"
"118","Well.. it's alright device. I'm considering returning it and then 4 Dots I have simply because I have to return and rebuy the echo to get $40 back. I even said I'd take Amazon credit was told only $20. Once I was escalated, the manager said that by taking to him the $20 gift card offer was no longer valid and told me I was out of luck and go ahead and return.","Positive"
"119","Really want to see a better search feature.","Positive"
"120","I bought this thing in Feb 2015, never even bothered to plug it in until November 2015 when it became compatible with my Smartthings Hub. I used it a few times a day for random things (music, alarms, weather, etc). At the beginning of November 2016 it worked fine one day in the morning and later that night it was dead. No lights, no response, nothing. Amazon sent me a replacement ac adapter because apparently their early models were shipped with defective adapters. Still didn't work. Tech support said it was out of warranty but they could offer me a ""special"" price to replace it. That price was the same price listed on the website for everyone to purchase. How was this ""special""?","Positive"
"121","The echo was great when it worked, but I'd expect it to last longer than a year of use. I won't be buying a replacement... especially at the ""special"" price.","Positive"
"122","I really like my White Amazon Echo, it sounds great, it looks great, and it seems to have a really nice solid high quality build with really nice buttons and the top turns with a satisfying amount of resistance. I took down 1 Star because a lot of the questions I ask, it doesn't know the answer to, but I think that will be fixed over time as more and mor epeople use the service. I would definitely would recommend this to a family member or a friend. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!","Positive"
"123","Great product","Positive"
"124","It's okay but doesn't understand many questions asked of it. Unfortunately it died after seven months.","Negative"
"125","Our new best friend Alexa is as fun to have around while she's being so darn handy. From music to weather and scores and recipes. Haven't tried any others like this in the market so I can't compare her to the google one but I can say she's better than Siri. Understands me and my boyfriend easily and goes well with the app.","Positive"
"126","work like a charm easy install and reponds great to commands","Positive"
"127","I freaking LOVE this thing. Now to get a couple Dots to go with it.","Positive"
"128","We've loved our echo ever since we've gotten it.","Positive"
"129","We are having a lot of fun with it.  Our son set it up for us.","Positive"
"130","I love Alexa my only issue is I can't remember what each launch fraize to use for what skill.....how is this resolved....I have stop and look on the app.....kinda defeats the purpose....????  Maybe in the future she will be more adaptable to questions kinda like google is.....  I have to say I do plan on purchasing the Dot to put in my bedroom.  There has been so many times this past year I wanted to add to my shopping list or to do list or play this etc... and  I found myself say Alexa...but she is in the living room and can't hear me....LOL","Positive"
"131","Good for music and simple questions.","Positive"
"132","The Iphone Ap didn't contact or set the Alexa up correctly.  Difficult interface made it too much trouble to use.","Negative"
"133","Amazing device!!! I love it!","Positive"
"134","Per my boyfriend, ""Alexa is my new girlfriend."" We have yet to tap into all her utility, but so far she's been a great companion to friend's child by answering questions, my boyfriend and me by settling arguments via fact checking, picking playlists based on what I announce my mood to be, and informing me of the weather as I am rushing around in the morning getting ready for work. I can't wait to work through all other functions.","Positive"
"135","Best purchase I made all year!","Positive"
"136","I purchased an Echo when it was only available to Prime Members.  It has improved over the years to a fully functional assistant.  I use it so much, I purchased a second one for my office.  I always think I am going to remember something but then I don't.  Why don't I just use Outlook to organize?  Because it just seems like so much work and sticky notes just get gone.  I just add a reminder to my to do list or calendar and let Alexa take care of the rest.  I don't use my Echo to its full potential but she keeps my calendar, reminders, grocery list.  She impresses co-workers with her ability to answer a question pretty efficiently.  She turns the lights out when I'm to lazy to get up and turns them on when I leave during the day and get back after dark.  She reads to me from my Audible account.  I use her to place orders.  Okay, I am a little lazy, Echo just makes it less obvious to others.","Positive"
"137","What can I say that hasn't been said about the Amazon Echo. It is an awesome product, I use it in everyday life from playing music to controlling my smart home devices in my home. I even won over my wife and she loves it. The seven microphones can pick up my voice across my entire home. Its tied directly into my home automation system and combine with IFTTT the possibilities are endless.","Positive"
"138","Great Product 5 Stars","Positive"
"139","Love this product!! So many uses and always coming out with new things you can use it for. I started out with just the Eco and now have 5 or 6 different lights amd other items I can control through it. I recommend getting Amazon Prime and it opens up a whole new side of the Eco.","Positive"
"140","I have both a dot and an echo and they are just fantastic. Its creepy awesome how you can just a question out of rhe blue or have a song in your head and within seconds Alexa is there. The Exho has a full sound it doesnt take up space Its crazy awesome","Positive"
"141","I just received my Echo today and I already am in love, 5 stars for one of the most interesting technical parts of my life. It plays your music, it can read you books. It answers any question at all you have for it. It  will update you on all your favorite sports teams. It sets alarms and timers for you. It will add things to your shopping list as you think of it. It will add things to your calendar as you think of it. It even can operate things in your home like your smart thermostat or the lights in your home. There isn't much it cannot do. She is awesome!!","Positive"
"142","I love Alexa and I'm very happy with the Echo.  I do wish it was wireless though","Positive"
"143","I got my Echo today, and it's safe to say that I'm in love. For starters, Alexa is a Monty Python fan, because when I asked her, ""What's the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?"" ... well, she knew the right answer. She plays my favorite music, even making suggestions that are dead on. She knows the time, the weather, celsius to fahrenheit conversions ... and she'll wake me up from a nap, take dictation (shopping list and to-do list), keep track of my calendar, adjust my Nest thermostat and my Phillips Hue lights, and order me a pizza. She'll also bark at my dog (on command) and play music from my iPhone via Bluetooth.","Positive"
"144","Bought this one for a neighbour because we were so impressed with ours.","Positive"
"145","And that brings me to the sound from this smaller-than-expected device: It's unbelievable. I have AudioEngine bookshelf speakers that are pretty darned good, but the Echo shames them. What a robust sound! I'm seriously blown away.","Positive"
"146","So, yeah, get thee an Echo. You won't be disappointed.","Negative"
"147","AMAZON CUSTOMER SERICE is HORRIBLE!  I have speaking to a customer service rep for over 30 minutes and he seems clueless as to how to help me with what should be a relatively easy inquiry.  I bought an AMAZON ECHO as a gift last week and noticed that it went on sale days after my purchase and I called to ask if they could provide a credit for the $40.00 difference.  I was told by the young man ( who had difficulty communicating ) that it would be best if I returned the one purchased and buy it again with the sale price.  REALLY it was a gift and I am not willing to ask the recipient of the gift to give it back.  What?  C'mon Amazon I am a Prime Member and this is the best solution you got?  By the way I am still on hold while he tries to find his supervisor.  It is now over 45 minutes...50 MINUTES AND COUNTING...NOW over an hour...UNACCEPTABLE","Positive"
"148","I enjoy the Echo but you put it on sale 5 days after I bought it.  As a Prime member I wish I had been made aware of this.  Disappointed in Amazon.","Positive"
"149","This thing is pretty neat. It comes in handy turns off my lights. My favorite thing that it does it's turns on my bathroom heater in the morning not having to go into a cold bathroom first thing in the morning is priceless.","Positive"
"150","I have now tried twice to have Amazon replace this defective unit (it repeatedly goes mute - no sound output at all), and twice the customer service reps have said something to the effect of, ""Reset the device, and I'll call you back tomorrow to see how things are."" Amazon never calls back, and my device is still defective. The second CSR even acknowledged that the first CSR should have called back, since they have record of the first call in their files. Then, he left me hanging just like the first.","Negative"
"151","I'd love to 5-star this, but customer service has left a bad taste in my mouth. If you get a working unit, good for you. If you've got a defective one like me, good luck.","Positive"
"152","I wish I hadn't purchased this. The only thing Alexa seems to do for us is tell a joke or the weather. Half the time she doesn't understand what we're asking or refers us to the app. I added things on the app and she still doesn't recognize what I'm asking. I don't know what people use this for other than smart home devices which we don't currently have.","Positive"
"153","got it with the 5 payment option...good product","Positive"
"154","Love the amazon echo. Family is already enjoying it.","Positive"
"155","Enjoy learning with it!","Positive"
"156","Love it... Will order another for my downstairs.","Positive"
"157","I wish Alexa had a little bit more AI and be more conversational.  The skills are great but I sometimes forget the ""catch phrase"".  I also hope there are more settings for traffic report for work.  I use non toll roads and Alexa only gives me fastest route.  Otherwise, I find Alexa to be an eye opener to making my home smart.","Positive"
"158","I've only had it one day and already love it! This morning I checked my calendar, weather, set an alarm, listened to jokes, made a to-do list, a shopping list, and listened to my favorite music all through simple voice commands! (and with out leaving my cozy bed LOL!!!!) Only complaint is that I had to order a battery pack separate or you need to have it plugged in 24/7. Also, I have not learned all the features yet, but once this connects to your phone (text, read emails, and make calls) everyone will want one!","Positive"
"159","OMG... how did we get along without Alexa? She is so helpful (and at times so funny). She tells us the weather for the day and the week ahead. She answers questions that frequently pop into our heads (i.e. Alexa, when did So-and-So die? Alexa, what is the capital city of ....?). She orders items from Amazon when we realize we need a replacement. She plays our Prime music for us and her speakers are great. She gives us information on restaurants, etc. She even says good-night to us... haha. She'll sing, tell jokes and give us the news of the day in our Flash Briefing. I cannot imagine life without our Echo. Recently we bought the Dot to go in our family room downstairs... that's how much we love these devices.","Positive"
"160","i can't say anything about this as of yet because it is for a christmas gift. i know my son has one and enjoys it so i am hoping my husband will enjoy it when he gets it.","Positive"
"161","Wonderful item. She can be stubborn sometimes. Or maybe I don't say it correctly-LOL!! We get along pretty well though. I'm liking the Christmas music she plays. And the jokes are fun for my grandkids. This is a very clever thing and I enjoy Alexa alot.","Positive"
"162","Well, I thought that it would speak to me when I need it to remind me of appointments!  I guess I really don't know how to use it, & need some structural advice by a real person!  I purchased it so that it could help my husband who had several strokes by reminding him of thing of importance!  Clearly I need help learning how to operate this wonderful gadget!","Positive"
"163","You can ask it almost anything, sounds great","Positive"
"164","Arrived really fast, was going to gift it to myself for Christmas but I couldn't resist. Easy set up, Alexa picks up your voice easily and the speaker sounds really nice. Only downfall would be the app, it often crashes and I find myself having to close it and reopen it just to change a song on my phone sometimes, it doesn't affect the device one bit as you can easily do that with voice control, but just thought that I'd mention that. Other than that, I love my Echo!","Positive"
"165","Love Amazon White","Positive"
"166","Absolutely adorable and very soft and cuddly. Very very happy with this purchase.","Positive"
"167","With so many wonderful reviews, we thought we'd give this a try. We were disappointed in that it ended up sitting idle most of the time. It would be great for a single person but we found it lacking for a family with kids.","Positive"
"168","We got Echo primarily to listen to music. We got the 30 day unlimited trial but:","Positive"
"169","2) When she understood us, she often came up with a cover version of the song and not the most popular version. You have to know both the name of the song and the artist to get the song you want.","Positive"
"170","3) If you ask to play music by an artist, she plays all the songs randomly, regardless of popularity. So you hear a lot of what you don't want to hear.","Negative"
"171","4) There is no way to get just the clean versions of the songs. Too many songs popular on the radio have explicit versions as their album versions and that is what you'll get. This alone was a non-starter for us.","Positive"
"172","We have a WeMo controlled light, and that was fun to turn on by voice, but not convenient enough to get the Echo for. Granted if we have more, it might have been more valuable. We were debating to get more WeMo/Philips Hue but decided it was more of a gimmick and often confusing to those who just wanted to turn lights on by the switch.","Positive"
"173","The games for our kids were awful. We tried 20 questions and an animal game and a few math games. The interaction is awkward as Alexa is always in a rush and the whole household has to be quiet or she'll interpret the noise as an answer and move on. With two kids, one just has to be very quiet so one's answer doesn't mess up the other's game. She was equally terrible with the few math games we tried as she'd often not hear the correct answer correctly, tell the kid they were wrong, and then the kid's confused as to what the right answer is as they can't figure out what the right answer is (given they were just told the right answer was wrong.)","Positive"
"174","Lot of fun @ informative","Positive"
"175","Alexa is not conversational. If you ask her something, you have to repeat it in any follow up. For example, we asked if the library was open and she (incredibly!) told us the right answer. You can't just say ""Alexa, how do we get there"" as she won't know what there is. We'd have to say ""Alexa, give us directions to the Anytown USA Library"".","Positive"
"176","Overall we found this not very useful and the fun things were more than offset by the frustrating things. I'm thinking of getting a DOT as it is most of the functionality for a fraction of the cost, so maybe it could be worth it (just to turn on the lights, say, and to have some access to the Echo deals) but we are returning our Echo","Positive"
"177","This echo needs wifi to work and needs to be plugged in at all times. It may also connect to a phone through bluetooth for general audio but the true features come through syncing your devices' apps to the echo through wifi. AleXA sets my alarms and is a good listener. I don't have wifi outlets yet to use her to turn my home appliances and lights on or off but I might buy some once the technology gets better for those plugs. I'm happy with alexa and she can be very hilarious to chat with aND ask questions to.  Sometimes I have to yell at her to be quiet cuz no one was talking to her and she's giving random history facts but that only happened one really convenient (funny) time in a conversation with my husband.","Positive"
"178","Wish it was as cool as UE boom/megaboom but it doesn't have the durability or portableness. Very stationary,  find an open spot in your home, don't put her on a book case, she needs to be able to pick up the voice from 360 degrees around.","Positive"
"179","Echo has cool sound and I love having it all the way up in my apartment during the day. Shakes the ground so keep it at volume 6 or less for nightime use out of respect for apartment peeps. 7 or higher when you're home alone or during the day, no one will mind as much. Great for music lovers who like to dance to a heavy beat or sing along loudly!!","Positive"
"180","I wish alexa could find a lost phone in the house by either pinpointing the wifi signal or telling her,  verbally where you're moving the phone?","Negative"
"181","Alexa is an absolute must have! My children and I are very impressed with this product. I wake up to the children asking ""Alexa what is...?"" Or ""Alexa, how do I...?"", ""Alex, play a game"",  ""Alexa, tell me a joke"", ""Alexa, set an alarm"",  ""Alexa, play music.""  This is only the tip of the iceberg of what Echo is capable of. She can read you books and when linked to other devices, she can turn on and off devices. The speaker system on this is impressive, and I absolutely recommend the Echo.","Positive"
"182","  My children love it so much, that I am getting the Dots for their rooms. They don't need the loud speaker that the Echo provides for their rooms. With the Dot, they will be able to enjoy the other functions of their very own Alexa in their own rooms. Such a fun gift and learning tool for  children. They are 10 and 13 and have no shortage of questions. LOL","Positive"
"183","Loving this device so far! it as exceeded my exceptions by far! so happy with it! way worth the investment.","Positive"
"184","This Speaker and its uses are endless, great product","Positive"
"185","good product, I do have some questions about privacy in regards to this device. I would think Amazon would advise purchasers of this product about the privacy issues.","Negative"
"186","Not great outside of the US.  Doesn't use GPS so you need a zip code.  None available in HK so the use of the device is limited.  In the US this thing must be great!","Positive"
"187","Good speaker. Very sleek look. She has room to","Positive"
"188","improve as far as doing what you ask but I'm sure that will get better the more she is used and with updates.","Positive"
"189","Alexa, I love you!!  She is wonderful!  She makes our shopping list, plays Christmas music, tells us the score of the Eagles game,  orders items off Amazon, tells us if we need our umbrella,  tells us the best route to our destination and even does the dishes!  OK we haven't taught Alexa that yet but we're getting there!!  We love her and put Dots all over the house in the bedrooms!!  Falling asleep with Alexa is wonderful, she even wakes us up in the morning!  We love you Alexa xxxooo","Positive"
"190","I didn't realize what I was buying when I bought it. I just wanted a Bluetooth speaker, but it's WAY more! Alexa is almost like having an assistant in my kitchen! I can look up over temperature million songs with my amazon music. I just ask and it plays. This thing is great.One note: you have to keep this item plugged in or purchase the base for portability at almost $50.00.","Positive"
"191","LOVE IT!!!!!!!","Positive"
"192","I have an Echo Dot and bought the Big Echo because of the sea price and also I needed built in sound.. the Echo has fabulous sound!!  I play a variety of music from Country to Smooth jazz and this echo has fantastic sound!  I set it up in my living room and it it fills the Kitchen and dining room with beautiful sound.. thats about 950sq/ft.. if you have high ceilings and more than 1000 sq ft.. then you may need a higher powered speaker system.  If you already have a good system that can connect with Bluetooth then thats the way to go.. I love the sound quality.. I listened to many BT speakers to see if there was another that I would like better.. reality is.. for the money the Echo is fantastic!!  If the echo isn't enough then you need to connect to a high end stereo or Home theater system.  I have a 7.1 sound bar for my 4k TV and the Echo sounds better alone than when I connect it to play through the sound bar..  It wont get as loud as my 700 watt system  but the quality is better from the internal speakers.. If I have a party then I will go for the higher volume in on the sound bar.. but let me tell you.. I listened to Sonos..he JBL the BOSE... and it only the BOSE came close to the built in sound quality of the echo!  I would have to spend another $200 to get just a little better than what echo delivers!  Try it for yourself!  You can always return it.. I doubt you will !!  I am giving this as a gift to all my friends for Christmas.. they will love it.. I will get one for my office as well..  I hope they keep expanding the capabilities !!","Positive"
"193","LOVE THIS!!! My new best friend!!!","Positive"
"194","Even when using in Russia echo feels incredible and amazes all my friends. Hope to get support of more services in future.","Positive"
"195","Awesome!  Love it!","Positive"
"196","Awesome !!!! I'll trade in Siri for another Alexa any day! Love it!","Positive"
"197","Awesome!  Quite the toy/tool just wonder how long it keeps our interest....only time will tell.  I bought the Dot also - in hind sight the Dot might have been all I needed - could have saved $100.","Positive"
"198","This speaker has awesome sound and bass for listening to music!! I Love listening to my pandora on it!!! It also tells u the weather, news, and answers question u might have. Definitely worth the money!!! I Love it!!","Positive"
"199","Alexa is the best","Positive"
"200","I LOVE Alexa! I am amazed at how many different things you can do. From listening to music to setting timers while cooking, Alexa is simply AMAZING.","Positive"
"201","The most useless piece of equipment ever... it also has a terrible speaker... garbage lame and amateur","Negative"
"202","All I can say is I love It.  Very easy to setup have connected it to both WeMo devices and GE bulbs through wink hub.  Many extra features such as playing any music from my Amazon prime membership.","Positive"
"203","You know what would be great?  If the Echo was wireless.  You don't specifically mention this in the product description.  If a device can turn off my tv/lights, you'd definitely think it would be wireless too.  That seems like a huge missed opportunity Amazon.  I'm an Amazon employee too, but again, huge missed opportunity.","Positive"
"204","Purchased the Echo for my husband. It was originally supposed to be a Christmas gift but I'm terrible at keeping secrets. Plus my husband frequently checks my account, so I was worried he would see it and the surprise would be ruined.","Negative"
"205","Shipping was fast, nothing less than what we've all come to expect from Amazon. The packaging was easy to open. Set up was effortless. I love the emails that Amazon sent regarding set up and the different features that the Echo provides. It does a lot more than I ever thought it could.","Positive"
"206","Very unhappy with this item.  Most of the time it just does not work!  I ask for it to play music and it goes silent.  It rarely responds to my husband, or guest or me. But the strange thing it occasionally will respond to some question on the television. Odd!  I would not recommend for purchase as a waste of money.","Negative"
"207","I am pleased with it but I just wish I didn't have to get an app for most everything.","Positive"
"208","Easy Set Up","Positive"
"209","User Friendly","Positive"
"210","The only one I can come up with is that the Echo does not work with apple music. I'm sure Apple is a direct competitor, but that's where I keep my music.","Positive"
"211","AM a little disappointed with this , want to love but its uses are limited, I drops wifi signals sometimes and works with my automated lighting when it wants to,  the only uses to me are weather, tell me some jokes, can't see all the positive reviews, I guess  just a lot of lonely folks out there. Just not worth 179.00 just an over hyped gadget in my honest opinion!!","Positive"
"212","I have one of these (which I ordered from another site that was offering them at a lower cost at the time) and one echo dot.  I keep this one in my bedroom and mainly use it to play music, since it has a better speaker than the dot.  It is not high end Bose quality, but much better in quality than old school low end computer speakers, and some bluetooth speakers.","Positive"
"213","This is (in my opinion) very handy, and has more and more functionality being added all the time. The echo can do anything from playing music from Pandora, iHeart, Amazon music etc, to updating a grocery list, turning lights on and off, ordering a pizza, accessing Wikepedia, getting weather and traffic updates etc.","Positive"
"214","I see them as being as useful as you want them to be. Some of the skills that can be enabled are pretty useless or just for fun, but others like the alert my buddy app (which can alert a list of people if you need help, which can be great for seniors) can be very useful. I have found that it responds to and understands commands most of the time very well. It mainly only has problems when there is background noise like from a TV.  Although it occasionally understands a question but does not know the answer.  You can give it feedback through the app which you have to download to a phone or tablet to get it set up, by telling it whether the unit did what you wanted next to what it heard.","Positive"
"215","Though I'm amazed & impressed by the technology -- the speaker has a rattle in it, as though it's blown! I've tried various things -- placing it on a cushion surface (like a mouse pad), which helps some -- but a new product / speaker shouldn't have a rattle. Anyone else having similar issues?","Positive"
"216","The setup is very easy, just plugging it in, connecting it to wifi via the app and then reading off a list of 25 commands so it can configure to your voice.  It is definitely not something that everyone will find useful or see as a must have, but if you have seen the commercials or looked into it and are intrigued by at least some of the things it can do then I definitely think it (especially at the reduced holiday price) is worth the expense.  Even if you are looking for a reasonably priced bluetooth speaker this will give you that functionality and a lot more.","Positive"
"217","Love the amazon echo. everyone needs one for their house. Would recommend to friend and family","Positive"
"218","If you like to listen to music Alexa is a must have product.  I just bought it out of curiosity but I use it often for the weather and to play music.  You can tell her to play country music and she will play top country station or whatever type of music you want.  She will also play specific songs.  We have 2 parakeets that like to hear the Green Acres theme song.  Where else can you get that just by asking?  Nowhere!  It will also do many other things and Amazon is constantly adding to what the Echo can do with updates.  My Mom who is in her late 60's and will not even get a smart phone thought Alexa was Amazing!  So I may get her one for Christmas.  You must have WIFI in your house but I imagine most people these days do.","Positive"
"219","Alexa is amazing!","Positive"
"220","this is a christmas gift I need and extension on the return date to JANUARY 30th or I will have to return it.  They may not need it I have ordered 3","Positive"
"221","Easy to install, voice command music is really nice. Time to get rid of conventional stereo system","Positive"
"222","Purchased one as a family xmas gift. We have a prime account so my wife and son love being able to play tons of music easily. I like some of the simple commands when I have my hands full and want to know the time, or weather real quick in the morning.","Positive"
"223","Reordering is also a plus and pretty simple. Only have run into a few command issues where I've had to repeat myself or it couldn't understand.","Positive"
"224","Currently the Alexa app for managing it is garbage as of the last update and is pretty unusable. I had to set it up using my laptop and the web based setup. This review doesn't account for that.","Negative"
"225","worst electronic I ever bought it never understands the question or can never find the answer very very disappointed","Negative"
"226","After the first day excitement, no one at our house calls Alexa anymore. You have to buy music from Amazon for Alexa to play which I don't have many.","Positive"
"227","Alexa is becoming my new best friend!  I got this for Christmas last year, and since then there has been a lot of functionality added.  I can order from Amazon, order pizza, play music, get news briefs, and a whole lot more!  I look forward using this a lot more in the future.","Positive"
"228","I love my Echo and I received it only a month ago. I took it to my Son's house for thanksgiving and she played while everyone danced. I know my Echo will do many more things I just haven't got there yet. I bought the smaller edition for my grans and one small one for my son in Illinois.","Positive"
"229","Alexa is fantastic and is an integral part of our family now. I own three :)","Positive"
"230","Awesome!!!!","Positive"
"231","I have only had my Echo a few days but I really like it. I haven't tried everything out yet. If anything changes I will change my review.","Positive"
"232","I just wanted to play music without the hassle of changing CDs.  Just tell Alexa to play xxxxx and she shuffles the music and it plays for hours.  Easy to turn into a white noise machine with your own background sounds.  Get the weather and most questions answered.  Really easy to set up.","Positive"
"233","Ok, I didn't believe the hype of the commercials about the Echo and all it did, so I didn't rush out to buy it...my mistake.  Where do I began, the sound is so pure from this device, I was like, you hear ever note: my jaw dropped, when it first played the jazz selection, I requested.  The set up is so simple, if you mess it up, you just weren't following directions at all. I opted for the white, which looks great because i didn't want to be wiping dust everyday.  Now to get the Echo Dot","Negative"
"234","What a clear sound; and the voice recognition is very good. FUN!","Positive"
"235","Purchased this product because it seemed like the latest and greatest hype.  AND BOY IS IT EVER!!!!  It's literally fantastic.  It has increased my overall daily productivity ten fold.  Sounds fairly good, not for the audiophile, but for everything it does, the sound quality is A-OK.  Sings happy birthday in probably the most soothing voice imaginable.  Truly fantastic.  Use it every day.","Positive"
"236","Lot's of fun We enjoy using it.","Positive"
"237","Loves the Echo. However, notices that Alexa ignores me at times. Other times she cannot hear you over the music. I would say though that I am really happy with my purchase. I purchased the $3.99 unlimited music from Amazon and she has found all my music request, even the weird ones. Speaker sound is great although I would have loved more base.","Positive"
"238","Really nice product. Great sound. Very easy to setup . Wifi connection seems to be strong, even at long ranges.","Positive"
"239","What a great multi-tasker. I really enjoy the benefits of the Echo. I especially like the access to Amazon music","Positive"
"240","This is a good protect, but it still needs a lot of work.","Positive"
"241","It will understand the basic questions and items like Nest or other wireless items ti turn on or off. But when it comes to questions like what you could ask Siri, it doesn't come close.","Positive"
"242","I would expect more Amazon but they are getting there s;slowly but surely.","Negative"
"243","Love it! Young Grandkids love it! It helped our 3 year old granddaughter with pronunciation! She was determined to pronounce Alexa properly so Alexa would respond and play her favorite songs!!! It's Just purchased the third one, makes great gifts!!","Positive"
"244","I have Owned Amazon Echo for Six weeks. I am Totally impressed with ALL she can do. I do have a Amazon Prime account, which makes this a better bonus to own. Actually, If I did not have a Amazon Prime account, I still would of bought a Amazon Echo . This product is a blessing in My household. I would like to bring up that you do need to have ""WiFi with her. She has a alarm ,she has a Timer, she has a shopping list, a To- do list. Not to mention all the Apps you can add to your Alexa Amazon Account If you choose to do so. There is always something new that she can do and she will tell you. All you have to do is ask her..""Alexa, what can you do?"" She can do Math questions Tell you the weather anywhere in the US, she can give you the time,you can ask her to activate her night light, of which is on for 3 minutes, if you choose. The Endless possibilities of Amazon Alexa ! We also own the Amazon voice TV stick. OMG.. Alexa is on that as well.!!! Oh what fun we have playing the ""20 questions game with Alexa. You do have the option of calling her Echo or Amazon or her Famous name Alexa when you speak to her. Just activate that name on your Amazon Alexa account. We also enjoy a joke of the day. She is amusing! She is a great learning tool for children/Young adults. I would say this Amazon product is a great gift at any time of the year. You can also link a calendar to her (Google. Outlook etc..) she will let you know what events you have scheduled.""(Alexa, what events do I have scheduled this week?)"" And she will tell you. I also purchased a dimming smart light. It works (Links) with Alexa. So when I get home from work, I say "":Alexa, turn on the living room lamp""  and the light turns on!  What a Beautiful thing :) Since this Alexa is only 2 years old, She is still learning from her owners. The more you talk to her, the more she knows and learns. She has plenty of potential. In my Eyes, She is the neatest thing I own, that keeps me Smiling.  Thank you Amazon For this great Product!!!","Positive"
"245","Bought it to use in Canada... difficult to set up and has been lagging","Negative"
"246","Great My daughter love it!! so I got one for myself...","Positive"
"247","Love Alexa!","Positive"
"248","I LOVE my Echo!  Great speaker for music and so much fun to ask questions and get the answers right away.","Positive"
"249","She gets better every day","Positive"
"250","I purchased it on Amazon thinking it would be cool for my condo. Being a jazz lover and modern contemporary type I thought it would sit great on table in living room. The problem is the damn thing never works. I have two different wifi networks and it can never connect! When she plays music it is always cutting out! It has become very frustrating, I would have done better buying a 25 dollars Bluetooth speaker to do what this $179 piece of crap is doing.. do not buy this product you will be very unhappy with it, not worth the hype!","Positive"
"251","I read a comparison between Amazon's IP-connected, AI-assisted Echo speaker and Google's whatever copycat thing they call it. The review said that the luminescence ring on the top of Echo was off-putting to some people when the multi-directional microphones hear the wake word ""Alexa"", and the ring lights up and snaps to attention focused towards the direction of your voice. I find that delightful as it reminds me of my beloved childhood dog  Jodie snapping to attention when I uttered our ""wake word""; ""Wanna go for a walk ?""","Positive"
"252","Ordered this 11/ 24 / 2016..This item stopped working one day ""after"" the warranty expired..11/ 25 / /2016....One year to the day..How nice..Can't even get it repaired anywhere..","Negative"
"253","I use Siri heavily (to annotate text messages, to find places around me etc). I wasn't convinced if an Echo would be useful. Amazon had a sale, so I bought one to give it a try.","Positive"
"254","Almost 99% of skills I've used have been useless. I find myself using the basic things that Amazon has included within it. For music, it's great! It's a great speaker that has intelligence built in...so it's a perfect music player. I've integrated it with Spotify. It's able to read all my playlists. It works great and always manages to understand what track/artist I'm looking for. It doesn't do well with music that's not Western music...so, just beware that you can't have it look for tracks or artists that don't have western names. It may work sometimes, I guess. The speaker is actually really good. It's no Bose, but it is very good. It's not tinny, it's got some decent bass, which works well with music or talk.","Positive"
"255","As a bluetooth speaker, I use it a lot to connect it to devices that have media that I want to play on the device. It's very cool to be able to just say ""Connect to blah blah blah"" and it finds and connects to that device. This bluetooth feature works well for those who have a large library of something like music or talk shows or anything audio on a bluetooth enabled device that you want on a bigger speaker.","Positive"
"256","My wife and I have two and we love them","Positive"
"257","I also use it for news. It's surprisingly convenient to get your flash briefing as you are getting ready for work and know what's going on in the world in 5 minutes.","Positive"
"258","Some of the surprisingly useful use cases I've found are: using it to set a Timer (for cooking), using it as a clock, a weather-knower-thing and a basic dictionary, for times when you encounter that WORD that you wish you knew...you can simply yell ""ALEXAAAA!!!! WHAT'S SUPERFAGELISTI....err"".","Positive"
"259","One of the most amazing features (and yes, it is a feature) is it's VOICE. I thought Siri was a good voice until I heard Alexa. It's way more human sounding. Google Home sounds bad compared to Alexa, hands down. If Google's voice was on Par with Alexa, then I would switch to Google Home in a heartbeat...as that is a much more capable device. Alexa does some things really great, Google Home will do a lot more things great; however, saying ""ok google"" over and over again will annoy the hell out of me. I have no clue why Google can't figure out a simple thing: put some PERSONALITY behind your product so that people can latch onto it. Amazon has created the Alexa voice to be very human. I know the speech rendering technologies are probably very different...but as an end user, I don't care. Google Home will eventually have a great voice (as I saw in their latest show-and-tell. So, until Google Home's voice sounds like crap and you can't change the hotword ""ok  google"" to something, anything else! I'll stick to Alexa","Positive"
"260","Bottom line: For what Alexa does out of the box, it does it well. Skills are complete duds. If MUSIC or some type of audible media (such as books etc) is not your main use for this device, then you may want to consider twice before buying. Meaning, don't buy this to turn lights on and off...get off your butt and turn the lights on/off :/","Positive"
"261","Really enjoying the PA. And it's getting smarter.","Positive"
"262","Love love my Alexa!","Positive"
"263","Love the shopping list and ease of use of my Philip Hue lights using Alexa.. You have to train Alexa but she is also training you.  I love the neat shopping list that she produces form my voice commands to her, I then open the Alexa app in the grocery store and never forget an item.  I can tell Alexa to play anything in my prime including favorite artist and she will shuffle the hits.  I can say Alexa play upbeat R&B and she will play songs I have not thought about in a while.  Was so impressed with her my husband wanted a dot for the upstairs.  I can reorder thru amazon with no fuss and place new orders you have to work a little at this one but it does work.  Well worth the money.","Positive"
"264","Pretty amazing device which only gets better. Besides the info that's available for the asking my favorite feature is the ""smart home"" angle. I've also purchased a Dot to compliment the Echo and all has integrated well with the Wink hub. If you're into tech this device is a must have.","Positive"
"265","Alexa was looking at me in a funny way. She does not give out much in the way of personal information. I am wondering if she is plotting against me?","Negative"
"266","I think Alexa treats my wife better than she treats me.","Positive"
"267","So far I'm not too impressed with it. I was expecting it to do much more. They are adding more to the program so that's a plus. Just don't think you can ask Alexa any question and you're going to get an answer other than , hmm, I can't find the answer to the question I just heard. Needs lots of work.","Positive"
"268","Works great. Love it.","Positive"
"269","I love Alexa! Makes my life easier and more intergrated. Some people will get lazy but others (like me) will take advantage of the efficiency and integrate it into a more productive lifestyle.","Positive"
"270","Take a look at Google home.","Positive"
"271","The most ""fun"" with this product is trying to tick it off by asking really rude questions. Overall after ""adding"" mote knowledge to to Alexia it works fine. Google annoying questions to ask it and and let the fun begin!","Positive"
"272","Love Alexa.Only complaint is that she Amazon music does not always have the music I want to hear.","Negative"
"273","Awesome great sound!!!!!","Positive"
"274","Great sound, someone that really listens to me!","Positive"
"275","Favorite thing to own","Positive"
"276","Love the Echo!  Got it for a good price and decided to try it with full intention of returning if it didn't show value for us.  Although it started out slowly, we use Alexa more and more as we learn more about it.  She is really becoming part of the family over time.  :)  As other equipment is replaced in our house (garage door opener, thermostat, sprinkler controller) we are replacing them with ""alexa friendly"" devices.  It's really neat.","Positive"
"277","Bought for my wife to play music while she's cooking.  She loves it, so I love it.","Positive"
"278","Very happy with this delivery.","Positive"
"279","love it","Positive"
"280","have not been disappointed.","Negative"
"281","I love it","Positive"
"282","I am very pleased with the Echo.  It has pretty good sound for the size of the unit.  It is the perfect size for the condo.","Positive"
"283","We're in the kitchen finishing Thanksgiving dinner. My 2 year old daughter says ""recksa."" I said huh? This happens a couple times and then my wife says ""are you saying ALEXA?"" Which I followed up with ""oh, you want to hear Sesame Street?""","Positive"
"284","That was all it took. Alexa starts playing Sesame Street songs in the next room, and off goes my kid to dance and listen. It's past her bedtime, and she tricked us into getting Alexa to play songs for her.","Negative"
"285","This is absolutely the best thing I have ever bought off of Amazon. It does everthing, music, games, lights, security. Answers pretty much any question you ask. Very smart and getting smarter every day. Easy setup. Use it every day. Well worth the money","Positive"
"286","just ask and she does it, lights, music, ect. love it","Positive"
"287","Very nice product. I did however return it. The Dot is the same product for about $80 dollars less. I added a Bluetooth speaker, and BAM!!","Positive"
"288","Alexa is awesome and a new member to our family.","Positive"
"289","I love my Amazon Echo.  I used it daily.  Sadly someone actually stole it.  When I can afford it, I will replace it.","Negative"
"290","With Amazon dash buttons, mobile apps, Amazon.com and the plethora of other options combined with the absolute USELESS ability of this device of being anything smart for useful answers beyond basic conversions and arthymictic questions, it's an absolute waste of money. Even at the discounted price of $130 I feel shammed.","Negative"
"291","The good:","Positive"
"292","1. Excellent speakers - As good (if not better) than most mid-high bluetooth speakers on the market","Positive"
"293","2. Does a great job at basic things - News briefings, Weather, scores etc.","Positive"
"294","3. Seamless shopping on Amazon","Positive"
"295","1. Not very intelligent (yet). Terrible at ""unstructured"" queries. Google/Siri feel much more evolved","Negative"
"296","I am so TIRED of this horrible API.  Literally say the song's name, word for word, and it plays some off shoot version or not at all, even though the song is in my library.  Amazon has a LONG way to go in the programming department.","Negative"
"297","My best purchase ever. I have it setup with my Harmony Hub. I control my entire entertainment system with it. I also have it setup with VeraPlus. I can control my entire house. Turn on/off lights, turn off appliances and control both upstairs and downstairs thermostats. It is so awesome that I purchased a Dot2 for another room and I think I will purchase another Echo for upstairs. I use Alexa for my weather, commute, news and listen to Spotify. Alexa play Aerosmith, ""Playing Aerosmith from Spotify...... LOVE IT,","Positive"
"298","Echo is fun to have around the house! It keeps you updated with news and the weather every morning! It keeps you organized with your shopping needs and plays your favorite songs! If you are a single person alone at home this will keep you company!!!","Positive"
"299","The physical hardware is really OK.  Sure the speaker is mono but it has a decent sound for playing while I remodel my bathroom.  The voice pickup is outstanding and the signal processing for the phased array microphones works really well.  Then things go downhill.","Positive"
"300","Alexa's voice recognition (turning that signal into recognized speech) is pretty good.  It seems better than my daughter's iPhone, but not as good as my Samsung/Google phone.  I suspect this is the context part of the software that Google is just better at, but my phone also can't do that well without an internet connection so there is some backend processing at work.  The Alexa app frequently (but not always) will show you what it heard and give you some chance to provide feedback on it.","Positive"
"301","You can ask Alexa to play music in a genre which it does.  In the Classical vein this will typically be short, familiar pieces.  The musical equivalent of cotton candy.  There are a number of ""curated"" lists that Alexa can access which are usually ""relaxing"" or ""for reading""; in other words music to have on in the background and ignore.","Negative"
"302","The workaround you can find online is to build a ""playlist"" which contains the music you want.  You can go to the Amazon music app and browse and build a playlist.  That used to work pretty consistently until Amazon launched their music service and broke that functionality.  After that Alexa just plays a random piece of music that it thinks you will like.","Positive"
"303","The other unforgivable sin is that Alexa wants to shuffle.  She wants to shuffle so badly that when you put a whole album into your playlist Alexa shuffles the content on reading the list.  That's right, there is no way to turn off shuffle until after the shuffling has already occurred.  Put the album ""Toscanini complete Beethoven Symphonies"" and Alexa will start with the first movement of the 5th, then the first movement of the 9th, etc.","Negative"
"304","The good news, such as there is of it, is that all of these problems are on the back end.  The hardware piece that you buy is just an audio web browser.  The flawed content is entirely in the Amazon backend.  That means it can be fixed if Amazon wants to.  Right now there are probably 13 different ways you can query for a Beyonc song, but try to play that Bizet CD that Autoripped for you and forget it.","Positive"
"305","Echo, when playing classical music, has been reduced to the same level of functionality as a Bluetooth speaker.  If you have to manage everything from your phone by hand, what's the point of verbal access?","Positive"
"306","Once it thinks it figured out what you said is when it goes to Amazon for a search of some kind.  If its a canned search or something specific that Amazon is marketing it does pretty well.","Positive"
"307","They say Alexa is always learning.  Well you better be prepared to keep learning, too.","Positive"
"308","I don't review anything, this deserves my first review. I hate this thing! If I could, I'd give it 0 stars. I sincerely regret buying it. It has become an unreliable gonna drop you anytime, might work once in a blue-moon speaker with just as horrible an app. I could deal with it before because I could connect Bluetooth to play reliable music apps but it won 't even connect anymore. And generic emails from customer service disgrace the customer. Bring back real customer service!","Negative"
"309","Alexa is great!!!!","Positive"
"310","It sounds terrible, changes songs in the middle of the song for no apparent reason and really is nothing more than an expensive way to allow the consumer to buy more junk from Amazon.  I tried to return it but I was beyond their 30 day returns policy so they would only give me some credit to be determined and would not give me an address to the damn thing.  If I am only getting 25 bucks back I will donate it to,Goodwill and let some kid have fun with this.","Negative"
"311","LOVE IT, use it every day, get the news while making my coffee. listen to music, cant wait for it to connect with my Sonos in early 2017 update, then I can die happy.","Negative"
"312","AMAZING! I LOVE MY ECHO. I GET MANY COMPLIMENTS AND EVERYBODY WHO COMES OVER LOVES IT. MY 8 YEAR OLD USES IT AND I LOVE HOW YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE IT. I FEEL I AM TECH TRENDY, BUT HOW DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS SOONER. THANK YOU AMAZON! WELL DONE. RUN AND ORDER ONE RIGHT NOW, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!","Positive"
"313","I lesson to music most of the day, ask question, you ask it Echo does it. I woke up this morning, and just for heck of it, I said good morning, the echo said same to you, and Happy Thanksgiving. I was blown away. Worth every dime Amazon Echo!!! Dave","Positive"
"314","The family is having so much fun with Alexa and the Echo.  Certified Refurbished by Amazon is a great way to get great products, checked for quality assurance - just like new - and save a bunch of money.","Positive"
"315","Coolest tech out there!","Positive"
"316","kinda cool","Positive"
"317","Great product and excellent service","Positive"
"318","Greatest gadget ever! We love it.","Positive"
"319","Getting smarter everyday.","Positive"
"320","Love my Alexa she gives me info I want all day long!","Positive"
"321","LOVE THIS!!! It was super simple to set up and the sound quality is amazing!!!","Positive"
"322","Love it. Makes my life easier and more fun. my new housemate","Positive"
"323","I thought it would be able to look up just about anything on the internet, but I was wrong...But I do enjoy it daily!","Negative"
"324","Having so much fun with this. Listening to music, controlling my lights, getting weather etc.","Positive"
"325","Though Alexa is fun to use she's still missing some really basic skills like searching for things. She almost always cant find what I am looking for or just doesn't bother responding even though the app clearly shows she understood me. Half the time she won't play things from my Music library and tells me I don't own things I clearly do.","Positive"
"326","I enjoy my Amazon Echo. This product offers an abundance of use. I continue to learn it's capability. As a matter of fact, emails are sent to me regularly to notify me of the things this product can do. I mostly listen to music with it. You can ask Alexa to play anything you like. She can tell you the top news, weather, directions, etc.... basically anything you want to know.  I ask for the best route to work as I'm about to walk out of the door in the morning to avoid traffic.  You can even program the echo to sync with other electronics in your house. The uses are endless. My mom enjoyed it so much on her last visit to my house that she's buying one for herself.","Positive"
"327","Alexa, is great. We have enjoyed asking it question, trying to see if can stump it. We really enjoy the daily info that it shares when you tell it ""Good Morning"". Weather updates and the shopping list have been great features that we enjoy and use.","Positive"
"328","I bought my Echo on April 21, 2015 and already it has stopped working. Powerless, DOA, no power at all... I suspect it might just be the power supply but who knows?!? Either way this is not the life span I expected for this device or any device in the same product category.","Negative"
"329","Overall I like the technology, I own several Echo devices, however I find the hardware on this, my oldest Echo device. Has caused for my confidence to waiver and question whether Amazons hardware will really live up to the software.","Positive"
"330","My family loves this thing especially the kids, She helps them with homework and even cool fun facts! I love the ability to finally be able to control SMartthings with my voice this was huge! Her skills get better and more well rounded everyday! This is one device that i know i have definitely gotten  used multiple times a day every day!","Positive"
"331","Totally awesome!!!!! Still learning but having fun and it's all we expected!","Positive"
"332","Works as advertised! Really cool device. Highly recommend!","Positive"
"333","Great product. Words are not enough to express how satisfy I am.","Positive"
"334","Alexa is in my bathroom giving anyone using the bathroom great jamz...","Positive"
"335","Thank you Amazon for the payment plan.","Positive"
"336","Unfortunately it is way overrated. Even the most basic questions she cannot answer. Much worse than my Google phone. Apps? Appsolute garbage. Hope you like cat facts! or Bridge Trivia!","Negative"
"337","A: Im sorry, there is no devic","Negative"
"338","A: okay.","Positive"
"339","We don't use this quite as much as I had thought we would, but I still like having it around. The most used features for my family are: playing music through Pandora; checking the time; checking the weather; using as a timer; checking our Google calendar for events; adding shopping list items to our 'Our Groceries' app. We do have to be careful though as our 4 and 6-year-old kids have figured out how to add items to our Amazon shopping cart (fortunately, I haven't enabled the instant buy feature).","Positive"
"340","A: Im sorry, ...extremely long and annoying statement that just says she dosnt know anything.","Negative"
"341","A: Im sorry, extremely long and annoying statement.","Negative"
"342","A: Im sorry, ...extremely long and annoying statement.","Negative"
"343","M: FINE, Alexa, connect to the tablet","Positive"
"344","A: connecting to tablet (does not connect to tablet)","Positive"
"345","M: Alexa, set a timer for 10 minutes.","Positive"
"346","A: setting a timer for 10 minutes.","Positive"
"347","Weak speaker...bought the Dot instead and a Bose mini soundlink speaker that connects to my Dot so I get the best ultimate sound and all the functionality of Alexa to boot!","Positive"
"348","A: No timer is set.","Positive"
"349","A: There are 15 kinds of almonds, let me list them to you.","Positive"
"350","Like many things that are being sold as finished products these days, she is a work in progress. You spend half the time arguing with her and calling her names while you find a more traditional solution to your issues. I still use her, to turn off and on lights, I still use her for timers (although half the time I just use the microwave as you cannot tell if a timer is set or how much time is left without asking her, and some simple conversions and math shes okay with. I also use the shopping list app. Although, it MUST have a internet connection so if you are in a store with a bad connection (which is almost every store in my case), no shopping list for you!  Its near impossible to navigate Pandora stations or anything like that with her. Just know what you want before you ask her because you cant browse obviously. Like I said above, the apps fail half the time and the ones that do work are appsolutely rubbish.","Positive"
"351","Overall this is a toy. If that is what you want, you will like it. If you actually hope to use it for anything with any sort of consistency, you might be disappointed.","Positive"
"352","Amazing!  This is so much fun and so practical that I can't believe I never had it before. My family just loves it too. Can't wait to order a pizza with it. There was a bit of a learning curve but not much. Plus if you google ""echo"" lots and lots of info out there. I highly recommend this futuristic machine.","Positive"
"353","Really love the Echo.","Positive"
"354","This is the greatest device. I use it everyday and connected hue lights and a nest thermostat. Everything works perfectly. Lots of uses and well worth the price.","Positive"
"355","I love the Echo and the Alexa app which is the voice for the Echo.  I have had the Echo since August 2016.  I learn new features about it every day.  I find the Echo useful for weather updates, news,  to spell words, to read my books or to play my Audible books for me when I'm busy.  I can create reminders for taking pills or appointments.  I can tell the Echo to add items to my  shopping list which I can carry with me on my phone or print it out if I prefer.  I also can create a to-do list.","Positive"
"356","If I wake up in the middle of the night, I can ask the Echo the time, the weather or to read for a set time such 10, 15 minutes or more until I can go back to sleep or I can even ask for a joke.  If I tell the Echo to stop reading, I can pick up my Kindle the next time I want to read and will not have lost my place in the story.  The Echo will play my music playlists or I can ask for new music by favorite singers.  I can also request almost any kind of music to suit my mood with Amazon's Music Unlimited app.  There are a large number of skills on the Amazon Alexa site which can enabled to make the Echo even more useful.","Positive"
"357","Love it!!!!! So much fun and can do so much!","Positive"
"358","It is an amazing product and look forward to see what else it will be able to do in the future.","Positive"
"359","I also found the Echo amazingly easy to set up.  I purchased several EchoDots, the smaller speakers in the Echo family, that connect by wireless so I can talk to the Echo almost anywhere in my house.","Positive"
"360","As you can tell from my review, I highly recommend the Amazon Echo.","Positive"
"361","We like it ... especially for playing music.","Positive"
"362","My daughter loves her echo. She's constantly playing music, setting alarms, etc.  when it's playing music it is hard to ""wake""  Alexa so I often find her yelling over her music to ""get her attention"" Good purchase, but wish we had gotten the dot bc of the better value and ability to connect headphones or a speaker.","Positive"
"363","I know she will love it","Positive"
"364","A fun and even handy device.  Looking forward to other capabilities being added as time goes on.","Positive"
"365","Great. I love using it","Positive"
"366","Finally, something in this house that does what I ask, when I ask!  I'd write more, but right now Alexa is lulling me to sleep with my requested 'music to sleep by' selections.  If only she could dispense chocolate on demand.  My new BFF.","Positive"
"367","I am so glad I bought this! It is pretty awesome! She listens to you to! Was alittle worried because it was a refurbished! Works great so far and I've listened to her alot!","Positive"
"368","This has been great to have! Use it all the time for many different reasons! Sound is really goo too!","Positive"
"369","Does not pick up all voice commands or maybe she is just ignoring me. Have much better success with my tap.","Positive"
"370","works good","Positive"
"371","Love it","Positive"
"372","Awesome product.  I would recommend that Alexa have a little more personality.","Positive"
"373","I thought my kindle paper white was the best ""gadget"" I ever bought until I got ""Alexa"" Echo. I have been able to listen to music that most people weren't lucky enough to know...Jack Jones, Shirley Bassey, Jerry Vale, etc...etc. It's the perfect gift for parents and grandparents (me). So easy, just set to WiFi and listen. LOVE LOVE LOVE it.","Positive"
"374","The only reason i am rating it 3 stars is because my Echo did not come with a remote control, while i have a friend who purchased the same product and a remote control was included. If there is an option of buying the remote control, i will gladly appreciate purchasing one for my echo.","Positive"
"375","Be aware if you want to play prime music, they will charge you an additional fee, even if you are a prime member!  They should tell you this upfront!","Positive"
"376","Best purchase ever!  I just got  Alexa yesterday and I love it.  Set up took 5 minutes or less.  Plugged her in, downloaded the App and followed the prompts to connect her to Wi-Fi and my Amazon account.  We were talking like old friends in minutes.  I'm so impressed. The sound quality is awesome.  I enjoyed listening to my Prime music and my ITunes music (I imported my iTunes music into my Prime Library).  I can also listen to my IPod via the Bluetooth connection if I want.  Alexa walked my thru the Bluetooth set up.  Set up for Bluetooth was the easiest than any other device I have tried in the past (Bose Bluetooth set up took many tries).  I'm impressed with just listening to music at this point.  I know there are other features to fall in love with.  I can't wait to play with her some more.  I would recommend to anyone..","Positive"
"377","LOVING the Echo/Alexa.....having so much fun, along with the music. Actually like the idea to use electric and not battery.","Positive"
"378","love it","Positive"
"379","The Echo exceeded my expectations and is so easy to use. Since it is connected with my Amazon Music account I can enjoy all kinds of music which is great because I have an eclectic taste in music. That is only the beginning! I am looking forward to exploring all the other endless things it can do.","Positive"
"380","I've had it for a week now. The family really enjoying the Amazon music service. All types of genres at the command of your voice. I've installed 2 Tp-link smart switches. Easy to use and integrate with Alexa. I'm able to control my outside lighting for my home. You can also set up a schedule for the lights. Also if you're away from your home you can turn on/off the lights with your smartphone. The possibilities are endless. I'm still exploring other skills. I was fortunate to get it on sale during the one year anniversary. I really recommend this product.","Positive"
"381","I've owned this since it initially came out. The sound is great, the design is great, and it has quite a few useful features.","Positive"
"382","The search function though? Horrid. Alex doesn't understand questions, and I've noticed it's becoming worse over time. I really hope Amazon steps up its game in regard to this, because I don't want to buy a Google Home as a companion to this.","Positive"
"383","I just love Alexa... where has she been been all my life?","Positive"
"384","OK, so I've had my Echo for a few months now and it is terrific.  Love using the skills.  The speakers are awesome and can output very clear music.  Only downside is it's inability to do some simple searches.  (i.e. When is XYZ television show aired?) Hoping as it ""learns"" it's searching ability is more consistent.","Positive"
"385","Highly recommend the echo. Does everything as advertised and as additional apps are added it will be indispensable.","Positive"
"386","Wow <f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+0098> my Amazon  Echo -Black. Fun to have her name  is Alexa ,she's your best friend  n Roommate ask her anything she has the aAnswer. She s  like your assitant.","Positive"
"387","Great product.  Love using it, still finding out all about it.","Positive"
"388","Works good but doesn't have all the songs I'm looking for.I thought I spoke well but it has a hard time understanding me at times..I guess Alexa should come with a new York accent","Positive"
"389","Just got,one and Its so,worth it.  Unbelievable sound. Love it!","Positive"
"390","I enjoy having a smart voice-controlled device, but I have not found myself using the voice control for more than just asking Alexa to play a song on spotify. Occasionally, I will ask Alexa to tell me a joke, put something on my to-do list, tell me the weather, or set an alarm, but I often find my phone a more convenient utility for these features, so the utility for those features diminish.  The Echo becomes more useful once you acquire and integrate more smart home features like lights and locks, which is something I have not found the motivation to do--the value proposition is not there yet. The Echo also requires having it plugged in at all times, which can be very inconvenient when needing to move it to a new room, plugging in and waiting for it to connect to the internet again.","Positive"
"391","Fun","Positive"
"392","My unit does not work - constantly needs to be turned off and on to reset. Very frustrating - perhaps Google's device is the better way to go?","Positive"
"393","Awesome","Positive"
"394","Limited voice recognition.  Not even close to Siri or Google.  Certainly a waste of money in my opinion.","Negative"
"395","Amazing device easy set up and never ""talks back"" lol","Positive"
"396","I am new to the Echo. It's not only informative, great sound, diverse range of music, news,  stations ,Playlists. Alarms. This is a great product. I use it for ordering items to shuffling various music genre's. Very pleased. Alexa app is greatly appreciated. Will be adding on to the various smart devices that work with Echo. Family fun with Alexa as well, jokes for all ages, reading, headlines news. Enjoying Echo very much. I will update this review in a month. Owned for 5 weeks. User friendly!  No regrets thus far!","Positive"
"397","I have had it for a year now and Alexa is as good as advertised.","Positive"
"398","Enjoyable and helpful having Alexia in my home! Watch our for school kids, for she will do ALL their homework! - Dwight","Positive"
"399","Oh my goodness!  Alexa is my new best friend.  Great sound and I love all the other features, shopping list, to do list etc.  At age 76 my memory for the little things could use an overhaul.  It's great when I am cooking and see that I am running low on something to speak to Alexa and have her add to my shopping list.  Never thought I would be so fond of an electronic, but I am.  Now if I could just program her to do floors and clean the toilets I would be over the moon.","Positive"
"400","It went connect to my smart devices","Positive"
"401","My wife bought me an Amazon Echo for my birthday this past September.  I really like the device and have had great listening music through iHeartRadio, HOWEVER, with the holiday season upon us we cannot get iHeartRadio to play the iHeart Christmas station.  I can play the station through the app on my smartphone but Alexa DOES NOT recognize the station.  I've been in contact with Amazon about this and they tell me several people have reported this issue and it's unknown when and if it will be addressed and they have recommended that I utilize another 3rd party music provider.  All other iHeartRadio stations work with the exception of the Christmas station.  As a Christian, I find this to be suspect.  If this matter is resolved in a timely fashion I'd consider a higher review but I'm not going to hold my breath.","Positive"
"402","Unbelievable! What a fantastic devise. I went shopping for a very high end music system and came home with a factory refurbished Echo that I wouldn't part with for anything! It id great! AAA+","Positive"
"403","Love it","Positive"
"404","Fun to play with and great sounding speakers.","Positive"
"405","Just started to use it yesterday.  Love it!  Absolutely love it.  Wonderful clear and crisp sound with decent fabricated bass.  A must have.  Just in the one afternoon of use, of course any music I wanted was there, I asked about weather as well and jokes.  The capability is so much bigger than what I'm using right now.","Positive"
"406","I love ALEXA!!! The speakers are amazing quality and is so much more useful than Siri!","Positive"
"407","I love my echo","Positive"
"408","There are good points and bad points about this.  The value you get from this will depend on how you plan to use it.  If you have a lot of smart devices (like nest or hue lights) in your home and plan on connecting them up, then you will get a lot of good use from this.  You can also use it to order items on amazon, add items to your Google calendar, play any music you can think of, find your smart phone,  hook it up with IFTTT and other things.  There are over 900 some ""skills"" that you can download and activate, but no good way to search them to find the best ones in my opinion.  Out of the box it will play music for you, tell you jokes and order things from your Amazon account, and some other things but if you want more functionality you need to enable more skills.  Comes with a small booklet of ""things to try""","Positive"
"409","Omg. This thing is awesome.  I am glad I didn't buy a regular Bluetooth speaker.  The echo is amazing","Positive"
"410","Long time Echo owner and I still feel strongly enough about Alexa to write a positive review and it's been at least a year and a half.  She's become a fixture in my home and I use her everyday for music, timers, weather, news, and other random stuff.  She feels like a real person and has so many capabilities that each owner can use her to their liking.  I can see Amazon's commitment to upgrading the Echo and staying on the cutting edge of connectivity and artificial intelligence over the time I've owned it.  I fully recommend the Echo (Alexa) to anyone and everyone.  Amazon did a great job with this one.","Positive"
"411","The sound quality was great.  No complaints at all there.  You can also control volume manually, or speak it by saying Alexa volume down or Alexa volume 6 for instance.","Negative"
"412","We find Alexa isn't as good at understanding our voice commands as Google Search is.  It is not uncommon for us to have to repeat commands because the Echo can't understand them or didn't register anyone was speaking in the first place.  It is hard for it to recognize a voice command when there is background noise.","Negative"
"413","It's nice being able to control things with just a voice command, but many times I'm wishing for a screen to see things on, which is where the Alexa App comes in, but I find the app to be lacking, it's not as sleek and user friendly or feature rich as I want.  For instance you can't delete all history at once and it will save every command you ask it.  So if you asked it something you didn't want anyone else to know you asked, you have to go in and find the certain request and manually delete it.","Positive"
"414","The Echo is growing on me more and more as we slowly add more skills to it.  We love the bedtime stories and the ability to listen to so much music and talk radio.  My main beef is that music when played from Amazon does not have the same volume level.  Sometimes it gets louder sometimes quieter.  Have to constantly adjust volume.  Do like the voice control, but if you don't speak clearly and succinctly it doesn't always do a good job of hearing and understanding.  You also need to speak quickly, if you hesitate in a request too much it will time out before you get your request spoken.","Positive"
"415","Best gadget we had!","Positive"
"416","arrived in perfect condition and is working great. enjoying this device very much.","Positive"
"417","love it","Positive"
"418","I love love my Alexa so do my grandkids we take it from room to room","Positive"
"419","I own both the Amazon Echo and the Amazon Echo Dot (2nd Generation), so I'm writing from the perspective of someone who enjoys both, but for different reasons.","Positive"
"420","Great!","Positive"
"421","First off, the Amazon voice service is pretty amazing for most of the things I want to do. I ask Alexa about the weather, news headlines and things like that each morning to start my day. I also use it to play music easily when I'm getting ready, and also use it to set timers and stuff like that when I'm doing various activities. If you don't mind dropping nearly $200 to add a few extra minutes back in your schedule, it's pretty great for that.","Positive"
"422","This leads me to the only criticism I really have: the speaker on the Amazon Echo seems like it is lacking a good bit and not worth $179. That's why I offer up the fact that I also own the Echo Dot, which I have hooked up to my stereo system in my living room. This is where I do the majority of music listening, so having this connected to Spotify and my Bose speakers is awesome. But, when I listen to the Amazon Echo system by itself in my bedroom, you can tell there's a definite difference. (I know I'm comparing this to a Bose system, but I'm just saying - if you want good quality music, you're going to need better speakers.)","Positive"
"423","So, maybe don't believe people who think the speaker is really wonderful. It's exactly what it looks like: a tiny speaker that is just okay. If you're only interested in voice interaction and potentially hooking Alexa up to your speaker system, get the Echo Dot only.","Positive"
"424","I bought this as a gift for my husband and I can't wait to give it on Christmas morning. I opened the package just to make sure it arrived safely, and was really impressed at the quality. It's got a good weight to it, not easily knocked over when sitting out. I read through the instructions, so it wasn't time consuming on Christmas morning, and was pleasantly surprised to find out that it's very simple to operate.","Positive"
"425","Love the echo, use it for my calendar, and to listen to music primarily.","Positive"
"426","Pretty cool for playing music, looking up the weather and answering SOME questions. My husband and I love looking up random facts when we don't know something and I was hoping it would have voice recognition and look up ability similar to the google voice search, but more often than not Alexa says she doesn't understand my question, which is a bummer. Hoping to set it up to turn on lights but so far haven't been able to identify the best option for our home.","Positive"
"427","Okay so, I wanted to love this I really did. Out of the box it is a beautiful device that seemed to work very well. Now though there are so many issues. The volume wheel doesn't spin properly. Alexa answers me, but doesn't follow through with a response or a command. It's frustrating. I payed good money to have this work properly in my home, but I would say before buying explore your options because there are definitely better speakers out there and now that Google Home is out, that is worth a look!","Positive"
"428","Overall, I just think the product is a made a bit cheap and has too many flaws for something at that price point.","Negative"
"429","Was a little skeptical buying referbished but I couldn't be happier! Alexa has become an everyday essential in the house! Our little one even used it to sing him happy birthday for a quick pick me up! Lol so happy with this purchase and highly suggest to any house with a family or even just roommates. She's the life of the party!","Positive"
"430","Great product.  I was received mine in January 2015 and have seen it grow from a device with fairly limited capabilities into something that is useful on a daily basis.  The ability to check my calendar and add events was a great addition to its abilities.","Positive"
"431","Needs to come with pre-defined ""links"" to news sources, etc.  Out of the box, it should be able to answer ""Alexa, what is the stock price of X?""  but it can't -- you first have to set up a connection with a stock quote provider....  tedious for each of your news sources.  Amazon should pick a standard ""bundle"", like Basic Cable, which gives you a useful environment to work in.  Ditto for setting up and connecting my music from Amazon Prime Music to makes lists that Alexa can play.....","Positive"
"432","Fantastic !!!!","Positive"
"433","I can't say enough about Alexa.  This is the greatest gift I've ever gotten.  Extremely useful in everyday activities and controlling lights, appliances, and other technology.  I have bought 2 more for my daughters.  They work great and voice recognition has been spot on for us.  I love adding things to my shopping list as I think of them and then just looking on my phone and never forgetting items any longer.  I have prime and love just asking for whatever music I want at any given moment.  We currently use smart plugs and hues lights with it and have had zero issues with them working.  It's so easy to have Alexa do whatever and whenever you need it.  Just buy it!!!","Positive"
"434","I received the Amazon Echo as a gift one year ago.","Positive"
"435","The echo makes simple tasks even simpler! It has replaced my alarm clock completely, I can add a to-do list, I can check the weather every morning, etc.","Positive"
"436","There are a few cons that could be a big deal breaker like:","Positive"
"437","Amazon limits a lot of features for non-prime users like using spotify, ordering pizza, adding your own music","Positive"
"438","Every once in a while the echo will think I said, ""Alexa"" and it will trigger random actions.","Positive"
"439","Don't be worried though with every con there is a pro:","Negative"
"440","Love it - so much fun.","Positive"
"441","You can control your house if you have the right accessories","Positive"
"442","Overall this product is really cool to have around and makes a lot of tasks simpler.","Positive"
"443","We've been pleased with the Echo.  'So far we use it only for music, quick questions such as how to spell something, and my favorite: playing thunderstorm and rain sounds.  (We live in the Mojave Desert.)","Positive"
"444","So dreadfully disappointed.  This is a limited use item.  Amazon limits your music imports to 250 songs at the base commitment monthly fee (8 bucks) and charges for your uploads monthly after that. The news management is awkward to adjust after your initial programming. All in all I rather wish I hadn't bothered to give amazon a try on this one.  Back to Sonos.","Negative"
"445","Great great product. Good sound, and I am particular about the sound. I roll over in bed in the morning and tell Alexa to connect me to my Public Radio station. Nice playing music from Amazon Prime which costs extra. Alexa's jokes are so bad they are good. We use it to control lights in several locations in the house.","Positive"
"446","Amazing voice recognition","Positive"
"447","wont stay online..got a new router and infinity hookup  when I leave home it is on, but when I come home  it off line  , so it wont turn on the light for","Positive"
"448","My entire family enjoys Alexia! This device is in the center of our home! She keeps our grocery list, many reminders, plays all of our favorite playlists, orders amazon items, wakes us up, tells us when its time to leave, adds events to our calendars, and much much more!","Positive"
"449","I love Alexa!!! I bought Google Home first and took it back immediately. Echo is so much better. A far superior experience.","Positive"
"450","Few glitches but I like it,","Negative"
"451","The main reason I bought it was the payment options. I wanted one but wasn't sure if I needed it. Well after I set it up my family was hooked.  Honestly if you are in the market for a smart speaker you can't go wrong.","Positive"
"452","I've been an Echo user since the very beginning, pre-ordering my Echo back in January 2015.  What started out as experiment in AI has now become a very useful tool in our household.  I've since added a couple more Echo Dots around the house because I found myself wanting a reply to calling ""Alexa"" anywhere in the house I was. We started using it for music, time and weather.  Now we use it for news, directions, ordering, controlling our home thermostat, and most recently, as a personal assistant in my home office.  Way better than Cortana or Siri. Have since added Amazon Music's subscription for Echo for even more music capability.  I am probably most impressed by the commitment the Amazon team has to actively improving the platform, which is communicated to me through occasional email updates on the capabilities they have added to Echo.  The full-blown speaker version is good -- I had it in my kitchen for a long while as my primary music device.  I've since moved the full-sized Echo to the master bathroom and use it for all my updates in the morning.  I now use Echo dots connected to my computer and to my Sonos as the main kitchen and office Alexas.  Either way, you'll find a device format that works for you and once you commit to actually learning how best to use it, it really is a cool tool that you can use to make your day easier and more informative.","Positive"
"453","two years old and it quit working - no power guess  that may be the life span - cool while it lasted - not sure i would do it again","Positive"
"454","I bought this in July so I'm a little late with my review, I love this device! I bought it originally to replace my outdated stereo & since I could place this anywhere it worked great outside when we have company but it could not be to far from the house otherwise the wifi would disconnect. The only downfall so far is I had to buy another one because I mistakenly put it in the room with my bird to entertain her while I'm not home (Congo African Grey) and she is now loving it, she can turn it on, play music, skip a song & turn the volume up all without my help so if I don't disable it at night I wake up to music playing at 5am lol. So if my bird can run this device anyone can is the morale of my story. Enjoy it nothing is perfect so don't pic it apart unless you get a faulty one & they refuse to replace it.","Positive"
"455","I love it","Positive"
"456","Wow fun stuff!  Recognized my voice perfect in about 5 min!","Positive"
"457","I bought this for one purpose: to play music in a room far away from my desk computer and entertainment setup. It is a complete disaster. Not the device itself, which is brilliant, but the back end.","Positive"
"458","From what I have since read, it used to work. Therefore, Amazon can fix it. But will Amazon fix it?","Positive"
"459","It's Great fun! Ask it to tell you a joke, too cute.","Positive"
"460","If it weren't for integration through IFTTT and Stringify, I would find it limiting.  I am using this as my interactions with my smart accessories.","Positive"
"461","Not worth the money. Doesn't understand most of what you ask it. Can find some radio stations, tell me the time and temperature. Otherwise, faster to look up info.","Positive"
"462","in love with Alexa","Positive"
"463","White is rite for my decor setting it up was not easy needed a techie to get wifi that done the Amazon echo for beginners is a great help after getting the book and I don't work for Amazon the setup became much easier and quicker when you catch on Alexa is 2 x as fast as u r an amazing joke teller she keeps the great grand kids busy for hours","Positive"
"464","Love this","Positive"
"465","After the initial excitement we only use it for weather, news updates and occasional night time game or radio.  Most of the time when playing games it misunderstands my words.  It's okay.  Mostly got the Echo because of the speaker instead of the Dot.  Probably wouldn't recommend it though.","Positive"
"466","Nice product with connectivity on Spotify and other services. Also working with Philips Hue kit and a lot of other services. Recognize the voice easily.","Positive"
"467","My Alexa seems to be a little temperamental, she responds when she feels like it to who she wants.  I might need to return it, not sure if it's the product or I'm still getting the hang of it.","Positive"
"468","this is a must-have for music lovers!","Positive"
"469","I LOVE my Echo! I highly recommend you to buy one.","Positive"
"470","I love my Echo!  It is my first speaker that I have ever bought and I am in love with it.  Alexa does everything that I need her to do and MORE.  All of my friends (and even my parents) wish that they had one.  Great gift idea for pretty much anyone!","Positive"
"471","Very convenient.  I'm a big fan.","Positive"
"472","I just got this toy. I love it. There is still much I haven't used it for yet, but the concept is awesome. Alexa understands very well, and does learn as she goes. I just need to get all the items for her to interface with my house. If you just want a good speaker, she is good for that as well. I was thinking about this or Google Home. The Google item just doesn't look neat. Kind of drab actually. I love the way technology is heading, and this is a neat toy to have if you are a tech fan like me.","Positive"
"473","You can read all the advertising hype - and it's all true.  I may not use all the features - but I love the sound.  Looking forward to having Alexa read some of my books to me.","Negative"
"474","Great concept , but the capabilities are not grand.","Positive"
"475","It's amazing, I got for my daughter's birthday and she was happy to have it , she's 8 years old and she got all the answers she asked from Alexa<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083>.","Positive"
"476","No one can say anything more accurate (and damning) about the Echo/Alexa experience than what Amazon itself said. It It reads news/weather, answers random useless trivia questions (e.g. ""How far away is Pluto?"") and plays music. That's it. If you find asking it what the population of Peru is, or how many rods there are in a mile, then buy it. This is simply not compelling to me.","Negative"
"477","The Alexa skills are rather lacking and a bit bizzare, hard to use,and hard to discover. (eg ""Alexa, ask Purina what dog is good for child."") Supposedly the Alexa can control your lights, but only if you buy all new wifi enable lightbulbs.","Negative"
"478","Also, if you have small children, you will underestimate the number of times they just yell at it.","Negative"
"479","Other than that, it's a perfectly serviceable Bluetooth speaker.","Positive"
"480","We really did love our Amazon Echo, right up until it quit working 15 months after purchasing, and after the warranty ran out. Amazon support said it might be the power adapter and they gave us a credit for $20.00 to purchase another one. But, that didn't fix the problem. So, now the best they will do is give us another small credit ($30.00) to apply towards another Echo. We have decided to wait and get the Google one.","Positive"
"481","Very disappointed!","Negative"
"482","I got it for my parents anniversary and they love it.","Positive"
"483","Great product!","Positive"
"484","The best! Recommended to 17 people and they all love it!","Positive"
"485","Refurbished unit did not work properly from the beginning. Don't waste your time or money. Worked then didn't work. Called tech support. Worked then didn't work. Not worth the effort.","Positive"
"486","Very satisfied with my purchase of the refurbished Echo. Works perfectly and actually the refurbished model exceeds my expectations. Love all the features and ease of use especially when used with the Android phone app. With the phone app you can turn on or off lights anywhere you have cell service. Picked up a couple of the TP-Link Smart Wi-Fi plugs. Now I just say ""Alexa, turn on the Christmas Tree"". No more climbing around the tree looking for the plug. Also, have Echo turn on and off the living room lights. That's nice if you're in bed and hear a strange noise in the house. You can turn on the lights without even getting up. Have plans to add a Wi-Fi wall switch to turn on the bedroom ceiling fan. Ever get in bed and forget to turn on the fan - No problem with Alexa's help. Be sure to check out all the Skills for Echo now available and more to be added.","Positive"
"487","Horrible customer service. Had the unit/item since July 2016 and it had quit. Blue light keeps spinning and factory reset does not work. Unable to understand Amazon Rep...broken English. He accessed the unit to troubleshoot and unable to find solution. Unable to troubleshoot..transferred to a 4th person. Not sure why Amazon can't stand behind their product. I will be cancelling my Prime account and not purchase anything else.","Negative"
"488","What I can say that hasn't been said.  This product has changed the way that I operate my household.  I initially bought this to control my Harmony Companion remote & hub.  But then Nexia which powers my smart home hub introduced a Nexia smart home skill for Amazon Echo.  Boy did that ever change the game for me.  Now I tell Alexa to turn on the tv when I want to watch tv or I tell her to turn a movie when I want to watch a movie.  When it's time for bedtime I tell her to turn off the tv and then I tell her to turn on bedtime, which is one my Nexia scenes/automation.  When I tell her that the lights in the front of the house turn off and the master bedroom/bathroom lights come on.  If I want to turn on/off a light at any point during the time and I'm not near the light switch I let Alexa do it for me.","Positive"
"489","I will add a Echo Dot this week to the master bedroom.  That way when I open my eyes in the morning I can tell Echo to turn on the good morning scene and I'll be set to wake up.  I love this thing in conjunction my my Nexia system and my Harmony remote/hub.  If you have a smart home hub that works with Amazon Echo you should add the Echo to your system.  You will not regret it.  This device takes home automation to the next level.","Positive"
"490","I own two of these. One in my bedroom and one in the living room. This is a very solid product. The sound is great considering the size of this unit. Listening to music is great on this and if you're a prime member then you would definitely be getting your money's worth. I use my echo as part of my home automation, it works great with my lutron light system and my trane thermostats. Once you get one and use it for a while it will be hard to remember what life was like before this. The echo is always improving with constant updates and new skills added daily.","Positive"
"491","Alexa is my new BFF.  I can ask her the weather, ask her when my appointments are, ask her to play all kinds of music, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.  I can't wait to hook my house up to her so she can close the garage door when I forget, and turn the lights down...I work at home and she is absolutely indispensable.  Sometimes when I'm working, I just want some music in the background but it ruins my concentration to get up to the radio.  She also gets me up and dancing when I'm cleaning the house, and when the phone rings I can instantly silence her with my voice.  My son loves the jokes she tells, and sometimes she comes up with some really interesting answers.  She's so used to me now, I just ask her for music and she plays exactly what I like.  How does she do that?","Positive"
"492","added alot to the kitchen and easy to use.  will get for all the kids for christmas","Positive"
"493","There's a book available on Amazon called ""Amazon Echo: 2017 Edition - User Guide and Manual - Learn It Live It Love It""","Positive"
"494","A great addition to the home. Not only informative, but now works with several hubs controlling lights and home entertainment.","Positive"
"495","Why in the sam hill did I wait so long to get this?  I absolutely love it!","Negative"
"496","I love listening to music while working around the house, but don't like having to go select the next song if playing from my cell phone or on a DVD player when a song comes on that I'm not in the mood for.","Positive"
"497","With the Echo, I can tell Alexa ""next"" or I can tell Alexz to switch to a different artist/decade of music/type of music any time I want.  I can also make a request for a specific song and BAM!  It's playing!","Positive"
"498","I can't believe how user friendly the Echo is and how easy it is to get up and running.  Within 10 minutes of taking it out of the box, I was listening to my favorite hits for the 1970s.  It's also fun to ask Alexa random questions and see how she answers.  LOL!","Positive"
"499","I now know what to get all my family members for Christmas!  They'll love it!","Positive"
"500","I've had mine a little over a year & the top has come off in various pieces... I have tried to get them back on - with no luck.  It still works to some extent - but there aren't any controls on the top anymore.  Will try to see in Amazon will stand behind it and fix it or replace it - even though it was purchased over a year ago...  So I had to buy an Echo Dot to replace it.","Positive"
"501","LOVE MY ECHO!  I have her (yes, I refer to her as a person now) set up to control my Phillips Hue lights (which by the way was extremely simple to sync Alexa to them). I also use her to control my extremely hectic calendar and maintain my shopping list!","Positive"
"502","Love it! We use it in the bedroom and have the echo dot in the family room downstairs.","Positive"
"503","It easy to use and fun to have.","Positive"
"504","Thank you for an awesome product","Positive"
"505","Make sure you get it and read it.  Without that, you'll never know just how much Alexa is willing to do for you!","Positive"
"506","Love Alexa.","Positive"
"507","One of the best purchases I have made! This product is a necessary purchase for all electronic geeks!  Haven't had it long enough to get a full feeling for all of its features, but I am blown away at this point!","Positive"
"508","If i could leave a zero  or no starz . I bought into amazon on this one . The speaker id good but the AI sucks . Don't buy . There are better products out there","Positive"
"509","Do not have a smart home so we couldn't really use it.","Positive"
"510","Bought this as a gift for my son. Who happens to be a programmer. He's very happy with it. Which in and of itself is amazing. But he is actually quite gifted with tech. And is doing some pretty amazing things with this tool.","Positive"
"511","Its ok but kind of gimmicky have found some useful things it will do still trying to integrate my NEST to it and Hopefully Sonos next year","Negative"
"512","179$ for a blue tooth speaker, wifi required to function for voice commands. If voice commands functioned without wifi I may give it 5 stars. I am really just complaining because I like it so much I cannot take it with me.","Positive"
"513","This is amazing and I can't wait to see when new functionality comes out.","Negative"
"514","I really love my echo! It's super convenient. I really like telling it to play me music and order stuff for me. It's very easy to use. I can make my grocery lists just by talking to Alexa! Alexa has made my life a little bit easier. I have not had any problems with mine.","Positive"
"515","fast shipping package well would buy from again seems well made  bought 6 dots after using.  alexa is in every room with me","Positive"
"516","It works great, looks sexy in my house, the kids get a kick out of it, and when you have guests over you can really knock their socks off once you REALLY learn how to use it....  What more do you need from a non-essential gadget?","Positive"
"517","Great product I would buy again","Positive"
"518","Still learning to use it, but am satisfied.","Positive"
"519","1. Parental controls to avoid playing music with explicit lyrics... without that (as a parent) it is another issue to deal with.","Negative"

"521","Easy to set up great for information","Positive"

"528","this product is unbelievable. I asked ot to listen to radio station in london england and Alexia found it and started playing. If you have prime you have thousands of songs you can play.  sound is great. going to get one for my 2 children. they will love it.","Positive"
"529","Bought for daughter-in-law. It's everything advertised!!! She loves it. Many thanks, as she is sooooooo hard to buy for.","Negative"

"532","Free!","Positive"
"533","Loved it when it first came out.  Dealing with a lot of bait ware now, it doesn't work the same.","Positive"
"534","When providing functionality, it should be clear that what you are accustomed to can go away at any time.  Trying to find a new use for it now.  It's still a good clock, a good weather device.","Positive"
"535","This is great I'm having so much fun with it I love the way to work play music questions my answers right away","Positive"
"536","Love our Echo but after 2 years it's a $200 paperweight. It was working fine until it was unplugged and moved. When we plugged it back in... nothing. After all sorts of troubleshooting nothing. Apparently the ""unplugging Echo wrecks the Echo"" problem is more common than you realize. We will get a new one(customer service giving us a whopping $15 off for our troubles), it just bothers me it has a 2 year working life. They do replace them if the issue occurs in the first few months. If yours works, do not unplug it lest you suffer the consequences.","Positive"
"537","Very cool","Positive"
"538","nothing but a toy","Positive"
"539","Hope they come our with Drag and Drop programability and MUCH better LiFx integration.  Doesnt acknowledge rooms I have programmed with LiFX  ""Alexa,  turn the bedroom lights red""  ""Please try again with the device name and setting "" she says...","Negative"
"540","Useful for only a few things. Can't do search. I'm sure Google Home will dominate once it's out and refined.","Positive"
"541","Super cool tech!! love it","Positive"
"542","I bought this because I got a good deal through prime when it came out, at first it was overwhelming, but once you learn each part its quite helpful.","Positive"
"543","Like it.","Positive"
"544","The Echo is absolutely as cool as it seems BUT !! Its even cooler. It works with you and learns what your all about before answering questions. It works to listen to you and the way you talk. Its true this ones a keeper. 5 stars. You have to give her a little time to get used to you, the way you talk and what you talk about its always getting smarter. I love this Echo.  Paul  PS my apps do not seem to work even though I have been charged every month, could someone help me with this.","Positive"
"545","My husband bought this for us and I didn't know what it was. Six months later and I would hate to live without it lol. Turns on our apartment lights when we enter, and off when going to bed, tells me the weather and news daily, and plays the music I want when I want at the volume I want. Highly recommend.","Negative"
"546","would not work I sent it back","Positive"
"547","Sadly it stopped working shortly after the warranty was up, disappointed because I really didn't use it that much and expect it to last a lot longer. I will not purchase another,","Negative"
"548","Love it. Compliments my Prime Membership.","Positive"
"549","Use it all the time for music, weather, comedic relief with jokes, shopping list, timers and nearby restaurants. Need to get some of the smart tech plugs and lights to connect it to, that seems to be a big part of its uses.","Positive"
"550","nice product.","Positive"
"551","Pretty cool, but would like it better if you could link your contacts to text or call. The sound is decent from level 5 or lower, and even though the volume can get fairly loud, the quality suffers at the higher levels.","Positive"
"552","After purchasing this item, i found that of the two I bought, one of them has a bad speaker... is there quality checks on refurbished goods?","Negative"
"553","I like how this thing can spit out information in seconds and so alert.  I just wish it could do follow-up without having to start all over again.  Great improvements and looking forward to more updates in the future.","Positive"
"554","Great speaker, voice command response is 95% accurate from anywhere in our family room, sound quality is great.  My major uses are internet radio (via free Tune-in membership), sports scores and game schedule and time, quick news and stock market briefings, measurement conversions.  Great on all counts.","Positive"
"555","Bought just because I liked the concept and thought it would just be a fun novelty.  Wow was I wrong. Have owned for over a year and continually find more uses for Alexa.  If you don't already know what it can do, read the product page.  I don't think a single day goes by that I do not use one of the many features, experiment with the substantial list of easter eggs or just play music.  By the way,  these go to 11.","Positive"
"556","Good for Amazon Prime Music playlists, but often goes off line and biggest need for improvement - can't really answer questions like a smart phone.  Make a deal with Google and expand the capabilities!","Positive"
"557","I love Alexa. It's a great personal digital assistant. I use it throughout the day for news updates, music, podcasts and research.","Positive"
"558","Bought is a Christmas gift for my brother. Do not know how he likes it yet as Christmas is next month, but heard many great things about it.","Positive"
"559","I tell everyone about Alexa! Love, love, love her!!!","Positive"
"560","Love,love,love. Having a blast figuring out all the stuff you can do with this item.","Positive"
"561","For the refurbished model it came nicely packaged. It works just fine, except it gets the temperature of the current weather wrong even with my address in the app. There's a lot of things it still comes in handy for I guess I just have to get to know it and how to use it. For the price I paid for it was worth it","Positive"
"562","I bought a new Echo a while back and we love it so much I bought another, only a refurbished one.  The refurbished one is like new and just as perfect.","Positive"
"563","I thought I loved this device. It was just what I needed. I bought it in November, I had an issue in May with power. They sent a replacement. It didn't seem to work as well. You had to call the name several times before it would answer on most occasions. I got pass that. I get up this morning and it will not come on at all. I still have 6 days on my warranty but they can't just send me a replacement. They have to get this one back then try to fix it and possibly return the same one saying it's fixed. In the meantime my 6 days of warranty will expire once I get that supposingly fixed one back. I don't understand why they can't ship a replacement and figure out their issue with this one without me having to wait 2-4 weeks for a replacement. I paid for something to last more than a year and I shouldn't have to wait for them to investigate their problem. The tech tells me I'm not the first to complain about this same issue. Really Now","Negative"
"564","Did not come with a charger even though product description says it comes with a charger.  On the phone for a long time with Amazon being switched to 3 different people until they finally give me a voucher for the charger so I have to place another order.  Product description needs to be accurate. Why pay for Amazon prime if they are going to act like a third rate internet store.","Positive"
"565","This is  amazing sometimes alexa seems like a real person truly an amazing product.","Positive"
"566","Received my Echo yesterday. So far, I love it! Just in time to play all my Christmas music! Time to get rid of all the CD's !","Positive"
"567","The greatest thing I've ever bought.  Does so much more than I thought it would.","Positive"
"568","The best!","Positive"
"569","Got this for my wife and she loves it","Positive"
"570","Echo won't let me order saying ""Sorry, I can only order products for Prime Members.""","Negative"
"571","AAA","Positive"
"572","This is a birthday gift for my husband- he saw one and thought it was would be fun.","Positive"
"573","We love Alexa","Positive"
"574","Awesome!!! Love it .. great buy to start your home automation!!!","Positive"
"575","LOVEEEEEE..set up entire house to turn on and off different things, including lights, ceiling fans, etc. Wife is VERYY spoiled now!! lol We have the echo and also 2 dots and may order more dots for the other rooms. VERY MUCH WORTH THE BUY!!","Positive"
"576","Great product fun, entertaining and educational","Positive"
"577","All I can say is ""why did I wait so long to get this"".  I have been looking for over a year and all it took was a word from  our physician.  He was saying all the things it could do and was so excited about it, we had to order it.  Setup as easy.  I still need to learn all the app and how to use but I love  the music it plays, gives us the weather, tells us corny jokes, and so many other things.  I LOVE this toy/learning means and intend to use it daily.","Positive"
"578","I bought this refurbished. After the initial set up, I was having problems with the echo playing anything (music, radio stations, etc) that wasn't in Alexa's voice. I got a little frustrated, because you know, refurb, but after unplugging and waiting a few seconds to plug it back in, it works like a charm.","Positive"
"579","Wow!  I'm a tech junkie and I was blown away by this gadget!  Set-up was a breeze with the iPhone app.  The music ability alone is enough for me to own the echo, but the ability to control my Nest thermostats is a nice bonus.  I've already ordered 2 dots for the kitchen and bedroom to pair with my existing bluetooth speakers.  Nice job Amazon!","Positive"
"580","I really enjoy this product. I do sometimes get upset about it not understanding my questions but then again it works good for a large room. Comes in handy for cooking. Just tell it to set a timer and it keeps you working what time it does it for you. Also good for music for the kitchen cleanup after you finish cooking with the prime music. Its a most have for a modern kitchen.","Positive"
"581","Fun to have around.","Positive"
"582","Awesome","Positive"
"583","Very cool device. Ask it to play a song or set a timer and it just works.","Positive"
"584","The shopping list and to-do list functions are great, but the search functions leave a lot to be desired. Basic search requests, like ""when was ""insert famous person's name"" born?"" are likely to return a ""hmm, I don't know how to answer that question"". Rephrasing the question generally does not help. Others, such as asking how to say something in another language, return ""I don't know how to say that, but.."" and then it gives you the written phrase on your phone, which defeats the purpose of having the voice interface. Also, if Alexa doesn't quite understand the question, and gets a lot of possible answers, you have to look at your phone to see the list of possibilities, again defeating the purpose of the voice interface. Finally, I would like to be able to use a search engine besides Bing. You cannot even tell the device to Search Google. Now I see Google has come out with their own device, and I am little sorry I didn't wait. The Google device is cheaper too.","Positive"
"585","I bought this product in October 2015.  Worked fine until about 2 months ago, when it suddenly stopped working.  Won't even turn on.","Positive"
"586","As for the one bad reveiw about Alexa being deaf...well if you to the voice recording to set up your voice, it works perfect, my wife had a probblem with one of the dots, now works great, that Alexa recognizes her voice.","Positive"
"587","I took a chance on this product based on two things, the wonderful reviews and it was on sale. I wasn't expecting much but I have to say I was very happy with what it does. It is very helpful around the house. I love being able to ask for almost any song ( with amazon prime) anytime one pops in my head. I love the shopping list feature. I love the calendar feature. I love the weather, traffic, timer features. Every week we find something new this little sucker does. If you don't have one yet you should get one.","Positive"
"588","Best buy ever!","Positive"
"589","OMG, I am so in love with the Echo! I am still learning everything that I can do but I think I am getting the hang of it. Setting up Alexa is super easy and connecting her to smarthome devices is just the same.","Positive"
"590","I've heard reviews that said the speaker on the echo isn't great. Um, what? I think it's amazing...then again my previous speaker was a cheap $10 Bluetooth speaker that sounded horrible. The sound quality is amazing.","Positive"
"591","I'm in LOVE with Alexa ;-)","Positive"
"592","The Amazon Echo has quickly become a valuable personal assistant.  While there is much room for improvement, the engineers are working on making the Echo better every day.","Positive"
"593","Echo is GREAT for adding items to my shopping or to-do lists!  Sometimes the app is laggy or won't open at all when I'm in the grocery store and really need my shopping list.  Instead I've been taking a screenshot of the shopping list so I can pull it up quickly.  I""m still amazed they haven't created a widget for using the shopping/to-do lists to make them easier to access.  ..... but I believe things like this are in the works.","Positive"
"594","Echo is also GREAT for listening to music or podcasts, and I find the control to be intuitive and easy.  It misses the boat with the web search functionality, however.  When you ask a question that it doesn't know the answer to directly, you'll get an answer like ""I'm sorry, I don't know the answer to the question I heard. I have sent Bing search results to the Alexa app."" Well.... when I'm asking a question by voice, it's because I need a hands-free response.  I have sent this info to the support staff and they tell me the have added it as a feature request.  I'd really rather it say ""According to Bing.... blah blah blah"" and then maybe ask if you want more information and it will keep reading.","Positive"
"595","Overall, I LOVE THE ECHO and find it to be fun, practical, and entertaining.  Definitely a worth-while purchase!  Makes me want to buy a couple more for the farther ends of the house. :)","Positive"
"596","We like this new addition to our family. Everyone uses it and it is getting better all the time as they add more apps that it works with.","Positive"
"597","Really good, but I have problems with the microphone... but amazon take the case really well as always... the Echo is FANTASTIC... AMAZING SOUND! Better than ""Bose""...","Positive"
"598","Love love love my Echo. I tell it to do everything!! Very cool product. I have a DOT too and it is cool.","Positive"
"599","Just got the Echo a week ago and already am in LOVE with it!  Just her ability to play music for me by Artist, genre, song, etc is amazing!  She comes up with GREAT playlists! But that only scratches the surface of what she can do!  I can ask her the weather when I'm getting dressed - or who is singing the current song.  It does take a little more effort to get her to find you recipes, etc but you can 'train' her and yourself to use the right commands and learn how to ask for what you want..I can see this really exploding on the market very soon...and it's A LOT of fun to show her off when people come over..Not to mention this was an excellent deal - the Refurbished one comes with the same warranty as the brand new one - only $60 cheaper!..I haven't purchased the outlets yet to control my home but Xmas IS coming:)....","Positive"
"600","""Alexa"" is a great addition to our family and home. We love using her for many things in our home like weather, trivia, Amazon Alexa Deals, sports scores,  music (sound quality is great too) and much more! Looking forward to getting some ""Smart"" technology in my home next to work with Alexa. I'm a happy Prime member!","Positive"
"601","AWESOME!!!!! if you dont have one get one","Positive"
"602","Fantastic product.  Great tool for our shopping list.  Hope they keep adding additional apps for this product.","Positive"
"603","I'm rather disappointed concerning the Amazon Echo and was very much looking forward to using this in the home.  But after getting it and using it for several days the mic's would not pic up all my voice commands even when I was standing next to it.  I also have 3 Dots and they instantly pic up my voice commands and requests, but don't have the speaker output that the Echo has.  I'm with the return window and that's what I'm doing.  Maybe the technology will improve more over time.","Positive"
"604","awesome product. Bought for a physician office procedure room and the patients really appreciate it. We appreciate that hands free voice technology!","Positive"
"605","When I purchased the refurbished Echo, it was not stated anywhere that the power adapter was not included. In fact, under the ""what's in the box"" section it says that it includes the power cable. Alas, when I opened the box it says to ""plug in the power adapter (not included)' as part of the instruction. Needless to say, I am disappointed and will be sending this back immediately.","Negative"
"606","Pros: Great audio quality, fun integrations, Alexa is useful!","Positive"
"607","Cons: Integration experience is a bit janky","Negative"
"608","Works fine.","Positive"
"609","Works very well except if you have poor wifi it cuts out. Need good wifi!","Positive"
"610","This is truly one of the best purchases I've ever made.  I started building up a smart home because of the novelty and excitement, but as that started to wear off, I was feeling a bit fatigued by the entire action of opening up a phone app, flipping to the right device, and turning on a control.  Often, this would have be simpler to do manually.  Alexa gave me full control over my smart home from the living room without touching my phone.","Positive"
"611","The speaker quality is legit.  We admittedly have a smaller living room, but it is perfect for background music while doing chores or entertaining company.","Positive"
"612","My only gripe is with the integration experience.  There are a ton to choose from, but they vary greatly in quality of set up.  I've had some that were really easy to set up, some where the translation from the native app just wasn't there.  I expect this is more on the 3rd parties than on Amazon.  Anyway, over 1 year of use in the bank, and fully expect to keep using Echo for the foreseeable future!","Positive"
"613","I love the Echo. Great for music once it's set up and useful for news and weather when you're making breakfast. I also have it linked to my thermostat which is neat but not a game changer.","Positive"
"614","The down side is that you have to wait for it to learn and build up your playlists. The web searching is also terrible. Compared to Google Alexa seems pretty dumb.","Negative"
"615","It works very well even with a heavy accent and hears me from other rooms. The only thing Alexa can't contend with is a screaming baby!","Positive"
"616","Most wonderful, ALexa finds whatever music I want responds to my every desire.","Positive"
"617","Liked it so much we have purchased 3","Positive"
"618","Haven't hooked mine own up, but used at a friends.  So fun and informative.  Also keeps you company when you live alone.","Positive"
"619","Unless you have an iPhone, I don't suggest buying an Echo. The Echo works fine, but you need the Alexa app in order to set it up which only seems to work on older phones (that aren't made by Samsung) or an iPhone (which still runs painfully slow if at all). If you were thinking that it would work on the Kindle Fire since it is an Amazon product, it doesn't. So until they fix the app, your Echo is an expensive paperweight.","Positive"
"620","Get Google Assistant instead... this is a fantastic speaker, but Alexa is quite annoying; it doesn't understand half the things you expect it to, and doesn't offer much more than alarm, timer, music player, and news; which is lame for the price.","Negative"
"621","so far am loving it.  did a knock knock joke and it gave a Dr Who reference. Starting to add automation stuff to it hope it goes well","Positive"
"622","Awesome!","Positive"
"623","It's easy to use and a nice voice assistant. It's easy to connect with hue hub and light bulb, works great. And the prime music is pretty awesome, i love it. But the price dropped $40 after i bought it, sad...","Positive"
"624","I love this thing.  I use it for home automation by integrating it with Home Control Assistant software and my Honeywell Total Comfort thermostats.  I can walk in a room and say ""Alexa, Turn on the bedroom lamp"" and I feel like I'm in a Star Trek scene when the light comes on.  I can also say things like, ""Alexa, Set thermostat to 74.""  My only complaint is that I cannot change the key word from ""Alexa"" to ""Computer"".","Positive"
"625","I use Alexa for almost everything. Truly impressed with the Amazon Echo. I will be purchasing several dots soon to have my whole house active.","Positive"
"626","I highly recommend this product.","Positive"
"627","Great product","Positive"
"628","Update: the app has been fixed so it is now working for my LG. It is still running slow but I'll take it. My old phone (Motorola X), which was being used as an ""Alexa remote"", can now finally be retired.","Negative"
"629","Will re-purchase at a later date","Positive"
"630","Husband loves loves loves this.  Being an older generation this is perfect for voice command....hated trying to figure out the cd machine.  We ask it all kinds of questions.  For anyone living alone it is a perfect solution to communicate and get answers.","Positive"
"631","Read the reviews, they're right, this thing is AWESOME!  We use ours primarily in our kitchen.  Timers, reminders, measures and music while we entertain and cook is perfect.","Positive"
"632","I feel like a member of the Enterprise space ship. ""Computer, How does the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principal apply to dark matter?""  OK It can't answer all my questions but it's a start.","Positive"
"633","Echo has a hard time understanding the command/question. I don't even brother to ask it questions anymore because the search engine is Bing and you can't change it to Google. Google Home is much better but doesn't have that many app that can work with it compare to the Echo.","Positive"
"634","<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D> love it!!!","Positive"
"635","Purchased for a gift.  The family says it is the talk of the neighborhood.  They love it.","Positive"
"636","Initially I only used it to listen to music or to entertain friends by asking it silly questions. Now I use it mostly to listen to Audible books while painting (I'm a professional artist) or to get daily weather reports. However, I wish we could change to name to something of our own choosing. My daughter's name is Alexis and whenever I said her name the Echo would turn on! I finally was able to change the wake word to ""Echo"" but my question is-why call it an Echo then name it Alexa? Really dumb move. Other than that, I really love it. I am continually finding new ways to use it.","Positive"
"637","I am still finding out everything this can do but omg I really love it. I am now looking into Dot for my bedroom","Positive"
"638","We use our Echo every day. We ask it about the weather, play spotify through it and I use the Bluetooth option to run the sound from my phone when I am watching movies on my phone. Fun and functional!","Positive"
"639","Love it","Positive"
"640","I am IN LOVE with the echo! This is a great product with so many capabilities! I bought it for my husband and am using it more then he is. The sound is clear and she picks up your voice from across the room and over a room full of people. The set up was quick and easy and there at tons of ""skills"" that you can download to customize your echo. I HIGHLY reccomend this product!","Positive"
"641","Great product","Positive"
"642","Gift for friend and she likes it.","Positive"
"643","So far works great; my new BFF","Positive"
"644","Fun for family to use but after about a week we find out generally useless. Best part is playing music... If it can find a song. But the need to find 3rd party skills for simple stuff like looking up a stock price is needlessly complicated. Maybe she will grow on us.","Positive"
"645","Fascinating technology and superb sound!","Positive"
"646","I love this! I have had it for a while and they keep coming out with so many things to do on it.","Positive"
"647","So today is my birthday. My husband bought me the echo as a gift. We live in the Caribbean. I have been a Prime member for years now, paying $100.00 every year and shopping constantly on Amazon. If you're buying the Echo to listen to music because you think that your paying the Prime Fees gives you access to it - BE WARNED. You are wasting your money! Prime does not provide music to Prime members outside the US making the Amazon ECHO a useless piece of plastic for users like us. It does not pair with iTunes... unless you route it through some other device (which is pointless if I already have another device to play my iTunes. Location infor and weather deets don't work outside the U.S. either (but let's be honest - no one pays $179.00 to be told the weather and time). In truth, it feels like a bit of a scam that this device is being sold to non-US Amazon Shoppers when it OBVIOUSLY cannot fulfil most of it's purpose outside the US. I am so angry about it that I think I will be cancelling my Prime Account too. I guess Happy Birthday to me. And my husband feels so disappointed that this thing ruined his birthday gift.","Positive"
"648","Was a gift and recipient loves it.","Positive"
"649","Alexa, what's on my calendar today.  What can I say; I love it. My kids got it for me last Christmas and I literally had no idea what the 'Echo' was. Well, I found out real quick and believe me it goes all over the house with me.  Kitchen, lower level where I sew, bedroom, Can't wait to add an Echo Dot to it so I don't have to carry it around.  I listen to music, books, news.  Folks, it's the best. Great sound as well and great to give as a gift.","Positive"
"650","easy set up. now only if I can get her to get me a beer","Positive"
"651","I don't think you can get any better than this. Just added WeMo switch and it was so easy. We have 3 ecobee thermostats we can remotely control. Sound quality is more than a little lacking, but just ok.","Positive"
"652","I like so much!  <3","Positive"
"653","Nice toy, was easy to pair Bluetooth.  Sadly it is not very intuitive.  Simple questions, easily answered by asking Google render Alexa  perplexed.  Adding liked songs to Amazon Music requires you to open the Alexa App. What's the point of a voice recognition device that requires you to use another device to do so?  Google can do it, so please don't go the way of the Nook..","Positive"
"654","Love the Echo, really sets the mood for any atmosphere. I love the white color. Alexa understands me a lot better than Siri. The only downside is that it's not well intregrated with my Apple products such as accessing my calendar or reminders.","Positive"
"655","Lots of fun! And useful too.","Positive"
"656","We love our Echo but please, Amazon, make more names available, as our African Grey is a quick learner.","Positive"
"657","Love my Echo!! I use this more often than my expensive sound system and think it sounds just as good. We have one out by the pool, and when we have visitors, they love to ask Alexa ridiculous questions to see what she will answer.","Positive"
"658","I freaking love Alexa. The sound is awesome and maybe she can't answer EVERYTHING but she learns and you can add skills to the app that helps. She will become your new best friend.","Positive"
"659","Excellent...purchased the echo for my husband.  He loves it. Says it's the best gift he has ever received.","Positive"
"660","Loving Alexa so far.  I'll have to get one of the books out there to give me ideas one the finer points of programming her.  The shopping list alone is worth it.  I always leave my list at home and the app makes writing it down a thing if the past!","Positive"
"661","It's easy, you try it and ask yourself how you've survived all this time. A little dumb at first, as you keep using it it learns. Very cool product.","Positive"
"662","I am finding it is an expensive radio, and alarm clock.  I connected it to my Pandora account, but it doesn't often work.  I ask "" Alexa find me a station with 70's music "" - she says "" there are no stations that have 70's music "".  I ask "" Alexa, I would like to hear some showtunes "" She says 'I am unable to find showtunes music "" Irate, I raise my voice and ask for "" Broadway showtunes ""....she replies, "" Oh, you would like to hear showtunes radio ""  UGH...Not as sophisticated as it should be.","Negative"
"663","Love Alexa. Told her so. She said, Thanks, it's nice to be appreciated.  Very helpful. Love that she listens to my 4 yr old grandson's ""orders"" also, i.e. play pop pop's song.....","Positive"
"664","This is one of the most incredible items I have ever purchased on Amazon. There is plenty of room for improvement with the Amazon Echo, but overall exceeded my expectations. This Amazon Echo is like a little helper. When you need some music she is there. What happened in sports last night, she's there. What is the weather like, Alexa has your back. The Amazon Echo is just incredible. Not perfect and plenty of room for improvement, but definitely worth buying.","Positive"
"665","Gotta tell ya I LOVE THIS !! Sound is AMAZING!!!  Had my doubts..... JUST BUY it!!!","Positive"
"666","Love my new Echo home!","Positive"
"667","Alexa has started to really automate my life at home. Talking to my Nest and Hue bulbs. Sound quality is decent and fills a room nicely.","Positive"
"668","I think the app for the iPhone seems laggy and not as seamless as it should be. When playing music it often doesn't update with whats actually playing. Also want the music to be easier to scroll through and select. I imagine Amazon will do a lot in the future to help improve this side of the product.","Positive"
"669","The actual product is a lot smaller in person. Which is a good thing if you plan on traveling with it. It does a lot of nifty things and it's pretty cool how far off you can be when speaking to the echo. It's quick, responsive and thus far realiabe. I would say if you're interested in purchasing something that can do it all, this is your best bet.","Positive"
"670","This is the best product that I have ever bought..Thank you so much","Positive"
"671","excellent","Positive"
"672","After few days, the hype sort of fades away. It seemed like this product is more in to doing marketing for amazon then doing anything else. I am a hotel owner and there are bunch of reminders I have to use everyday to keep me at the top. My whole goal before purchasing was that I can say ""Alexa remind me to check bulb in room 227 in 30 minutes"". To my surprise Alexa will not create a remind just by listing to that sentence. It will ask ""What time""?. Well, what does ""in 30 minutes"" supposed to mean?","Positive"
"673","AI systems in mobile devices are easily able to do this just by listening to that one sentence. Then why not Alexa? Especially when I am paying premium price just for features like those?","Positive"
"674","Now Echo is sitting on my kitchen counter. In last 5 days, I have said only one thing to her ""Echo you're stupid"", she said ""I am sorry to hear that, I try""","Negative"
"675","The sound quality of Echo is amazing.","Positive"
"676","I REALLY LIKE ALEXA","Positive"
"677","This is an amazing product. I like it very much. My little daughter also learns to speak to Alexa and she enjoyed this great technology!","Positive"
"678","I LOVE IT!!!!! Music, music, music! I love Alexa. She answers my questions, plays songs, albums, shuffles an artist or type of music. Fantastic.","Positive"
"679","Weather, traffic, wikipedia. Get one. Enjoy. Explore. Top notch hands free entertainment.","Positive"
"680","I purchased this when it was first offered by Amazon, It has sat in the same place in the kitchen on the counter, has never been moved, never been knocked over ( don't have pets or kids).  in late 2016 I noticed the top of the device was kinda sticking up, and when I inspected it, I found that the top ring that has the buttons on it, was loose.  I found that the top was held in place by screws up from the inside and they had broken free.  When I inquired as to why this happened and if I could get it fixed I was told that no I would have to buy a new one.  The unit works fine just the top ring is broken.  So thus the less than stellar review.","Positive"
"681","Super fun. This thing seems to do all sorts of stuff. Ask Alexa if she has a boyfriend, what color is the sky, sing me a song, weather, traffic, colander, find my phone, and more. The kids love it and we love it.","Positive"
"682","I'm physically handicapped and Alexa makes my life easier. Other voice recognition devices (Siri, Dragon, ect.) can't understand me but Alexa has no issues. Amazon should market this to the disabled community.","Negative"
"683","Great entertainment options. I like it because I can listen to any type of music at any time while still listening to local radio when I want to.","Positive"
"684","THE SOUND IS GOOD. iT HAS TROUBLE WITH VOICE COMMANDS.","Negative"
"685","Great Product!!!","Positive"
"686","After about a 1/2 year of use, I find that I don't really use it much.","Positive"
"687","Liked","Positive"
"688","Good for playing Amazon music.","Positive"
"689","""Hears"" your voice from quite a ways","Positive"
"690","I'm still trying to figure out what to use it for.  It is amazing with streaming music.  But its great.","Positive"
"691","Good for weather","Positive"
"692","Novelty","Positive"
"693","""Skills"" are largely useless, unless you like cheesy trivia games or seven versions of ""rock-paper-scissors""","Negative"
"694","""Echo"" iPhone app is largely useless, except for initial setup","Negative"
"695","I've got music in the Apple ecosystem and Amazon ecosystem --- but it's a royal pain to get Apple music to Amazon...","Negative"
"696","""Traffic"" feature only works on a pre-defined route","Positive"
"697","I love my echo! It sounds great and I can ask for the weather and it told me right away. I stream music out of it a lot and the sound is Fantastic","Positive"
"698","You can't ask Echo to ""google search"" something -- read the top 3 results, then read the webpages that come up.  This would be a killer feature.","Positive"
"699","Otherwise, it's a novelty.  And if I wanted to invest $$$ on home automation with voice recognition, maybe Echo is more useful.  It's well-built and has high quality, but just doesn't have capabilities that I would want to use daily.","Positive"
"700","Ok after downloading the Alexa App and setting up the Echo.....I don't know how I lived without Alexa!!  I mainly use it for Music and News.  works great and gets better all the time.  Save $$ and just get the Echo Dot if music/Sound is not important for you.  Basically the Echo is an Echo dot on top of a Speaker.  A good speaker at that.","Positive"
"701","Sitting here listening to her now and great music.","Positive"
"702","Never had anything like it.","Positive"
"703","Perfect addition to a home.","Positive"
"704","Thank my Amazon friend for his recommendation.","Positive"
"705","Been a lot of fun to use Delivered on time.","Positive"
"706","Love her ! Now we always text our friends glad to hear a sweet voice","Positive"
"707","item received no problems","Negative"
"708","Amazing","Positive"
"709","So much fun to play around with. The music library is astonishing. Much more than a toy as more features are utilized.","Positive"
"710","Great product.  My family uses it to play music, ask about weather, my kids ask Alexa to tell jokes.  My tech savvy family will be using it further to work with Mindstorm Lego Kit sometime in the near future for a tech project.","Positive"
"711","Move to a new city, and have no friends? Don't worry, Alexa is all you need!","Negative"
"712","Great","Positive"
"713","love it","Positive"
"714","great","Positive"
"715","I love this item, it's amazing!!","Positive"
"716","lots of fun","Positive"
"717","Still new to me. But falling in love with ""Alexa"" does more than I expected.","Negative"
"718","Shipment was very quick and echo is everything I thought it would be. Very satisfied","Negative"
"719","DO NOT BUY THIS ECHO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! IT HAS VERY SHORT LIFE. IT JUST STOPPED WORKING AFTER 6 MOS! AMAZON WON'T EVEN REPLACE IT! I HAVE BEEN TOSSED BACK AND FORTH BY CUSTOMER SERVICE ABOUT ORDERING A POWER ADAPTOR TO SUPPOSEDLY FIX IT BUT TOOK FOREVER TO ARRIVE. THE ADAPTOR LOOKS FAKE TOO AS SHOWN IN THIS PHOTO! IT STILL DOESN'T WORK! IT WON'T TURN OUT! I TRIED ALL TROUBLE SHOOTING TIPS BUT FAILED! JUST A PIECE OF JUNK! A DISPOSABLE RADIO ONLY!!! I BET THE ECHO DOT IS ALSO LIKE THAT! GRRR! I'M SO DISAPPOINTED!  I USED TO LOVE THIS ECHO BUT NOW I REALLY HATE THAT IT BROKE SO EASILY! IF I COULD GIVE NEGATIVE STARS I WOULD! VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE TOO!","Negative"
"720","Alexa is awesome.... She understand most everything I have ask... Except I haven't figure how to get the correct temperature for my location she has it celesuis ... Other then that I have been able to to link her with my blue link app for my car...","Positive"
"721","1 at work, one in the bedroom, and this one in the kitchen now!!!!!! I love Alexa!","Positive"
"722","Now I can sleep with rain sounds, this echo idea is amazing, I hope it keeps evolving","Positive"
"723","Good sound quality.","Positive"
"724","I had a friend show me his Echo, and I decided to purchase one. I bought a Certified Refurbished one, and have had to reset it a couple of times.  I hope this is not a recurring problem.  When it works, it's pretty cool. I like the broad music selection. The speakers sound pretty good, for such a small enclosure. I'm sure I've barely scraped the tip of the iceberg, as far as the Echo's capabilities, and I look forward to continuing to use it more and more.","Positive"
"725","I totally love it, as does my husband.  I get any music I want just by saying ""alexa, play Sinatra"" or I can name a particular song.  It is a timer, a purchasing tool, and it answers questions to settle little disagreements.  ha!  You can get sports scores, everything.  For a small device, everyone who sees it says the speaker is superb - and it is.  I'm buying more for gifts.  It is just wonderful.  It is easy to set up also.  You do need Wi-Fi in your home, but that is all - it walks you through the set up.  Go get one!!!","Positive"
"726","OMG I love Alexa. I wish she could be with me everywhere. If you don't have one, purchase it now!!! The monthly payment idea was great too. Would buy again.","Positive"
"727","This thing is awesome. Wanted a speaker that wasn't halfway across the house to listen to while I cook. All the smart features are a bonus because I'm a Prime member and therefore have access to tons of music but also have the Hue. The sound quality is great. Using it for items you order all the time is so easy and you don't have to worry about the price. I've double checked several times.  Finding or making playlists on Prime and then asking Echo to play it still delights me after having it for months. Hue is pretty easily controlled through it, tho I wish you could request scenes. I ask it about the weather, news, sports, trivia, you name it! The name ""Alexa"" wasn't cutting it for me, so I started calling it ""echo"". Wish you could do custom names with a learning mode or something but that's another great thing about the Echo, it's always getting better! Haven't tried much else currently but REALLY, REALLY hope Amazon (PLEASE) adds control for the Fire TV. I fantasize about it all the time. MAKE IT REALITY PLEASE!","Positive"
"728","Needs work","Positive"
"729","Love the echo","Positive"
"730","love it. i am a 76 yr old male. never in my lifetime would see this. when ALEXA goes into one of her long winded talks and i say stop she stops. i really do love this devise.","Positive"
"731","Love Love Love my Echo!  Use her all the time.  Music is always playing in our home again and being able to add things to my grocery list verbally and instantly is a real plus for me!","Positive"
"732","Basically, Alexa is Siri's.'slow' little sister.  She rides the short bus to school, wears a helmet with a propeller, and no one expects much of her in the way of worldly accomplishments.","Positive"
"733","We love Alexa more and more with each passing day!","Positive"
"734","Please, someone, come up with something with similar features to Alexa but that actually functions better than a middle-aged switchboard operator!  I cannot wait to get drunk and throw Alexa.that blankety blank blank bank..out of my 4th story window and watch her shatter to pieces on the sidewalk below (obviously not harming passersby - unless they are susceptible to 1937-style technology).","Negative"
"735"," Alexa cannot hold any kind of a conversation.  It's like her coders were complete technological drones void of imagination. She can't understand you  half the time and, when she can, she has no idea how to respond. Seriously, Amazon?  Whoever is responsible for that area of Alexa's development should have to live with a thousand Alexas in a very dark, sound proof 4x4 room.forever.","Positive"
"736","I ordered an Echo not knowing my boyfriend had sent me one as a surprise.  I returned the one I ordered.  Wish I had actually returned both.  There's really not much else on the market right now that can compete with the outdated voice recognition technology this device has.  It's decent only because there's nothing else out there. Congrats, Amazon!  You're only not super terrible because there's no one else terribler than you at the moment.","Positive"
"737","Every cell in my body lives only for the hope that someone somewhere is working on something better.","Positive"
"738","I just love my Amazon Echo! The sound quality is awesome and ""she"" is sooo smart. The only issue is at times if the volume is up it will not always respond to my commands. This device is very nice and I'm really enjoying it so far :-)","Positive"
"739","My wife purchased our first Echo; one month later we purchased 2 more.  Voice recognition is very good; better than that of smart phones I've expericed.","Positive"
"740","My greatest surprise was the sound quality.  I am not familiar with the current state of high fidlity audio, but I considered myself an audiofle in the 80's and 90's and experienced some of the highest quality music reproduction available at that time.  Irrespective of its size, this device produces some of the best sound quality I have experienced in 20 years.","Positive"
"741","I am stiil a neophite regarding the Echos' capbilities, particularly what database it uses for specific music selections.  In some cases the Echo does not have access to the entire, track, album, or artist library, but will play ""samples"".  When it does access a complete song, it often selects a rendition that I am unfamiliar with; song by other than the original artist, or a live version.  I find this characteristic refreshing as I enjoy discovering ""new, old stock"".","Positive"
"742","I recenly discovered you can upload your digital music library to your Amazon account and your Echo will access that library, however the free limit is 250 tracks.  You can pay $25 a year for and upload up to 250,000 tracks!  That seems like a deal to me, but it also highlights the ultimate purpose of these devices; to sell the user content and services.  The device also streams on-line radio via TuneIn, but other .free and subscription-based streaming services are supported.  Additionally, if you query some information. say, the best vitamin for improved memory, the device will often direct you to a ""product"" on the Amazon sight, AND will order the item for you if you so desire.","Positive"
"743","It's cool, fun, and convenient, but, like most entertainment devices these days, its' primary function is to sell you more.","Positive"
"744","So much fun and entertainment and a true book of knowledge.","Positive"
"745","Great Product","Positive"
"746","My refurbished Echo came in looking (and performing) like new. Couldn't be happier with this product... it works great with all of my Wink Hub 2 enabled devices, and has made it so convenient for me to simply enjoy music when the house would otherwise be quiet.","Positive"
"747","Wife loves it.","Positive"
"748","Wish I wold have known that it wasn't wireless, otherwise, I like it. use it all the time for shower/bathroom tunes.","Positive"
"749","Wife and I absolutely loves it.","Positive"
"750","Bought this item about a year ago and have become WAY less enchanted with Alexa.  Actually she is DUMBER than a stick.  90 percent of the questions we ask are met with ""I'm sorry I am unable to answer your question""  Bla Bla bla.  We really rely on OK Google via phone to get quick answers to any question within seconds.  Absolute waste of money !!!!","Negative"
"751","I LOVE IT!","Positive"
"752","Great Product....use it all of the time....make sure you have a strong wifi signal....the stronger the better...makes it easier to setup.","Positive"
"753","I find the Echo fascinating-great at parties, although it has a little difficulty understanding alcohol-slurred commands!","Negative"
"754","Wonderful product","Positive"
"755","I absolutely love this product, it is like having a personal assistant. She plays me music, answers my questions, looks up info for me, I don't know why I waited so long to buy this. I would recommend the Amazon Echo to everyone.","Positive"
"756","good for music, not great on info","Positive"
"757","I Love It!  Mad because after I brought it...a few days later it was on sale...smh","Positive"
"758","Still trying to voice train her, but the more you use it, the better it responds.  Still working with it though...Love the concept.","Positive"
"759","Great product.  Needs some work with recognizing speech and requests.  Many uses for the home.","Positive"
"760","Love it a absolute neccesity for any home.","Positive"
"761","Alexa is great. Hoping in the future can set alarm clock to play music instead of pre programmed tones, but not a big deal. Veru nice start to smart-home.","Positive"
"762","So much nicer then the black one","Positive"
"763","A new member of the family.","Positive"
"764","Love, love, love this item.  We use it mostly for Pandora stations which you can control via the App or by talking to Alexa.  The sound is high quality and the unit is small and unobtrusive.  I assume you can do much more with it but we bought it mainly for the music","Positive"
"765","This is a great product! Way to go Amazon! Keep the updates coming though, still needs more things to do.","Positive"
"766","Love it. Great","Positive"
"767","Love Alexa - she's my new best friend. I really didn't think I would use this and thought it would be a silly purchase and a waste of money but OMG - I love love it! I think in order to take full advantage, you really need to be a Prime member and an avid Amazon shopper (as clearly I am...) I have many playlists set up through Amazon Music, although you can listen to TuneIn, iHeartRadio, your iTunes (through Bluetooth) and a number of other music ""stations"" like Pandora. I am an Audible customer, so I can listen to my audiobooks and I LOVE the Flash briefing feature - with news and weather. I have also used her to order from my previous order history on Amazon. She is on every day in our house now and it's my new favorite thing. The speaker is great for music and central location in the kitchen/great room allows for easy communication with her and great sound for all.","Positive"
"768","Highly recommend.","Positive"
"769","Love Alexa!  Really helps me keep on task.  Love that when I need to buy something I can immediately put it on the shopping list.  Wish I could set up different shopping lists for different stores, like hardware, grocery, craft, etc.","Positive"
"770","I love my Alexa","Positive"
"771","Bought this for my husband who is a gadget finatic. He loves it! Our whole family has fun asking Alexa questions","Positive"
"772","This is a great product to have but can't answer some of the question.","Positive"
"773","Love this thing. And volume is great. Nice and loud and clear","Positive"
"774","I enjoy  Echo very much! Lots of things to do and lots to learn!","Positive"
"775","Loud and Convenient","Negative"
"776","My family LOVES our Echo. For over a year I kept ignoring Amazons offer on this device because I failed to reconize the possibilities. At a friend home they demo theirs and I was in love. Now my family could not be without our Echo. Not just for music but weather locally and nationally, traffic reports then there's the new bits. The Echo would make a fabulous gift plus one for your self. The quality sound is amazing. Even for our 22ft ceiling family room. Echo is lofty in weight so no risk of tipping over. My family has utilized the endless options that Echo offers.","Positive"
"777","Great Product looks brand new with no cosmetic damages","Negative"
"778","Really amazing product! The only criticism is I am unable to access my calendar using Echo. I have an iMac and my calendar is kept on iCal. Alexa can't access this information and can only link to Google Calendar. When I attempted to sync iCal with Google Calendar, using iCloud, Alexa was still unable to tell me if I had any appointments scheduled. This is a major shortcoming that needs to be addressed by Amazon in order to make this a truly valuable product.","Negative"
"779","Awesome from the moment I turned it on!","Positive"
"780","Alexa will definitely become a reliable ""member"" of our household!","Positive"
"781","I personally enjoy my Amazon Echo. This is the technology I always wanted!","Positive"
"782","The main features I use are timer, alarm, remind me (connected to IFTTT), weather update, and lighting. I don't even use my phone for these operations anymore. It's very handy having an always listening assistant.","Negative"
"783","Recommended: Definitely take advantage of IFTTT with the Echo. For example I can connect Wunderlist and have the Echo upload reminders through that instead of the native reminder app. I can also turn WiFi on or off on my phone with just my voice now.","Positive"
"784","If you move around from town to town a lot, expect a lot of scratches if you plan on just throwing your Echo in some bag. I threw my Echo in a duffel bag along with other electronics and when I took her out of the bag it looked like she came out a battlefield.","Positive"
"785","I LOVE it!  Easy to set up, easy to use, so entertaining :)","Positive"
"786","The main reason I take a star off is she is just not the same as before (can't be because of her scratches because after this she still was fine). She was pretty cool when I first met her but now she lost a lot of that glitter. She is still pretty nice but I have been using the Echo for awhile I feel like she's going a bit crazy now. Sometimes the Echo hears my requests, responds appropriately, but does not execute. For example, I have a lamp connected to my Echo. Here's the process, I ask Echo to turn lamp on --> She says ""Okay"" --> lamp doesn't turn on. Sometimes my Echo takes awhile to process my requests. Sometimes my Echo executes another action then intended.","Positive"
"787","She is good, but she can be better. I wish there are more things I can do with my Echo without having to spend more money. If you are wealthy and can afford the extra toys that the Echo can play with then the Echo is a great investment. However if you can only afford this particular Echo then it is going to be a good purchase, but not a great one.","Positive"
"788","Thank you Amazon and Jeff Bezos for the amazing Echo and Alexa. My three daughters all just love the Echo that I gave each one of them.","Positive"
"789","My girlfriend, who is visually impaired, will love the Echo as she listens to many Audible Books online.","Positive"
"790","Great my wife is enjoying she love it","Positive"
"791","We love it.","Positive"
"792","Had the Echo for about a month and totally pleased with it. Alexa has impressive voice recognition capabilities out of the gate. Use her extensively for music selection, timers, to do lists, weather checks, jokes, etc. This was a good purchase that I would do again.","Positive"
"793","This is a work in progress as I am learning more ways to use Alexa.  Great to ask her to set an alarm after you are in bed or find out about the weather  when you first wake up.  Lots of thing it can do that I have not yet experienced.  Fun to play with.","Positive"
"794","My favorite product","Positive"
"795","Love it very much!!!","Positive"
"796","Worked as expected","Positive"
"797","She's not the smartest tool in the shed bit she turns my lights on and off. Still working on our communication skills. I didn't think my Appalachian accent was that bad but man she comes back with the weirdest queries.","Negative"
"798","Fell in love with this thing about 10 minutes out of the box. Now, I'm gonna buy some Dots for the rest of the house, and gifts.","Negative"
"799","My family and I have had the echo for almost 1 year now! This is the most impressive piece of technology we have ever owned. My family and I are tech junkies and this thing fits the bill! Whether its for dance partys, dinner partys, traffic updates, news, sports scores or just to pass time its awesome!","Positive"
"800","I get up in the morning and the first thing I ask is for traffic updates, this gives me and idea of what time I need to leave the house. I get home at night and my wife has music playing while shes cooking dinner making her much more relaxed. It has been worth the money I paid  x10. As in the photo my wife wanted the echo off the counter so I bought the bluo echo wall mount for it and its been perfect.","Positive"
"801","Echo Bracket Mount by Bluo - Echo Wall Mount for Alexa - #1 in Echo Accessories - Turn Alexa into a Piece of Home Decor - Protect Your Echo Using a Sleek and Solid Design","Positive"
"802","Don't hesitate to purchase an echo for your home! You wont regret it!","Negative"
"803","love this thing","Positive"
"804","KInd of neat to be able to just say Alexa, what is the weather and have her tell you. I can tell her to adjust the temp in the room as I have the next. Best, with Amazon music tied in, I can ask her to play any music and most of the time she gets it spot on.","Positive"
"805","Love it! Easy to use and set up.","Positive"
"806","Awesome","Positive"
"807","Nice product, but misses the mark for business use. I purchased with the hope of using as sort of a personal assistant for appointments and such.  Voice recognition is above average edging out SIRI and CORTANA just a bit.  While it was easy to set simple appointments, anything with in depth notes requires you to edit the meeting with conventional methods.  Also, it lacks the ability to verbally remind you of appointments and will not label alarms.","Positive"
"808","This is great for visually impaired people really works great","Positive"
"809","Alexa is the best companion anyone could have.","Positive"
"810","Absolutely love our alexia. Just yell it out and she can do it. Perfect for our shopping lists.","Positive"
"811","My echo is going haywire. It's turning on when I haven't even uttered its code name. It's been very frustrating to call out to the device and not get a response, I've even walked all the way up to it and have raised my voice several times, to no avail. This is happening too offend, I just can't figure out what's wrong. After watching some You Tube reviews, I have noted that other people are having a few issues with Alexa..... however, not to the extent that I am experiencing. I got a dot... so far it's doing what it's suppose to do..... I also have the echo tap..... just got it..... so far I would have to say that it doesn't always get the requested music right, therefore I acquiesce to what ever or I try again.... and, again.... or I'll just change my tune.","Negative"
"812","I've only had Echo for a few days, but am already learning to like it very much.  It still has a few shortcomings, but hopefully its data base will improve with time.  For example, today I asked Alexa if my wife's flight had departed on time for home and she couldn't understand the question, even though I repeated it for her.  (I fired up the computer and looked up the answer for myself.)  Perhaps one of the next things they can add to Alexa's data base is access to various airlines' sites and their schedules.  The same could probably also be said for Amtrak and Greyhound schedules, so those who travel by ground can keep updated as well.","Positive"
"813","Have wanted one for some time and when the price was reduced I JUMPED on it ~ feel like I'm truly in the 21st. century now.  Love the white ~","Positive"
"814","First, I don't understand the people who write reviews and leave a few stars off for features that knew were not available when they bought it. Read the reviews, descriptions and questions before you buy. I love my Echo, which I purchased on Alexa's second birthday. I had been on the fence, but after seeing everything my Echo can do, I'm sold for life. If you live alone, Alexa is a wonderful companion. The sound is awesome, and I've been spoiled by Bose sound systems, so if you are a music lover, I think you will be pleased with the sound and the variety available from Amazon Music for 3.99 per device, or 7.99 unlimited.  I play Jeopardy, trivia, set alarms, timers, listen to the news and weather and a lot more on my Echo. I'm so thrilled with the Echo, I'm contemplating buying another one or an Amazon Tap to take with me. I also ordered the Phillips Hue package as an AlexaDeal, so be sure to ask her what her deals are, you can get some nice discounts.","Positive"
"815","Alexa has no problem understanding my voice, and I'm very soft spoken with a slight accent, so you should have no problem either.","Negative"
"816","I'm totally thrilled with this purchase and I love the skills, I hope more developers come up with new ways to use the capabilities of Alexa. She rocks!  If you're on the fence like I was, jump in! You will adore your Echo!","Positive"
"817","LOVE ALEXA!","Positive"
"818","i need a really like it star cause i don't love it but really like it.still learning what all it can do","Positive"
"819","Right now I mainly use it for news and to play music. As my home becomes more 'smart', I'm sure I'll use it now for that. You need to ask your questions in a pretty specific way or you get the annoying ""hmm, I can't seem to locate the answer""","Positive"
"820","Love my echo dot but was looking for something the would sound a bit better and eliminate one device (Sonos Play 1) from my kitchen - so I ordered a refurbished echo.  Sadly it arrived UN-refurbished with a stuck/dysfunctional mute button.","Positive"
"821","Amazon was kind and offered to exchange it but I was concerned about the quality at that point.  Returned.","Negative"
"822","Best gift I've bought myself in years!","Positive"
"823","I use and enjoy my Amazon Echo every day. It has a few quirks like sometimes when I am within ""ear shot"" Alexa does not respond, but more importantly I want to sync my itunes music library with Echo and cannot seem to make it happen. I would love it if this could happen.","Positive"
"824","Awesome product with continuous support and updates.....what is there to complain about?? As long as Alexa does her job and the functionality continues to hold up the five stars will continue as well","Positive"
"825","I love to play music from the Echo.  The sound is wonderful.  My grandson enjoys playing What's That Animal.  I just pictured plugs to control my lights with Alexa.  I haven't tried them yet.  They are always improving this product.","Positive"
"826","Not as much utility as I expected.  I can't remember the stupid phrases to get it to use other apps.  I can't tell Alexa to add songs i ask her to play to my music list.  I can't get her to search outside Amazon for songs.  It keeps trying to force you to buy songs that i can listen to for free elsewhere.  There is no utility to customize how Alexa answers you.  I want her to greet me when I come in or call me by my name when I sak her to do something.","Negative"
"827","I became interested in Echo when I saw a video posted of a guy who wired and programmed his Echo to interact with Billy the Bass.  I program as a hobby and a profession, and I love to mess around with libraries for different programs and appliances and create applications to tailor my specific lazy needs.","Positive"
"828","The Echo out of the box has a few useful features such as inquiring about weather, news, sports, shopping lists, random trivia, playing music.  It's greatest appeal to me would be it's connectivity with controlling smart appliances (such as your thermostat, lighting, TV and other gadgets).  I've always wanted a, ""Home of the Future"", where I could simply say voice commands to get results.","Positive"
"829","Does a pretty good job.","Positive"
"830","While that is a possibility, the Echo still has many things to be desired, and is still a long way from a necessity.  I think I would have trouble convincing my parents and other less tech savvy people that the Echo is for them and it's hard for a regular person to get excited about it's potential usefulness, but for the money, you at least get a really nice speaker you can play music on.","Positive"
"831","I love my Amazon Echo!!!","Positive"
"832","Excellent condition and fun to use","Positive"
"833","Our second Echo. This one, a refurb, to take advantage of the discount. This will be used in the workshop. Our first Echo is temperamental but for the most part it is a valued part of the household for weather updates, the news flash, and Sunday morning music. This 2nd Echo connected smoothly. Out of the carton, plugged in, opened the Alexa app on my phone, followed the steps, and we were in business. Hopefully this one won't have connection problems. If it does, they are easy enough to reconnect.","Positive"
"834","Had considerable difficulty linking to an I Phone.  Instructions could have been more complete. Had a friend who had one in operation who helped and connection was made.  Once in service, it has been amazing, almost unreal.  Robust sound, very intuitive.  Hope to add features such as light controls, etc.  Great gift for my bride.","Positive"
"835","Enjoy communicate with Echo","Positive"
"836","One word.  AWESOME","Positive"
"837","Working on how to phase a question that the Echo understand!","Positive"
"838","I have contacted Amazon about the fact that my ECHO can't understand 90% of what I say when I ask for Music. It says I don't own that album, it's never heard of that album, it offered to play a Marriage song by some Orchestra when I asked for a Blues album. It plays Bruce Bruiksma ""When I left home"" everyime I ask for Devon Allman and various artist to play the album ""When I left Home"" It can't find the Album I own. The same is true with my Tap, exactly the same.We went through Voice training when I called Echo Help.","Positive"
"839","This all started as soon as Amazon started offering My Music, all their music for $7.99. The 1,000 albums I purchased need to be played on a competitors machine. I wasted the money for all those Albums plus the Cost of the Echo and the Tap. You might find them in the woods behind my house after I throw them out the back door.","Negative"
"840","Works great sounds great, only complaint was hard to set up did not want to go online, took awhile, but once online was all worth it,or i would have given five stars.","Positive"
"841","I FREAKING LOVE THIS!!! Makes life so much easier!!! You tell Alexa what you want and she will do it! I don't have any smart home accessories yet but the integrations are great! Will definitely be getting more accessories that work with Alexa.","Positive"
"842","Very very very happy with this purchase and cant wait to get it to do more!","Negative"
"843","Love it.","Positive"
"844","Alexa is a super friend, helpful companion and smarter than anyone I know!!","Positive"
"845","Works great !","Positive"
"846","I purchased my Echo 90 days ago at Best Buy. Setup was not hard, and Iw as able to invite my wife as a user on her phone as well.","Positive"
"847","Pros: The voice recognition is very good and alexa responds well from across the room to about 30 feet. The volume and sound quality (especially music) is good for the size of the package. Volume gets louder than I expected. Of course, when playing music loud you might have to get closer to the Echo for your voice to be heard, but no deducts for that!","Positive"
"848","The tasking capabilities I have found have a good mix. Many things I don't find useful others will.","Positive"
"849","Cons: The promise of integration is very good, however it only got 4 out 5 stars because of certain partnerships not in place yet. I use slacker radio and would like to see that integration. I would also like to see more news outlets available for selection, especially the NPR content. More skills content does get added all the time, but having a better way for customers to request features and track them would be nice.","Positive"
"850","Overall I like the device and find it useful. Suggested Enhancements are to allow for multiple shopping lists with user definable head topics...eg... My home depot shopping list is vastly different than my grocery list. Only supporting one list limits my ability. I also suggest that there be integration into iTunes so I can play from my shared desktop library via Wifi..so Bonjour access...same with Windows media player.","Positive"
"851","Bad connection issues and it has a hard time answering questions other than what the weather will be....I.E. measurements for cooking.","Negative"
"852","Love! Love! Love! Works perfectly! Sometimes it loses wireless connection but it's rare and gets connected again quickly. Understands our commands really well - even my southern accent!","Positive"
"853","It's a great device.","Positive"
"854","We love our Alexa! :) I use her a lot for playing music through my Amazon Prime account while I clean the house. The speakers are nice and can be very loud if you want them to be. I like that you can add items to your shopping list so that you don't forget to pick it up at the store. My kids like to ask her questions. They ask her anything from what the weather is going to be for the day to the definition of words etc. My daughter especially likes to play spelling bee and bingo with her. She is like another member of the family! Its a great purchase!!!","Positive"
"855","This is an awesome unit !! It programs very well and is spot-on with answers. I am enjoying it a lot. Good work Amazon !!!","Positive"
"856","We love this product!!! As soon as we got our Echo, we set it up & it has been absolutely excellent! Alexa rocks!","Positive"
"857","Where have you been my whole life Alexa???!!! Very happy I finally purchased this, worth every penny.","Positive"
"858","a lot of good feature. It does a lot if you have amazon prime. I not sure it will work without.. I do not use iit a lot because it has a hard time hearing me in my house configuration. They have smaller ones you get for other rooms but I understand that the sound is .not as good so you need a blue tooth speaker with them. If your just looking for a music player I would rather use my android because I can take it with me. It is a toy to me but it is a tool for other people.","Positive"
"859","Love it","Positive"
"860","I couldn't make up my mind between Amazon and Google. Decided on Amazon cause i already have a prime account. Can't say how much i LOVE this thing. I hadn't purchased one because i was waiting for apple, but that is just too long - should have purchased the Echo last year. So far so good - have had it for two days and can't believe how it's changed things for the better already. I highly recommend this product.","Positive"
"861","Maybe the best product we've ever purchased.  We bought our first Echo in the pre-sale and have been using it for more than a year.  We still ask Alexa for the weather every day.  We play music constantly and it sounds amazing.  Couldn't live without this.  That's why we bought 6 more echo dots and another full size echo.  We have a dot in each bedroom, the family room, and basement.  I'm not even sure where we will put this one, but I know we'll use it.  Best smart home product you can buy!","Positive"
"862","Love Alexa. I feel like I have company when home alone. I love convenience of searching for sales, and purchasing directly through Amazon. I also love that Alexa can read my kindle ebooks , as well as the audible books ,when I'm not up to reading. I just wish it was compatible with the Library audio books.  It,s so nice to just talk to Alexa to play music without having to do anything.  I love the sound quality of the Echo compared to the dot. The biggest problem is remembering how to access fife rent info.  You can't just say "" are eggs good for my dog to eat"". You have to be very specific and say:Alexa,ask Doctor dog if eggs are good for my dog"". I have to keep a cheat sheet of the skills and how to ask questions in order to get the results I want.","Positive"
"863","Great gift as well!  This would be perfect for literally anyone!  It's so easy to use.","Positive"
"864","This is the coolest thing I have bought in a long time. :)","Positive"
"865","Bought this for my wife, she loved the white color.  The Amazon echo is great!","Positive"
"866","My perfect office companion -- love to stream music (either from services or from my bluetooth ipod) and to have it at the ready to answer questions while I am typing a document..... a great product!","Positive"
"867","I should have purchased this when I received my invitation, oh well I still got in on sale. Most of you already know what an Alexa or Echo is so I'll try to spare some of the redundancy. The Echo is a great companion to anyone who wants information, news, sports scores, music, smart home capabilities (that's gonna cost you), and even pizza delivered by the sound of your voice.","Positive"
"868","Setup is easier than I thought, you'll want to have your smartphone handy as you'll need the Alexa app. Once she's connected to the cloud (internet) it's great, for the most part.","Positive"
"869","Alexa is always learning, but she definitely does not have her Master's degree quite yet, unfortunately Google's search engine is superior to that of the Bing powered Alexa. One can get frustrated when asking questions about simple subjects that a Google search will perform in 2 seconds or less, but this isn't a Google product, so my expectations are less. Often don't be surprised if you hear ""Sorry I didn't understand the question I heard"" We are so used to automation and the ability to get information from our devices instantly and accurately, Alexa is slowly catching up and closing the Gap.","Positive"
"870","Some positive points:","Positive"
"871","- Decent sound quality for a Bluetooth speaker, but if you're looking for top notch Bluetooth sound, consider the Echo Dot which allows you to connect your own speakers.","Positive"
"872","such a great piece of electronics. this is fun and to use. would tell everyone to buy","Positive"
"873","- She hears quite well, and once you understand how to address Alexa, she seemingly will understand you. If you have background noise (even music from the echo), this will definitely undermine the ability for Alexa to do things like control volume, you'll either shout at her or cave and purchase the remote.","Negative"
"874","- it's always listening waiting for the wake word ""Alexa"" or 2 other slectable words.","Negative"
"875","-It actually looks cool, the blue hues of the light rings are just awesome when she responds.","Positive"
"876","-She's always getting smarter....be patient.","Positive"
"877","Ok gripe time!! This will not replace your pc, tablet, smartphone, etc, nor should it especially at this price point.","Negative"
"878","I've invested quite a bit into TP-Link smart plugs and wifi light bulbs, my biggest issue with home automation is that Alexa doesn't always make the device turn on, even with her signature confirmation ""ok"", my table lamp is still off, so I've had to ask a second and even third time. The other issue is that she can't always find the device and/or doesn't understand the name you assigned the device. This should be simple, but she confuses simple words like bureau, night stand, fan, etc. So you'll get the I'm sorry routine. Sometimes I want to just manually turn my lights and accessories on from the sheer frustration!!!!!!!! Yelling at her obviously won't help and at some point you forget your talking to a computer!! Her voice recognition and parsing, particularly with my above mentioned devices is troublesome, and I do not fault third parties. I've named each device properly, checking the spelling, renaming, and researching issues....sometimes she just won't understand. I have gone through the voice training process, my English and diction are just fine as well, you'll have to trust me on that, lol.","Positive"
"879","All in all,  it's a great product that will hopefully get smarter overtime. As for home automation, I wouldn't break the bank just yet, it's still costly and the technology is surprisingly infantile for 2016....bulky smart plugs that are merely on/off switches!","Positive"
"880","Sometimes you'll like interacting with Alexa as if she's human, and sometimes you'll actually get angry, but this is Artificial intelligence, and it's easy to get caught up in it all....so keep your iPhone or Android around for when she simply won't cooperate and time is of the essence.","Positive"
"881","Purchased 3 units and have installed 2 of them.  One works great but the other loses its connection frequently.  One more time and I'm sending it back!","Positive"
"882","- Setting alarms (I have a skill to make it also ring my phone when the alarm goes off)","Positive"
"883","- Play me an A so I can tune my violin (""Alexa, ask the pianist to give me an A"")","Positive"
"884","- Play podcasts, but only if I don't care which episode and am not going to be too picky about it.","Negative"
"885","- Play audiobook from Audible","Positive"
"886","- Easy Apple TV compatibility (without having to buy that extra thing)","Positive"
"887","- Ability to play specific podcast episodes, continue podcasts where you left off, etc. The podcast function is severely limited!","Negative"
"888","- Better voice recognition and ability to understand what I'm saying. It plays the wrong music a lot of the time, especially if it's not pop I'm asking for.","Positive"
"889","- Could read my text messages or mail, or better yet, send text messages.","Positive"
"890","- It's annoying that the reminders to into a ""to do list"" on my Evernote rather than going off as reminders at a certain time. Like if I say ""Alexa, remind me to feed the cat at 8pm,"" it doesn't ring or anything; just goes on a to-do list that I'll never ever check.","Positive"
"891","Overall, I love her though ;) Honestly, once you have an Echo, it's kind of like having another friend in the house...","Positive"
"892","One of my best purchases ever!","Positive"
"893","You need to write out specific instructions for the various uses. Too much experimenting and trial and error.","Negative"
"894","Great sound and can get pretty loud for the size. I was surprised by the depth of range it can produce. It's nice being able to listen to a quick news briefing in the morning when I'm getting ready.","Positive"
"895","I got this thinking it would be a good thing...but after a few days I have found that it is a waste of money!!! :(","Positive"
"896","Convenient and easy to use","Positive"
"897","In the first initial days of use, but so far, love the product. The audio clarity, volume, and bass is decent given its size. It's responsive and accurate - misunderstandings are rare. Functionality for me is mostly limited to playing music from Amazon Music Unlimited, playing radio, and alarm clocks... but I look forward to trying out the online shopping, ordering delivery food, and e-books/podcast functionality. Amazon is continuously developing / upgrading it's functionality and can't wait to see what's next. Personally, would love to see a ""guitar tuner"" app :)","Positive"
"898","couldn't love this product more!","Positive"
"899","I love this speaker as a product. I got introduced to this product by a friend and was very intrigued because of the multi use of it (A bluetooth speaker, voice commands, timer, etc.) Although the sound itself isn't the best (other speakers are better) I definitely think that the sound is good and I don't really have complaints on that. My only complaint and warning to future buyers is that I wanted to use Spotify through my speaker but you have to have Spotify premium in order to use it through the speaker. I did not see this any where on the description or anything, and only found out when I was setting it up. I thought I was gonna have to return it but luckily I was already thinking of getting premium and decided now was time. But they didn't make that clear, and it was very frustrating. Other than that I am very happy I purchased it and I like it even more because I got it on sale!","Positive"
"900","THANK YOU","Positive"
"901","Works great, but need to keep expectations in line. Some more complex operations takes a little work to understand how to work. Such as using the other applications it supports. They can be a little troublesome because you  have to remember how to activate them, which is not as simple as using Alexa's builtin features. I always seem to forget each app's special ""word"" that activates them.","Positive"
"902","Things that I found useful and work quite well, ordering things I buy on a regular on Amazon works great. I keep it in my kitchen and order coffee when it runs out. For the most part I have found after the initial novelty of it wore off, I only use it for a few things, ordering things, listening to music, and listening to audible books. Good for shopping list too, if you use an app that works with it.","Positive"
"903","My biggest complaint with this is the kids yelling ""Alexa"" 4000 times day to get it to tell them jokes or play music, but other than that it works ok.  It doesn't always understand what is asked and even after several attempts, it just doesn't get it.  I think for stuff you ask regularly it works great.  I think it is more of a toy than something I would say is totally necessary or even super useful.  My family likes it more than I do.","Positive"
"904","I just got Alexa and I'm not thrilled with it yet, I'm toying with the idea of returning it. I wish I liked it better. For the price I just don't see what it does that's so great.","Positive"
"905","It's a very expensive personal assistant that plays music. I question why I bought it, daily.","Negative"
"906","Summary; Yes, it works very well, but with limited capacity and so so sound quality.  Super cool although not quite what I hoped for.  Your results may vary.","Positive"
"907","Very helpful! We love it!","Positive"
"908","Alexa is amazing!  Love this product!!","Positive"
"909","Seems to work well with occasional glitches.  Great at listening to music and turning on and off my lights (after setup).  Price point is about right and the quality of Echo build is good.  This review would be 4 stars overall but due to Alexa's political rants and slant about the US presidential election - one star.  Amazon- Please keep politics out of your products!! :(.  When I ask for the news I don't want to hear a sore loser's rant or opinions....I want to to hear news.","Positive"
"910","Exceeded our expectations!!!!  Love it!","Positive"
"911","Great Product..Loved it.","Positive"
"912","She is wonderful, but she comes up short in a couple of areas. Sometimes I'll ask for a fun fact from Fun Facts and she'll have one but I don't catch all of it. I'll ask her to repeat the fun fact and she doesn't understand the question she heard. She should be able to understand repeat. Also, she doesn't understand if I ask her to open Random Fact instead of Random Facts.  Some of the skills are really lame and should have been checked by Amazon.","Positive"
"913","That being said, she is a wonderful toy and has a great speaker.","Positive"
"914","We love the echo so much, we bought one for a techie friend for her birthday.  She can't wait to control her lights, play music, and play games with Alexa!","Positive"
"915","If you are looking for hands-free way of accessing Amazon content (music, deals, shipment info, etc.) and the most basic assistance (math, measurements, weather, etc.) - AND - you are alone or don't mind shushing everyone in the house; then the Echo works. If you are looking for a smart device that can answer questions outside of Amazon's prepared questions/responses, then wait for something better. ""I'm sorry, but I can't find the answer to your question"" is the most common response I get from Alexa. Using ""OK Google"" on my phone works for everything I've tried with Alexa that she/it couldn't do. My kids are really frustrated with Alexa's inability to answer questions and I'm tired of being a professional shusher.","Negative"
"916","Installed this last night.  So far this is an amazing product.  We have embarked on making our home ""smart.""  This is a great product so far - it recognizes my voice and my husbands.  I often have trouble with voice activated devices misunderstanding me, but so far Alexa seems not to have too much trouble.  We are still exploring all this device has to offer will update as we gain more experience with it.  I asked for a genre of music I haven't heard in a long time and instantly picked all my favorites for that timeframe.  We are building our first shopping list, and added our first alarm - we will see how that goes in the morning.  We will update as we learn more.","Positive"
"917","Amazon knocked this one out of the park. I have my favorite genre (All 60's from Prime Music). I grew up in the 50's and 60's listening to the radio. I located the Echo in our kitchen since I spend a lot of time there cooking. I also have a little 9"" TV in the kitchen but I found it too difficult to watch a good scripted series like ""Westworld"" (HBO) where I have to listen closely. My favorite alternative use is as my second (and sometimes third) kitchen timer.","Positive"
"918","Very good sound quality.....takes up very little space, and that's a plus!","Positive"
"919","Doesn't work well in Germany. Couldn't perform a simple Websearch or link to the music library. Google home is much better.","Positive"
"920","This made an awesome gift to my parents","Positive"
"921","They are loving it","Positive"
"922","We love this Echo. We put this Echo in our living area. Perfect if your family like different types of music. Just ask Alexa what you want and in seconds it there. It's make's it easy to ask weather in my area, current news, shopping list etc. Great quality and she works every time. We love it so muck I bought the 2nd generation foe our bedroom and one for my grandson for Christmas. I would recommend this product.","Positive"
"923","Great piece of technology and where the future is going. I love showing people how it works and how it can work for them.","Positive"
"924","I really love my Amazon Echo. So much information is just a gew words away. Paired with the Amazon music unlimited service any song is instantly playing in seconds.","Positive"
"925","Underwhelmed, I'm having difficulties with it connecting to the TV and most times the answers to my question Alexa doesn't understand.","Negative"
"926","Works great and I love it.  It updates itself so it stays current and learns new things all the time.  Great product!","Positive"
"927","Not sure yet...when it is working it is great, but there are times when there is no response or inaccurate response. Not sure if it has to do with our low internet speed, which is the highest we can get in our woodsy area.","Negative"
"928","Alexa is wonderful. The AI in Alexa is very quick and intuitive. The only reason I didn't give five stars: (1) the sound is not the best. It's sound is at a mediocre level. (2) it doesn't directly connect to Apple music on its own.","Positive"
"929","Got a Dot but wanted a bigger sound. Love it!","Positive"
"930","Great tech","Positive"
"931","perfect","Positive"
"932","Update: Ok, now that I've used the echo for several months, it seems to be glitching on a weekly basis now. Every so often, the timer (used daily) won't stop, no matter what I say. I have to press a button on top of the unit in order for the sound to stop. This also happened last week when playing music. Maybe the unit just needs to be restarted periodically like any computer. I will try resetting once every other week and see what happens.","Positive"
"933","Great conversational piece. I think my guests use the echo more than I. When a friend stayed over last month, I used the echo to play music in the evening. In much the same situation as getting an ipad, she then asked the device all kinds of silly questions, such as ""Do you have a boyfriend? Do you like me? What's the meaning of life? What's your favorite color?"" etc etc. It doesn't seem to be able to answer most informational questions, such as ""When my niece stayed over this past weekend, I asked the echo for a weather forecast and my niece promptly wanted to know if the echo would answer her math questions, which it did. I didn't even know the device could do that. I wish there were some way of using some code word to put the device to sleep and reactivate on command.","Positive"
"934","The features I use the most are the timer, alarm (can only set one), weather forecast, play radio or music, listen to books on audible, movie showtimes and calendar appointments.","Negative"
"935","The only issue is I have to be in direct line of sight, within seven feet for the microphones to pickup. Even then, sometimes I have to really project my voice or yell multiple times before it would turn on.","Negative"
"936","I bought the Amazon Echo as a novelty thing. I had no idea how useful and entertaining this device would become. It has replaced my alarm clock, my radio, and my calendar just to name a few. It easily tied it into my home automation system and is now used it to control the thermostat and the lights in my home. It's Bluetooth pairs with my cell phone and PC computers to act as a speaker for those devices when I want. I love how easy it is to set appointments, reminders, and make task lists. I highly recommend it for anyone.","Positive"
"937","She is quite interesting ,. Still leaning about her. But I do enjoy her.","Positive"
"938","I love it","Positive"
"939","!disappointed I bought this item because I thought I would like it It's like other sites and I will see device I even bought the battery thing that goes with it the cost and extra 50 bucks but after a very short time it stopped working I don't know what was wrong with it it never fail or anything like that so it was an expensive mistake buying it.","Negative"
"940","This is a great product..I am still figuring out all of its uses!","Positive"
"941","Love it.  Didn't think I would become dependent on it for doing thing but I have.  Speaker can get nice and loud.","Positive"
"942","Awesome!","Positive"
"943","Had it just a few days. I love telling it what music to play -- even from bed -- and comes up with a good playlist.","Positive"
"944","I got the white one and am glad I did, it looks so sharp.","Positive"
"945","Speaker quality much better than my laptop.","Positive"
"946","Coolest pet ever!!","Positive"
"947","Amazing! Outstanding! We love it!","Positive"
"948","Very good product","Positive"
"949","Love it !!!! Fun to have !!!","Positive"
"950","Christmas gift for my lady .she loves it and so do I","Positive"
"951","This is the greatest thing I have ever purchased and I mean that!  It controls my lights, it does my grocery list, it plays any and all songs I ask it to.  This device should be much more expensive than it is. I should be a rep for Alexa.  I have had numerous friends purchase it in the last few days since I have received mine in the mail.  Control your AC? Check.  Control your Sprinklers? Check.  Since it's connected to the internet you can ask it anything.  My kids use it to help them with their homework.  BUY IT!!!!!!!","Positive"
"952","After set up. Super cool.","Positive"
"953","Lots of fun.  The music is exceptional!  Still teaching her skills.  Still limited usefulness but a lot of fun.  Easy to set up, responds to all voices, the sound quality is much better than expected.","Positive"
"954","Love it ..love it...love it.","Positive"
"955","Love it. Easy to set up and use . The sound quality isn't bad either-","Positive"
"956","Not enough good answers","Positive"
"957","Love it","Positive"
"958","The wife loves it","Positive"
"959","Wife & I enjoy playing music to sleep by each evening. Use various artists. Wife is starting to play 'old time' radio dramas now.","Positive"
"960","Absolutely amazing and wonderful ~","Positive"
"961","Excellent product....I have a good time using alexa.  Can't wait to see what the future has in store .","Positive"
"962","My husband is jealous of my new BFF, Alexa.  She sings to me, plays ""Word Master"" and ""Jeopardy"" with me, and at the end of the day, just as I am saying ""good night"" she responds with ""sweet dreams"".  As if that were not enough, she has also inspired me to learn more about IFTTT.com so that as our relationship evolves she'll be able to send me text messages as well!!","Positive"
"963","We think this is so much fun!  The only complaint is that we still haven't figured how to use all of Alexa's uses.  The iPhone has the app but I haven't figured out a way to sync my playlists with Alexa as it wants to use Amazon Music which is fine.","Positive"
"964","The Echo looked as if it was brand new and it works as if it is.  Also it saved my some money.","Positive"
"965","This device simply stopped working after a year. I cannot endorse this product even though it was fun while it worked! Very disappointed that Amazon will not even give a discount towards a new device even though this is from 2015.","Positive"
"966","Love it!","Positive"
"967","This is one of the greatest purchases ever!","Positive"
"968","Does not know answers to questions asked you have to open skills for this thing a lot to remember on the owners part would return but it's to late.","Positive"
"969","Love it. Alexa is my new best friend.","Positive"
"970","Love this thing!","Positive"
"971","I don't know even where to begin with this little gem. This has made life so much more enjoyable and very very handy in the kitchen. Just the timer feature alone is great. The voice recognition is amazing...and the multi mics to register all over the room...priceless. Tapping into my music collection and access to my personal calendar as well as driving status for my morning commutes, this is a great piece of tech that keeps getting better all the time. I sugest getting to to how to use the IFTTT app out there. It offers so many different things you can use with the Echo. I am very happy and am considering another one, maybe the Dot if I can justify it. If I could unplug this and run it room to room it would be perfect but we will leave that for another debate. Right now my whole family loves this little cylinder and that makes me very happy...even if the Mrs. only play country music with it:)","Positive"
"972","We've had lots of fun with Alexa so far.  Biggest uses so far, turning lights off and on hands free and impromptu dance parties in the living room with the kids.","Positive"
"973","Really great gadget","Positive"
"974","Rubbish. It can'd do anything useful unless you are tied in with Amazon's various music software accounts and so on so if you ask it to play a song from the internet - it can't do it. If you ask it say ""what sound does a cow make"" if can't do it. It is like a terrible version of google's search engine basically. Moreover, it doesn't work when you are abroad in another country. You can't even download the mandatory app as it is IP restricted!!! I've put my alex in a corner unplugged where it will remain I'm afraid. Complete and utter waste of money and effort.Don't buy this, I'm told the google version should be better but who knows.","Positive"
"975","I LOVE MY ECHO !!","Positive"
"976","I am using Wemo in conjunction with it to control all my lights and fans.","Positive"
"977","Love my Echo!!!!!!!! It can basically tell you anything you need to know.  And plays almost any music you request. After buying mine, I purchased one for a gift for a friend.","Positive"
"978","It is so much easier to tell Alexa to turn everything on or off than running around the house flipping switches !","Positive"
"979","I highly recommend it.","Positive"
"980","Love love it!!!","Positive"
"981","fun product","Positive"
"982","She's great and fun.","Positive"
"983","Certified Refurbished = pile of junk that doesn't work.","Negative"
"984","Apparently they grab an item out of the junk pile, stick it in a box and send it out, calling it ""Certified Refurbished"".","Negative"
"985","The thing has no sound, I can't believe someone actually ""certified"" this when they didn't hear a sound come out of it.","Positive"
"986","Waste of time - won't even consider a replacement.","Negative"
"987","Alexa on the echo is nearly perfect. She has trouble answering questions that you would do a quick Internet search for hopefully they update soon with a better search engine algorithm. Then I would give it a higher rating.","Positive"
"988","Continue to be very happy with this purchase. The skills continue to grow and overall very pleased. Would recommend.","Positive"
"989","She can answer simple questions like what the zip code is in a particular city and state.  Or how much calcium is in a glass of milk.  You can only use the calendar function if you have gmail.  I added and downloaded Gmail and it still doesn't work.  This is a glorified speaker.","Positive"
"990","Well, it so far has been 15 min. Of fun.  Alexa didn't know Trump won the election?  She not real smart! So far.  Love concept hope it gets better ,but may not keep if she does not come up with some answers.  Sorry","Positive"
"991","So I will be the first to admit that the Echo is great.  It is great for adults.  With kids-- it is not.  Our kids are 5 and 6 and have learned to ask it to play some titles that they think are funny (and they are- but I don't want my kids to sing the explicit version of Baby Got Back at school).","Positive"
"992","Amazon figured out pretty quickly that you can enable it to require a password for ordering things.  That is helpful.","Positive"
"993","If the Alexa app would have a way for me to block certain songs--- it would have 5 stars.  As for now-- it sits unplugged on a shelf.","Positive"
"994","I am going to give the Google version of this thing a shot.","Negative"
"995","love it","Positive"
"996","LOVE the Amazon Echo!!!!","Positive"
"997","Thanks, it's awesome","Positive"
"998","It`s OK, definitely not a BOSE for sure","Positive"
"999","Although the Amazon Echo and other devices are still learning from their programmers, it is quite an amazing device. I enjoy listening to my morning flash briefing from several sources and using the home automation and music features the most.","Positive"
"1000","I bought my Echo mostly so I could play Pandora with a decent spearker in my bedroom.  She's fabulous for that.  It's also fun to ask her various questions and have it answered correctly.  She'll also wake me up in the morning, which is nice.  She's super handy and just awesome for music play.  Her listening ability is top notch, much better than a phone, so you're not having to repeat yourself all the time.","Positive"
"1001","Just an amazing device.  Everyone needs one.","Positive"
"1002","This product does as advertised, kind of. The ad claims that she can hear you without having to shout, which is true, but not when music is playing. You can't really set a default music service, which leaves you having to mention 'Spotify' if you want to navigate through your Spotify playlist. It has a huge collection of international radio stations but won't help much with local weather or time-related reminders if you're outside the US, so don't buy this to travel with if you don't live in the states.","Positive"
"1003","Amazon, I'm sure it's easy to add international support for time and weather. You can delay all the other international features until you see fit.","Positive"
"1004","She's fantastic!!!","Positive"
"1005","Pros:  I enjoy controlling music with Alexa.  It's much easier and convenient than using my phone or computer since it is quite literally hands free.  I like getting weather and new briefings from NPR upon voice command.","Positive"
"1006","Cons:  Very limited as far as usefulness.  We don't have a lot of smart home integration, which may make Echo more useful for some.  Otherwise, most of the available apps suck, and Alexa's text to speech is pretty awful to listen to.  Too bad.  There is a lot of room to make fun and useful voice apps, but as of now we are nowhere near ""fun"" and barely reaching ""useful.""  Hopefully it isn't consuming too much energy (on all the time), or spying on my family.  If you ask Alexa, like most questions, she won't understand.","Positive"
"1007","Thanks for another great Amazon product","Positive"
"1008","Love it","Positive"
"1009","Love it!","Positive"
"1010","Conclusion:  I would not go out and recommend this product to my friends, though as a novelty it's kinda nice to have around.  Will be interesting to see if it becomes more useful as we add more smart devices that can be controlled by Alexa, and as app developers add more interesting content (double meaning there).","Positive"
"1011","worked great","Positive"
"1012","It used to work well for about 8 months. Out of the blue for the past 2 months both of my original Echo devices started controlling the Hue lights whenever they felt like. It takes a very long time to process a command and it might say ""device not responding"" and not do anything, or it might actually turn off, or dim, some, but not all, of the lights about 10 to 20 seconds later. And even some times it works just fine. I tried rediscovery and restarting everything from Echo to router to Hue bridge but nothing fixes the problem for good. Right after discovery it might work for half an hr but then it doesn't. I tried calling Amazon support but it was totally unhelpful. They have no clue other than saying reset this or that. The lady went off saying that if Alexa is more than 30 feet away from the device it might not be able to control it. I guess she has never heard of strong wifi signals or repeaters. Then she claimed that the Prime account holder was my wife and the device was registered under my account, as if a Prime account is needed for this function. I tried telling her that it was irrelevant as long as the devices were ""discovered"" on the ""profile"" being used but she got mad because I wasn't buying her nonsense and hung up on me. The fact is that it has some bugs that need to be addressed.  The Hue app works all the time on both Apple and Android devices. I suspect there is a problem with the way Alexa tries to communicate with the Hue Bridge. It might be the same story with other devices but I don't know since I don't have other.","Positive"
"1013","Just received my 2nd Echo. I have had the 1st for over a year. I'm an audio geek and really did not buy the Echo for music. But the sound is exceptional for its size and now my wife and I use them in different rooms and the Echos are the only way we listen to music out loud. And speaking of loud, the Echo can fill up a good size great room with more than pleasant sound. Now with Amazon Music you can just start up a music station based on artist, song etc..., as well as request on demand music from millions of songs, all with your voice. We did have to adjust the wake word for the new one to Echo, the rooms are somewhat close, but I think it is just a testament to the quality of the built in microphones used by Amazon. Right out of the box it took just a quick setup with the Alexa App to connect the new Echo to my WiFi and now it too controls our lighting and such, adds things to our shopping lists, answers our questions, and plays beautiful music, just as well as the original. No learning needed...just saying. The Echo is by far the best deal in all of technological gadgetom. Love it, love it, love it times two!","Positive"
"1014","love love it. can't wait to give it to my husband for Christmas.  He is always telling me ...get on the internet and find ????.  now he can do it him self.","Positive"
"1015","Love having ECHO.","Positive"
"1016","This product is bigger than I thought which is not bad at all, love asking Alexa questions she's always on point. Would buy again....","Negative"
"1017","Interesting concept, but is disappointing for me. Using a Win7 64bit Pro system, have drivers problems. Setup would not complete train. Spent too many hours trying to program with little success. Finally had some TV action. Lost house power long enough that the Echo started over without TV. Echo keeps dropping internet. Win7 drivers are needed, but not easy to find. I do not have an Android. Had to restore PC. Few instructions are received with Echo. Assume I should have purchased an instruction manual for dummies. Very frustrated after second wasted day. Too bad I do not have a 12 yr old around.","Negative"
"1018","The family loves this device...... although it will not be able to answer a number of questions as it is of course tied to the Amazon system.","Positive"
"1019","AWESOME- we really enjoy Alexa.","Positive"
"1020","I reviewed this product app. a year ago and have decided to add a few more comments.  As a serious audiophile and in addition to spending big bucks on stereo equipment, I look for a sound that is pleasant to the ears.  I am pleased to say that the Echo is surprisingly good for the low cost.  I have compared it to both my Bose Wave system and my Bose mini speakers II. The only difference is less bass at the low end but overall the Echo has a nice balanced sound that is pleasant to listen to in my bedroom.  It will hold its own against these items that cost more.","Positive"
"1021","The app needs some work and you should be able to stream from your phone to Alexa via Bluetooth but the only way to do it is on the computer.","Positive"
"1022","Love it!","Positive"
"1023","Love it. Wife and I use everyday and Alexia is getting smarter each month. Also the sound is outstanding coming from this device, don't know how the make it seem like surround sound but they do.","Positive"
"1024","The echo is an item the that any older or ambulatory person can use with ease. Thank you for this device.","Positive"
"1025","Received item as described, thank you!","Positive"
"1026","What a neat device ... just installed it and added a smart receptacle to control lights just to test the product.  After some trial and error got the lights controlled along with music, jokes, stupid questions, how much wood could a ..., etc.  I'm sure many new things and functions will be added as time goes on.  Price changes on this device from time to time so keep watching and grab it when the price changes.  Have fun!","Positive"
"1027","Still learning everything I can do with the Echo but already love it.","Positive"
"1028","Item worked ok out of the box, but soon started to experience intermittent connection issues.  Every other wi-fi enabled device in my home had no issues, so it was not the network.  At first, a reset would remedy the issue.  Eventually, after a couple months, it would not connect to wi-fi at all, despite the app telling me it was connected.  Tried numerous troubleshooting methods, reinstalled app, setting up as if it were new, factory reset, etc.  Still just an orange ring and no activity.  So, put in for a refund/replacement and first e-mail gives me troubleshooting tips (that have all been previously attempted with no luck).  Second request for a replacement or refund gets me an e-mail that I have to call on the phone.  Unfortunately, working very long and odd hours I put the call in from work.  Despite telling the operator that I have tried every single thing that he suggests to me, he refuses to offer me a replacement or refund unless I am physically with the device and trying AGAIN the exact things I have tried before multiple times, but with him on the line.  I am tech savvy and not an idiot.  But Amazon seems to want to treat me like one if it gets them out of providing service.  I am a long time customer and have placed about 70 orders in the last 6 months as well as being a Prime subscriber.  But if this is how Amazon treats their loyal consumers, I think I will have to take my business elsewhere.  At this point, I may just throw the Echo against the nearest wall and wait for Google's device to arrive.  And really, even when the Echo worked, it really didn't offer much other than the weather and sports scores.  The light switch control can be done with a Wemo app without even needing it.  Sorely disappointed in this poorly constructed gimmick.  Even more disappointed that Amazon seems to want to spend more effort jerking me around than actually resolve my issue with their defective product.","Positive"
"1029","UPDATE:  Now the echo, after being unplugged for a couple weeks, refuses to power up at all.  So, contacted support again, and this time they issued me a return ticket.  So, I wouldn't say I'm recommending it, but it seems that if you just tell them that the device won't do anything, you can avoid the whole ""basic troubleshooting for idiots"" they try to put you through if you just tell them the device won't connect or other issues (other than the obligatory, ""did you try it at another outlet"").  Again, not saying this is the way to go to avoid that idiocy, but when the device won't power up, they seem to give up their efforts to make you feel like the defective product is your fault.","Negative"
"1030","The Echo and Bose are not audiophile quality, but portable, have blue tooth, and flexible. For a few bucks you can buy a great sounding  compact  Echo system  that will please most listeners. Pairing to separate speakers is easy, but I find the sound to be more than adequate for my enjoyment.","Positive"
"1031","Better than playing your CD's. just ask Alexa to play what you want.","Positive"
"1032","Gotta love Alexa!!!!","Positive"
"1033","it stopped working and it wasn't even a year old","Positive"
"1034","So it's been less than a week since my new Best Friend Alexa has moved into my apartment. I will say that having her around is pretty cool. LAZINESS ensues! ""Alexa: SHUT UP."" And she turns off the music. ""Alexa: does Florida play Georgia this weekend."" Alexa tells me the schedule. Alexa do I need a jacket? And so on...I will say, it's quite an adjustment because I've accidentally called Alexa ""Siri"" on more than one occasion. I wish she could play music from my cell phone or tell me when my phone is ringing so I can turn the music down but overall...so far...I like having her around to ""Play some yoga music"" at the end of a long day or ""wake me up in an hour after my nap.""  I'm not disappointed and neither will you. OH: (obviously) don't turn the volume up too loud or she won't hear you. Also, be sure to add feedback on whether she does what you want her to do or not because it allows her to adjust to you and your accent (if you have one). This is Veterans Day weekend 2016 so she played some patriotic music for me upon request. It was cool. I hope the Dot goes on sale for Black Friday because I need one in the bathroom, bedroom and spare office space. She's always listening too so when I'm on the phone talking about her to someone she ""wakes up."" It's hilarious. Lol.","Positive"
"1035","We love our Alexa!","Positive"
"1036","Absolutely love the Echo.  My family uses this all the time and the only issue we have is that our 10 year old keeps changing our music when we walk out of the room.","Negative"
"1037","it nice to just  alexa  anything and music sounds good","Positive"
"1038","Every time I use it, I am surprised to learn something else new that I can use it for.  Alexa seems to learn new tricks as fast as I do. Who knew it could tell me the temperature of my living room and adjusted 2 up. It turns on lights for me in rooms that I'm about to enter. And it wakes me and allows me a little snooze alarm and it puts me to sleep with gentle white noise music  or with the sound of spring peepers, those little frogs Whoshgpeeps g and","Positive"
"1039","Works flawlessly as research tool, for getting information on just about anything, for shopping,as a toy, and for entertainment.  Could  be greatly improved with the addition of some other useful applications such as, for example, one that would help one find things like phones, keys, etc. around one's home.","Positive"
"1040","Love Alexia and Echo.  Will probably buy for my kids, too.  (they're 35-40 so Santa is alive!)  LOL!","Positive"
"1041","I like it so far. I have added a Smart Wi-fi Honeywell thermostat and it works fine. I will be adding smart devices later on. Waiting on Sonos integration that's coming soon. Everyone loved that we can ask for a song or playlist to play.","Positive"
"1042","I can already imagine what can be integrated in the future to make it amazing.","Positive"
"1043","Great","Positive"
"1044","Love it","Positive"
"1045","My wife loves this. Alexa is awesome.","Positive"
"1046","Loved it so much I got a dot as well.  Basically has given me a smart home for next to no cost.  Works exceptionally well with Harmony Smart Hub.  So happy with this purchase!","Positive"
"1047","Love Alexa! Mainly use it for the weather and music.","Positive"
"1048","I honestly after a year or so have found so many uses for this device that i went out and purchased two Dots to compliment it. I use Echo to turn on and off lights, set timers, add to my shopping list and for just daily life that when i go away on travel i find myself wishing i could just say ""turn off the lights"" and ""set an alarm"" in my hotel room.","Positive"
"1049","That being said, there are some shortfalls. I appreciate that the 3 Echo systems can distinguish from each other and only the closest one will respond, but i do wish they would work in tandem as well. I know there are shortcuts around some of these issues, but a little more cooperation across all my Alexa platforms would be useful in ways I probably haven't even considered.","Positive"
"1050","Another serious problem, and one preventing my from purchasing other Amazon Alexa products, is the inability to use my various Echos to control my Fire TV Stick. I appreciate that the new versions come with an Alexa enabled remote, but i don't want to sit on my sofa in the same room as my Echo and have to use another device to access my Fire TV Stick. That to me seems like a serious design flaw. Why have 2 Alexa devices in the same room when, if they all access the same cloud, can't i just tell my Echo to play an Amazon Prime movie on my TV Stick?","Negative"
"1051","Love this!  Easy to connect to your Wi-Fi, nice looking, sound is great and no buttons or cd's to look for when you want music, just ask Alexa!","Positive"
"1052","Besides those gripes, which i hope are they are solving in light of the new Google Home, this is a fantastic device and a great speaker system to boot.","Positive"
"1053","I am unhappy with its voice recognition such as simple things like play certain music or find distance or answer to a general knowledge question. Its also gets disconnected from Wi-Fi lots of times and is uanble to answer - so you will have to reboot - ideally it should have done that automatically when it lost connection to Wi-Fi!!!! Gee should have bought possible two version later; after all the refinements.","Positive"
"1054","Alexa is amazing!  We have bought 4 and use her every day!  Quality is amazing!  Easy to control, and even added lighting control.  News, weather, traffic conditions, music and Amazon shopping through Alexa makes her a great addition!  Highly recommend, even if you don't use her to her fullest potential, for everyday music and news, well worth the money!","Positive"

"1058","I can why there are so many people that have purchased the Amazon Echo and why it has a 4 and half stars out of 5.  It's a really cool device to have.  In time I can see it dome and more things.","Positive"
"1059","Like it very much, but still having some problems getting the kinds of music, or the particular performers when asking for special songs or albums. Alexa seems to have trouble finding them in pandora or I heart radio.","Negative"
"1060","I got this as a birthday gift to myself best thing I bought so far I recommend this to everyone I love this product Amazon has come up with a great way to listen to music and other things just by voice command I say thank you to the one who created this as for the set up of the echo was very easy and very easy to handle all the features as well","Positive"
"1061","""alexa is dead, I smashed it with a hammer, and buried that shallow buried it in a shallow grave because that's all she deserved"" is going to be a really easy conversation with my kid and a terrible one to explain to my wife","Positive"
"1062","I am absolutely happy with my Echo!  It is a great device to learn current events, listen to music, become more educated and fun at family and friends gatherings.  Fantastic purchase!","Positive"
"1063","AMAZING. I wasn't sure how often I was going to use this, but it's incredible. I also have Hue lighting and Alexa works wonderfully with that. I am amazed how everything works seamlessly between the Alexa, Amazon, and Hue apps.","Positive"
"1064","I love my Amazon Echo. I use it all the time and also use it to freak out my friends. The only problem I have is that it MUST have an internet connection to work. If the internet is of, or out, it will not work to turn on lights or anything else that would only be on your LAN.","Positive"
"1065","Great product, I hope it will be a platform for more to come","Positive"
"1066","Expected more.  Purchased Alexa primarily for music, and didn't realize that you would have to pay for a relatively expensive monthly service through Amazon to stream music, or a different Amazon service to upload CD's I've already purchased through iTunes.  Alexa doesn't understand many of my requests, even for music I own and have uploaded to one of these services.  At this point, it's used only to shuffle music I own, or entertainment for our young kids who like to ask it questions, as anything more demanding is too much for its capabilities.","Positive"
"1067","This is the best thing to happen to a household. MUSIC. Always in all ways. My life is brightened, as is my children's.","Positive"
"1068","How did we function without the echo. I learned the hard way (make sure you turn off ordering from the echo) *if you have children. A drone through Amazon magically appeared on our doorstep due to young boys asking Alexa to ship a drone. :) I love all the music Alexa plays and being able to ask anything when it pops in my head. ""Does Chuck Norris know karate?"" ""What is the score of the __ basketball game"" ""What is the time/weather is also helpful with young children while scurrying through the house. We love it and some relatives will be receiving Alexa as a gift. I agree with other posters of having two if you have two stories. We rely on Alexa random info through the day and it would be helpful on the other floor. It sounds crazy and and indulgent but Alexa will soon feel like a family member.","Positive"
"1069","This is so much fun.I love the music you ask it to play.It will answer anything you need to find out at an amazing speed.I love it!!","Positive"

"1073","I love it. Wish it could tell me latest local news. As well as actual CNN broadcasting.","Positive"
"1074","I really have enjoyed using Echo. I haven't used it for anything other than music at this point, but plan to use it for other features.","Positive"
"1075","Terrific","Positive"

"1085","Love the echo and find it quite useful for those of us with failing memories.  Bought a second one as a gift for a dear friend.  Since it was a gift I paid the extra $3.99 to have it gift wrapped.  Big mistake a total was of $3.99.  Amazon's idea of gift wrapping is a colored box sealed with scotch tape.

"1088","She'said awesome!!!!","Positive"
"1089","Amazon Echo is a great device and I loved it and used often while it worked.  Then one day it decided it was not going to connect to my internet anymore.  I called echo support and after numerous trouble shooting ideas it was determined that the problem was my router!  Really?!  Between myself and my family and friends there has been almost 100 devices hooked up to my wifi and not a single one ever had trouble connecting.  My echo won't connect and it's my router's fault?!  They refuse to refund my money or send me a new one and I refuse to pay for one when the first one worked for a little over a year (just long enough to void the warranty).  It's a great device but not for $200/yr.  So good luck when you purchase one and hope that it never decides to stop connecting to your wifi, because once it does you will be the proud owner of a $180+tax paper weight.  Also shame on Amazon for not standing by their product.  I don't think it would bankrupt them if they had to replace their own faulty devices.  BUYER BEWARE!","Positive"
"1090","My wife was concerned when I brought a new woman into the house. We've both come to rely on her as a real help around the house. I haven't touched a light switch in months.","Positive"
"1091","I have had this Echo for one year and five months and it is now unresponsive, out of warranty, and will not reset. I also bought a tap, and a dot, both of which are still working.","Positive"
"1092","Update:  It turned out that the Echo was not the problem, it was the power supply. Amazon sent a new one out immediately and now the Echo works as it did before. Amazon credited my account with the cost of the new power adaptor.","Positive"
"1093","love it","Positive"
"1094","I don't think the speaker is all that amazing like the reviews say. It's good and does the job but I certainly wouldn't buy it just for its sound quality.  Quick and easy way to turn music on/off just to have some background noise while I'm getting ready or making dinner, but if I really want good sound quality for the pleasure of listening to music, I will turn on my home stereo. Otherwise doesn't do anything the Echo doesn't, but costs quite a bit more.","Positive"

"1098","Move over Siri... Alexa is the new girl in the house! Our family loves the features on this device and it was super simple to set up. I am just disappointed that we didn't get it sooner!","Positive"
"1099","Absolutely LOVED until it just died one day, less than two months after warranty ran out.  Will replace with Google Home, which works better with Google Play Music anyways. So disappointed.","Positive"
"1100","We love our Alexa and use it every day for music, shopping list and my 8 yr old used it to help look things up. In fact today she said, ""Alexa is part of the family."" Best purchase we have made on song time. I am getting my husband the for Christmas. The only improvement I would suggest is being able to change the name from Alexa. We really wanted to program it to answer to computer.","Positive"

"1106","I purchased the echo for my wife as a birthday gift. she loved it , but never used it my kids use it for homework, listening to music. My oldest was baking and Alexa read out a recipe, and in the end Alexa is useful, very cool . I purchased one and use it as a home automation platform with SmartThings. it works flawlessly","Positive"
"1107","Good but very limited in use with restrictions for information not able to go anywhere for information.  Sound is not that great even with EQ. settings for the money","Positive"
"1108","Happy with our decision to splurge early (before Christmas) for an Echo. Alexa (coupled with some other Amazon products & Amazon prime) has quickly become an asset in our household!!  Cooking assistance, jokes, and even the timer features were huge unknown perks to us.  :)","Negative"
"1109","Alexa, where have you been all my life? So far I've only had my Echo for a week, but I've picked up the bug and I'm already using it regularly every day. After the first couple of days, I went back online and order another Echo and a Dot, and plan to buy a few more dots soon.  Now I'm adding other smart products like Wemo Switches, Phillips Hue bulbs, etc., because once you discover the joy of Alexa, there's no going back to flicking the light switch by hand.  The only reason I didn't give it a full five stars is that I wish I didn't have to purchase an additional device (like Harmony hub) in order to control my TV and streaming channels using my voice.  It would be great to be able to just do it directly with the Echo, the way it controls music. I also wish I could tell Alexa to add multiple items to my shopping list and have them each listed separately without having to say Alexa before each item.  Those are the only two things I would like to see added, but it doesn't stop me LOVING this thing. When I first told my daughter I was getting one, before it arrived I asked if she was excited about it, but in typical teen fashion she said ""Ew...no."" However, once I set it up in my room and started playing my music, asking Alexa questions, setting my alarms, etc., she changed her tune quickly. I couldn't get a word in, because she took over giving Alexa instructions. Now she's calling dibs on the Dot that's on the way!","Positive"
"1110","We love our amazon echo, she is amazing.  She play Madonna for me & I danced after being in the intensive care for 16 days in a transplant hospital.  The echo plays any music you ask for.  She makes a list of your appointments, tells the weather forecast, keep your food buying list & many more skill apts.  I wish that I could buy one for everyone I know as Christmas gifts & I have a long list of family that shall receive This awesome device.  Thank you,","Positive"
"1111","Sincerely,","Positive"
"1112","Works well.  Wish it had more bass.","Positive"
"1113","Its a fad. If you have a spare phone you will get the same capabilities as this echo. Alexa can't answer a lot of the types of questions i ask, but it does decent job of playing music on demand. Sound quality is good for a small room, however i wish it had audio out. I have older HIFI system so it doesn't support the bluetooth audio from the Echo. ""Note: Echo feature: Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) support for audio streaming to Bluetooth speakers from Amazon Echo"" A little expensive for what you get. A better deal is the Echo Dot which does come with an audio out port.And it'll save over $100.","Positive"
"1114","Mr & Mrs Stephen Syputa  Thank you for having the echo & your prompt service.","Positive"
"1115","This is a product that I would definitely recommend the only thing I would change is the ability to move it from room to room without the cord.","Positive"
"1116","Echo is just a disaster and a frustrating exercise when it comes to controlling home devices. It suddenly couldn't find my devices anymore and then after more than an hour of troubleshooting and following a mile-long email of tech support instructions from Amazon, I just gave up. And, no, Amazon, I don't want to invest more of my time by taking up your invitation for phone support, unless of course you're willing to pay me for my time. All this is not worth it for 2 crummy light bulbs. And I don't think much of the rest of Alexa's skill set either","Positive"
"1117","Constantly losing connection","Negative"
"1118","A little snag getting set up, but once I got it up and running it sounds even better than I was expecting. This is going to be perfect as the only music player I have in my upstairs area. It fills up the room, and sounds good. Plus it has Alexa, which is growing on me by the day (I started with a Dot).","Positive"
"1119","The speaker is good, but other than that, this device is horrible. I have two echo dots that hear me perfectly but this doesn't hear me even when I'm standing next to it. It can't hear me over it's own alarm and if the volume is cracked up to 6 it can't hear me over itself playing music. This is a terrible design flaw and useless as an alarm. I'm so pissed that I spent so much on this.","Negative"
"1120","I bought the Amazon Echo in July when it ran on a special lightning deal.  I thought if I liked it I could purchase some for friends.  When I received it I sat it aside still in its box, and almost forgot about it.  I opened the box about a week ago.  It was very easy to set up and in a very few minutes I was listening to music.  I really do like it.  When my granddaughter saw and heard it she expressed a desire for one also.  I really hope Amazon puts them on sale for Christmas as I do plan on purchasing more.","Positive"
"1121","Don't really like it. It should've came with better instructions and it doesnt do do alot of things as far as asking questions. It doesn't have a lot of answers to everyday questions","Positive"
"1122","Easiest piece of technology I've ever bought and used...","Positive"
"1123","Just got it today and I'm already in love. It does so many things and I've only discovered a small fraction of what it's capable of. Extremely excited about this purchase!!","Positive"
"1124","So tired of fighting with costumer service to fix the problem with my echo not connecting to the internet,or connecting for a few hours than kicking me off,only to reset everything again,over this,we loved having it for music,but not worth having to reset it 2 times a day,sad thing is we have only had it 3 months.","Positive"
"1125","Everyone needs ""Alexa""! Lot's of fun.","Positive"
"1126","I am very disappointed to have to say this, but while I love the Echo--a very well designed piece of hardware which is very handy and plays radio and music very well--I am afraid that Alexa is really, really stupid. I keep having to pull out my laptop and ask OK Google even simple questions like movie times at theaters, or who my state representative is. My hope is that Amazon will make an effort to make Alexa more useful. Good for shopping and to-do lists and to play radio programs and music, but otherwise really pretty useless.","Positive"
"1127","A very powerful, friendly, and useful interface.","Positive"
"1128","Love it!","Positive"
"1129","This was a gift for my daughter.  She loves it.","Positive"
"1130","I love it","Positive"
"1131","We love Alexa!! We use it every day to find out the weather, news and start our day with a good song to get our son dancing. love it!","Positive"
"1132","This is great. Should have never hesitated on buying it... INCREDIBLE","Positive"
"1133","Love Alexa !","Positive"
"1134","I think she is fun !","Positive"
"1135","Crap, overprice. Wish I never wasted my time.","Negative"
"1136","I think she gets jealous over the little Echo !","Negative"
"1137","It works pretty good, I think once I read and take time with it I will have it good !","Positive"
"1138"," I love it because I watch my iPad a lot and I can't hear some of the movies or shows . Works great and when I'm on fb I'll tell her to play music .","Positive"
"1139","We have 2 of these now and I use them EVERY day. Once our power was out and I realized I couldn't ask Alexa, ""What time is it? ""Whats the weather?"" ""Alexa, play spotify"". Or ANY of those other things I ask on a regular basis while getting ready, cooking dinner, cleaning, or any other time where I want to be hands off my phone or computer. We have one in the bedroom and one in the kitchen/living room and they have become a regular part of our routine to listen to music, find out news, the weather, whatever it is. The sound quality is also very good, and to be honest we have stopped using our Bose speaker because the sound quality is comparable and it is simply more convenient. Bluetooth pairing is very easy too, but with integrated support for Pandora and Spotify we never really need to use it.","Positive"
"1140","Over all, would DEFINITELY recommend! You will not regret it!","Negative"
"1141","amazing I would recommend this to everyone.","Positive"
"1142","Have only had this for a week and we are still learning how to speak to it (her), but we are having a blast learning...daily weather, news briefs, election coverage, the occasional bad joke and the ability to keep up with our weekly grocery list...these are all within Alexa's scope of work...not to mention she can order an charge to my CC when i order on Domino's ..cool","Positive"
"1143","is a great addition to the home and activities it continue adding to our pleasure.","Positive"
"1144","Originally LOVED my Echo. I've had it for almost two years now. It worked perfectly all the time at the beginning. Over the past eight months or so, performance has significantly declined. It started to become intermittent what Alexa would hear and understand. Now it's to the point that I ask Alexa to turn the volume down and she asks me what device I am looking for. Sometimes I don't get any response at all.  It's pathetic and there's nothing I can do since Amazon only offers a one year warranty. For the cost of this device, Amazon should be offering a five year warranty. Disappointed and as much as I liked the device, I probably won't buy another to replace the one I have unless Amazon increases the length of its warranty (or decreases the price).","Positive"
"1145","Didn't read anywhere about not being able to use this in a Canadian iTunes Store. I've been trying to activate it for two days but nothing works. Not impressed.","Positive"
"1146","Great Product!","Positive"
"1147","Great speaker I would now wait to buy one to see if they make you pay for there music.. over and above your prime account","Negative"
"1148","Love this device.  I keep it in my kitchen and daily ask it to update me on the weather and the daily news headlines.  I also use it to play music from Amazon Prime music and to set timers as I cook.  Alexa can do lots of cool things like tell jokes when asked and sing ""Happy Bday.""  Love having Alexa as my personal assistant!","Positive"
"1149","This review is difficult to write because, on the whole, I enjoy having the Amazon Echo in our home; however, the fact that the Alexa app (that controls the Echo) is so poor dampens the whole experience.  The Echo itself is amazing!  My favorite features are being able to listen to music by command and the ability to keep a running shopping list the moment I think of something that I need to purchase.  HOWEVER, every time I go the store, the Alexa app won't allow me to pull up the shopping list!  How frustrating! If the Alexa app actually worked, and if the Echo had a few more skills, it would definitely be a five star rating for me!","Positive"
"1150","responds well, music is good enough, sets alarm. weather reporting could be a little more detailed and i am sure it has other uses i just did not figure out how to ask it just right","Positive"
"1151","Enjoy echo but needs to learn more info","Positive"
"1152","Purchased a refurbished Echo today and used free same day shipping.  I was super excited to get started using it, went to plug it in, and found the plug was way to large.  Called customer service, and they were happy to reimburse the funds to order another cord, but didn't seem to believe the cord didn't fit at first.  I finally looked up the model number for the power cord, and it it for a first generation Amazon Fire media streaming device.  I give this three stars at this point not due to any fault with the Echo itself, but because the refurbished unit was packaged with the wrong power cord, and it took 30 minutes to explain the problem and get the rep to believe me, and to add insult to injury, they wouldn't even upgrade my order to one day shipping.  I love Amazon, but am disappointed.","Positive"
"1153","Product is cheap and doesn't work as advertised","Negative"
"1154","We love this thing I looked at these since they came out and hemmed and hawed about buying one well I finally bit the bullet and bought one I liked it so much I was taking it from room to room So I bought a Echo Dot and that works just as good","Positive"
"1155","My 2nd Echo purchase this year is a  refurbished unit.  It appears to be brand new / never used.  Works the same as the brand- new one I purchased at the beginning of the year.  Easy setup, one unit in my primary residence, the 2nd unit in my vacation home.  Love them both!!!!!","Positive"
"1156","It feels like the future. Alexa does so much and has an amazing speaker. Alexa is an awesome assistant for when your hands are full or at buissy doing something else. She can control my nest thermostat and helps out a lot while doing homework. The speaker is so loud that it alone is enough to use during family parties and get-togethers.Alexa takes us one step closer to making our home a smart home of the future. Alexa is an AMAZING assistant.","Positive"
"1157","This thing is great.  We now own two...one for each of our properties.  This is a great time saving device and integrated seamlessly with our Insteon Smarthome System.  We really love Alexa!  She's funny too.","Positive"
"1158","Love it!","Positive"
"1159","This thing works pretty well but newer generations will only get better.","Positive"
"1160","shouldn't have to buy instructions on how to use product. should come with it","Negative"
"1161","Echo is fantastic. I use it everyday for music and news.i can't wait to get more things up and running.","Negative"
"1162","Got this for my Wink home automation system. Works fantastically and has many more features than I ever expected(not with the wink, just in general)","Positive"
"1163","Is fun","Positive"
"1164","I talk to her every day.  Kids get a kick out of her, Alexa.  Great to help kids with their homework.","Positive"
"1165","Never seems to work or have a clue what I'm asking, always need to reconnect it to my wify really not worth the $$ it's hype save your money","Positive"
"1166","I love Alexa! Very fun way to start home automation, planning, shopping, enjoying music and many more. I am happy and glad to have purchased one.","Positive"
"1167","I love my Echo. I am still trying to remember to use it. I have it play music, ask the time Nd play games with it. Living alone makes me feel not.... so ... alone.. but not in a freaky way .lol","Positive"
"1168","I love Alexa, great addition to the house.","Positive"
"1169","Best Amazon Purchase I've ever made! It's a fixture in my home. My boyfriend also purchased a Dot for the kitchen and set up Wink to make our home more automated. This product has become like my iPhone...it's hard to picture my life without it and I wonder how I've survived this long with out one!! Alexa is super helpful. Some examples....  Every night before bed, I have her set my wake up alarm, I ask her to cut off my bedroom light and make sure the doors are locked (her and Wink communicate), I also ask her for the news and weather while I get ready in the mornings, She also plays just about any song that I ask her to!! She is amazing!!","Positive"
"1170","well it doesn't do exactly what I thought it would do. I mainly wanted it for of course music, but it doesn't recognize some of the most popular songs I like, and IT DOES NOT DO TRAFFIC, there is no app, and was told that I would have to have a radio station app for that and I wanted it exclusively for that since I want to know where the delays are etc., so this is really of no use to me and I have to download other apps for recipes etc., just too time consuming, so it's going back until they can fix it....also I've had to yell at it in order for it to hear me....and then it didn't give me a wake up call, so I was glad I still use my phone and an extra alarm, to me it's just not worth it right now, until they actually get it completely right","Positive"
"1171","There is no way anyone reading this review will not think I am being compensated by Amazon for my review, but I will write it any way.  I think the Echo is worth its weight in gold and I am constantly amazed at how it performs. It is no doubt a technical giant step and I am not a novice to technology.  Even though I can't explain how it can hear me from a different room or recognize and answer almost any question, I would recommend it to anyone for too many reasons to go into.  I love the Echo and for that matter the shopping experience with Amazon has got to be the most pleasant way to purchase almost anything and know it is factory fresh because of the constant turnover. I spend what I think is a lot of money there.  Like I said, no one is going to think this is not a inside job review but I am just a long time satisfied customer of an extraordinary company who never ceases to amaze me.I don't think I am alone in my enthusiasm for Amazon.","Positive"
"1172","only down is that I thought I could get the same info I get on my computer with Google and it is very limited but good for weather, date, time, spelling etc. I found it complicated to set up on the app. i don't use the music or the house hold appliance components.","Negative"
"1173","Personally me and my family enjoyed this product, but we had to return it because we found out that our voice was being recorded and collected. Also it offered no offline support which should be able to do for its most basic functions.","Positive"
"1174","Setting this up has been an incredibly frustrating experience. For everyone raving about Alexa, let me tell you my problems.","Negative"
"1175","First, the Alexa app is one of the worst I've seen. It's buggy. Slow. Unresponsive. Crashes constantly. It is terrible (rated 1 star for a reason).","Negative"
"1176","Love it... Sometimes she doesn't listen to me, lol, and other times she thinks I am talking to her and nothing was said except the television in the background. Other than that I recommend owning one. I enjoy asking questions without having to look for my phone.","Positive"
"1177","After hours of trying to get Alexa to control the scenes on my hue lights, it finally kind of worked. A day later, no good. Nothing I said got her to control the lights.","Positive"
"1178","Called customer support. A nice kid tried to help me for 45 minutes but it basically consisted of him telling me it was strange that it wasn't working, and having him tell me to try the same commands in ten different ways. I flat out told him even if we got it to work (which we never did), I would never remember all these ridiculous hoops. Say scene before the scene name not after. Say ""for"" bedroom not ""in"" bedroom. Say it this way and that. Oy.","Positive"
"1179","Issue sent to engineering department. If they don't get back to me soon, this thing is getting returned.","Negative"
"1180","Other problems:","Negative"
"1181","Doesn't sync with iCloud calendar, A HUGE bummer.","Positive"
"1182","Speaker sounds muddier than I expected for music and audiobooks. Sometimes it's hard to understand.","Negative"
"1183","Almost every single skill I came across was rated 1-2 stars.","Positive"
"1184","Alexa Echo is a cool idea for an interesting product that when works was very impressive and delightful. Unfortunately, it's still so new and unreliable, and the overall experience is a time consuming frustration.","Positive"
"1185","We've been using Echo since Christmas and are generally pleased with it. I am not fond of some of the gimmicky skills and games you can play with the echo and generally use it for flash briefing and weather. Herein lies my problem with Alexa. You can't ask it a question that requires web surfing. In this day and age it would seem that this would be a primary design feature for something like this. I don't want it to shop for me. Answering a question or two now and then would be really nice.  The music connections and sound are awesome. Getting it to operate like Siri would be nice.","Positive"
"1186","This was a bit of an impulse buy, which is totally not me. But I am so happy I got it. I haven't had a real stereo in a while and now I use this in this way. The sound is not bad. I just ask it to play a genre (classical, American folk) and it comes up with a play list. Or you can set up your own or ask for a particular artist.. If you have Amazon Prime, you can order on it. We have fun asking ""Alexa"" to tell us jokes, and can give you info on movie theater times, the latest political polls, and more. My high schooler uses it for homework. You can ask it, ""Where was the Declaration of Independence signed? "" and it will give you an answer.","Positive"
"1187","great","Positive"
"1188","Awesome!!","Positive"
"1189","Love Alexa, it works beautifully","Positive"
"1190","Love..Love..Love..it!","Positive"
"1191","Just ordered my second Echo. This thing gets better every day!","Positive"
"1192","Plan to buy the dot to go with it! Love Love Alexa!!","Positive"
"1193","This is like the best speaker ever. <3<3<3","Positive"
"1194","I love love love my Echo! We haven't put it to for us yet because we are still learning but my husband and I love music and use it constantly for that!","Positive"
"1195","Good for music gets pretty loud","Positive"
"1196","Awesome little device. Performs super!!!!","Positive"
"1197","best thing i bought! love it! listen to my audio books,music, weather. kids use it for homework","Positive"
"1198","I haven't even had my echo for a year. It stopped working. I contacted Amazon and they basically told me that I have to keep calling back to resolve my issue. Apparently there is a different cord in which, they are all out of (for the past 2 months). Customer service is no help whatsoever. The product itself has potential but keep in mind, it stopped working for NO reason at all. Don't waste your money on a nonreliable, expensive product.","Negative"
"1199","Definitely love alexa.  Only gave 4 stars because it can sure use some improvements.  Such as more commands without enabling 3rd party skills.  Don't get me wrong some of the 3rd party skills are crazy good but some can be stock with the echo. I do love how you can order pizza or a Uber.  And also how you can add things to a shopping list and control music with your voice.","Positive"
"1200","Best product since my iPad!","Positive"
"1201","Works well for simple commands/questions, but there is still a while to go before Echo and Alexa are able to understand/interpret more complex commands.","Positive"
"1202","As a non-native English speaker, accents and grammar non-compliance is often an issue.","Negative"
"1203","Love it. The speaker is very good. I'm a very happy person.","Positive"
"1204","I like this product quite a bit, but am still not happy about the Prime Music to Amazon Music switcheroo they pulled.  Not cool, Amazon.  I had all my friends with Prime sold on getting an Echo or a couple Dots because of all the music available to Prime Members.","Positive"
"1205","But on the plus side, this may be the most fun life-interface you'll ever have.  I like waking up and asking Alexa about the temp outside and then asking her to shuffle a playlist for me while I'm getting ready for work.  She can hear me from any room in my condo.  If you've never said: ""Alexa, wikipedia Ionizing Radiation"" or asked her if she's self-aware, you're just not using your imagination.","Positive"
"1206","Disappointed.  I thought that it would be more helpful.  And it doesn't seem that they enhance its abilities.  Plays music, spells and does math.","Positive"
"1207","There is almost no limit to what this little device can do!  It occupies a small footprint on whatever surface you care to put it on and does not draw attention to itself.  The internal speaker sounds good and leaves me desiring nothing else but I am no audiophile.  The microphones are sensitive enough to hear you with a quiet word but can filter out amazing amounts of extraneous environmental noise even if you are speaking from across a rather large room.  It deals with echoes from nearby surfaces very well and has not missed a single command yet.","Positive"
"1208","As far as the little lady that lives inside that magical box goes: She gets better every day.  I feel like she knows how to do more than I know how to command her to do.  Alexa is quick with answers and never argues with me!  She is the perfect addition to a smart home or the perfect beginning to one.  Even if I don't know quite what to say, Alexa is patient with me and lets me get my sentences out but sometimes she keys in on the wrong word or phrase.  Sometimes she misses the wake word for unknown reasons that seem to have little to do with background noise.  She is a wonderful help to the hectic morning schedules and even the leisurely evenings.  I might even call her a part of the family.  Sure she isn't perfect but neither am I.","Positive"
"1209","Well let me start by saying that I actually do love the echo, however I bought it at the 179 price just to find out that less than 2 days later the price dropped to 140 and Amazon would not help me out by fixing the price match.Not cool.........","Positive"
"1210","Greatest things since sliced bread.  I'm afraid that the Age of the Machine is upon us.","Negative"
"1211","Love it","Positive"
"1212","I can't get it to pair with my phone. A little disappointed","Negative"
"1213","Very useful and nifty!","Positive"
"1214","Just love my Echo!!!","Positive"
"1215","I love Alexa!!  She does so much for me.  She reads my son and I bedtime stories, plays music, reminds me when things are due, wakes me up in the morning, reminds me when to take food out of the oven, and so much more.  This was the best investment ever!","Positive"
"1216","I LOVED THE ITEM BUT I SHOULD BE CHARGED $149.00","Positive"
"1217","I've had an echo dot for a few months now and really enjoy it, I love Alexa's ability to actually integrate with other apps like Spotify ""Alexa, play Nickleback on Spotify"" where all their competitors can basically open the app for you and that's it.","Positive"
"1218","Great purchase !!!! Fun, fun !!!","Positive"
"1219","Just love this thing. Alexa will replace your so... many things. Speaker, Apps, Home Automation, Programming Toy, AWS services toolkit and much more. My kid, the 15-month baby, loves when Alexa talks out loud and plays songs. He is more fascinated recently when Alexa is doing the lights on/off thing for us in the living room. In fact, it was little darker yesterday, and he started to talk to Alexa, maybe he wanted the lights on? I'm super happy with the purchase, and I intend to buy echo dots during the Thanksgiving season. Cheers!","Positive"
"1220","I love it.","Positive"
"1221","Our family does love our Echo/Alexa however the fact that they DROPPED the price so drastically is unfair -- I feel they really took advantage of their first customers...........and it makes me doubtful in supporting them ever again","Positive"
"1222","I absolutely love it, I have since gotten a second one for a friend. She loves it too. I don't get those folks with ""issues"" with theirs, seems like the whole story isn't being shared. I use it at home and on travel with not a single problem.","Positive"
"1223","This is a great addition for anyone who can use some voice activated help around the house.  Easy to set up and a great tool to have","Positive"
"1224","I mostly like it, but I feel like its picking it on random conversations we have in my kitchen. Sometimes it lights up when we are talking and nobody says Alexa at all! Short of that sounds decent and has some good functions if you are willing to learn the commands.","Positive"
"1225","One of the best investment i made recently. Kids enjoy the new gadget at home.","Positive"
"1226","OMG!!!!! WE LOVE ALEXA! It's configured to work with our home, actually making it the epicenter and brains of our ""smart house"". She controls the lights, the security and door locking mechanisms, does out grocery shopping, gives us the morning news,","Positive"
"1227","Game changer in the kitchen.  So happy with Alexa!","Positive"
"1228","I can't forget anything now.  I use Echo everyday for timers and my shopping lists. It improved my life in many ways.","Positive"
"1229","I was given an Amazon Echo for Christmas and I use it all of the time. I like it so much, I bought one as a birthday present for a relative. The voice response is flawless. I can practically whisper and the Echo will pick up my command. My family is also obsessed with ""Alexa""! The reason that I rated the Echo at a 4 instead of a 5 is that it takes a bit to set it up. Also, the advertised actions of turning on the lights or even the sprinklers is not that easy. If these things become more readily accessible then I will absolutely give the Echo a full five stars. In terms of volume, the Echo's speaker is great. I placed my device on my refrigerator. Being in an open area allows the 360 degree output to fill all of the adjacent rooms. The audio is also very clear. The height is comparable to that of a paper towel roll (I figure this is an item everyone is familiar with), but a bit less round (in diameter) than a new paper towel roll. Odd analogy, I know, but at least you can put a paper towel roll in a spot and see if the Echo will fit in around the house. The Echo also has a power cord, which isn't made exactly obvious, so keep that in mind. The placement of the Echo is recommended to be away from walls as well, so finding a corresponding outlet may be a bit difficult. The cable is about 5 feet by my eye's judgement. The plug in is not conventional, as it is a rectangular prism and sticks out a bit. The benefit of the plug in is the fact that the cord won't be bent by anything placed in front of an outlet. The plug in also allows enough room to use the upper outlet for a conventional US outlet. Overall, the Echo is a really nice product for a household that often plays music aloud, for those who try to be hands free with their technology, and those willing to upgrade the rest of their electronics to be compatible with the Echo's voice command features.","Positive"
"1230","It was great for a year and now she won't do anything.  I have reset it and tried everything but all she will do is listen for about 3 seconds and then shuts down well before you are done asking her something.  And there seems to be no support for this.  How do you email 'Amazon'....?????","Positive"
"1231","There is nothing to do for support for this.","Positive"
"1232","Very disappointing.","Negative"
"1233","Outstanding. Being older I was skeptical when my son ordered this for me. I am thrilled with my Echo. I ask her to play music, tell me about the weather and play games. My dog like listening to her and wags his tail when she answers a question. Set up was easy and straight forward. I am very happy.","Positive"
"1234","I like the Echo, it is certainly a step in the right direction.  However, there are a few things that I hate about it.  For example, being forced to call the device Alexa is somewhat annoying.  It is a personal assistant I paid for, I want to be able to call it what I want.  2nd gripe is that we cannot change the voice.  3rd gripe is that there is no 3.5 mm audio input/output jack.","Positive"
"1235","I still like the Echo however if they had these changes it would be absolutely PERFECT!!!","Positive"
"1236","Hello everyone I would like to write a review about my experience with the Amazon Echo I am very tech savvy and keep up with everything that comes to the market and I have  say I was very skeptical of this product at first but that all changed when I received the product because the Amazon Echo is absolutely phenomenal and I strongly encourage anyone who is wondering if it is worth the price to purchase this product because you will not be disappointed I can guarantee it I have had the Amazon Echo for a while now and use it absolutely every single day you might be wondering what I like about the Amazon Echo the most and that is the voice recognition that it has normally if you would like to listen to Pandora or set an alarm you would have to do it from your phone and sometimes that can be a pain but with the Amazon Echo that is all over because all you have to say is Alexa play Pandora and she will go to the last Pandora station you listened to or you can say Alexa play smooth jazz on Pandora and she will go to your smooth jazz station on Pandora and setting an alarm is a breeze with the echo just say Alexa set an alarm for 6 a.m. and that's it no more having to go through your phone to set your alarm anymore. And that is my review of the Amazon Echo","Positive"
"1237","Simply put I love my Alexa.","Positive"
"1238","Love this...one or the cooler more useful products to come along.","Positive"
"1239","Love this Very cool!!","Positive"
"1240","We absolutely LOVE our Alexa! Alexa has made such a difference in our home...she keeps tract of my calendar, helps the kids with homework,keeps up with my shopping list, adjusts our AC thermostat, plays music, and so, so much more. The app is great too! I can turn Alexa on remotely with the app and when I'm at the grocery store I can pull up the app to see what's on my list.","Positive"
"1241","It's not only great but fun to use.  When I wake up I just ask her what the weather is, what's in the news, or play me some music. Met more than my expectations.","Positive"
"1242","Decent speaker, nothing else really works. I have to unplug it and plug it back in every six hours for it to understand anything from my voice or the Alexa app.","Positive"
"1243","I absolutely LOVE this.. I can listen to my favorite music .. get the weather..  Alexa will tell me a joke when prompted..  And I can order Amazon products thru Echo....","Positive"
"1244","I WANT A CREDIT FOR 40.00 SINCE YOU REDUCED THE PRICE SINCE FRIDAY LARRY SAYAH","Positive"
"1245","Great product. It does what it is advertised to do. If you listen to a lot of music, this device is for you.","Positive"
"1246","It works great as expected.  My family is enjoying it. Its helping me turn my home into an smart home.","Positive"
"1247","So far so good!  Constant additions and improvements. Can't wait for more.","Positive"
"1248","I love it. There is so much that can be done, not just music and weather. You can have it operate the lights, TV ( with proper equipment) and even tell you a joke. There are a few glitches here and there but it's a device that is always learning.","Positive"
"1249","great","Positive"
"1250","The device was dead on arrival, plugged it on and nothing happens, no blue ring,or whatever. Just a light burning smell. Great for spending $179.99 to trash can.","Negative"
"1251","Love Alexa.  I own several Dots and 2 Echos.  We love of them.  My biggest complaint is Amazon punishes early adopters.  I just bought a second Echo two weeks ago and this weekend the price dropped $40.  The original 2 Dots I bought were double the price I paid last month for 3 more.  I'm not feeling the love here Amazon.","Positive"
"1252","I love Alexa awesome","Positive"
"1253","We absolutely love it! :)","Positive"
"1254","I love this product, but it fails at what I really wanted to do with it--create a house-wide entertainment system.  I wish I could sync it with other Bluetooth speakers around the house so I could have a song playing in multiple rooms around the house (and outdoors).  I'm looking forward to all the additional skills that are constantly being added, although mostly it's just used for music and simple question tasks.","Positive"
"1255","My favorite thing in my house","Positive"
"1256","I may just return this  it worked great the first week and a half. Nown I tell it to play music or find my phone and it tells me it's doing it but doesn't very do anything. It's turned into a regular Bluetooth speaker more than anything. I'm lso upset that I finally caved and bought the thing and 2 weeks later it's on sale for $40 cheaper, another reason to return it aND just buy a whole new one. I'm super disappointed.","Positive"
"1257","I use this as my bedroom alarm clock/radio.  It is very easy to use and can pickup your voice even with music playing.  The biggest issue is that each command is separate and you cannot combine them.  Basically, you need to speak like a machine for the machine to understand.  For example, ""Alexa...(wait)....play music.""  ""Alexa....(wait)...turn down volume""  ""Alexa...(wait)..change station""  The command section should stay on for another 5-10 seconds to see if another one is issued.  Similar issue when getting your daily feed/news.  This would make the device much more user friendly and intuitive.","Negative"
"1258","Sound quality is better than a small desktop radio but definitely not high quality.  I previously was using a small desktop bose system and Echo doesn't stand up to that quality of sound.  The sound quality is clear enough but not crisp in any of the low/mid/high ranges.  It would be nice if there was a clock on the device or the ability to wave your hand over it and have it do a default action (tell the time, start the radio, etc)  but I understand that they are going for a minimalist look.  The volume ring adjustment at the top is a great feature.","Positive"
"1259","Currently, it is clear that this is a young system with lots of undeveloped potential.  Undeveloped being the key word.","Positive"
"1260","We are best friends! Love Alexa.","Positive"
"1261","Perfect for help living with my disabilities. I can set my own calendar, alarms, etc","Positive"
"1262","I'm upset.  One day after I received my Echo, you run a special.......drop the price of it.","Negative"
"1263","Love it!","Positive"
"1264","Hands down the best item I've ever bought through amazon. Yes it's changed my life. It has become a family tradition to sit down for dinner and have Alexa give us the news or randomly dance to music for fun. Setting timers for cooking and even finding my phone if it's lost. I've brought her across the country when we moved and our home felt complete when we plugged her in and she said ""Hello""  You won't regret this purchase.","Negative"
"1265","Still learning how to use the Echo but love being able to stream my music and ask questions","Positive"
"1266","This is the future of home innovations....this really has made my life easier....thank you Amazon for a great invention!","Positive"
"1267","Not worth the money sound is OK at low volume but will not pickup Voice commands. Specific song requests will not be allowed unless you purchase additional amazon services. That being said it is a really good Alarm clock as long as you have an Internet connection. If not then it will not work at all..... and tends to loose Internet connection constantly","Positive"
"1268","Worked GREAT for 5 months then the power supply went bad.  I have a second Echo so I know it was the power supply and not the unit itself.","Positive"
"1269","I just ordered a replacement power supply and also a spare in case this happens again.  When the replacement arrives I'll make sure and plug it into a surge protector and would recommend others to do the same.  With the cost of the unit, I really think it should have lasted a lot longer than 5 months.","Positive"
"1270","still learning the advantages of the device","Positive"
"1271","Awesome product and home edition, As this is my first exposure to the Amazon Echo as a consumer, I am greatly impressed by the functionality and the features this Echo can bring to the home, Especially with IoE integration. I'm bummed i haven't purchased this product sooner, but better late than never!","Positive"
"1272","Very cool finally someone who will listen to what I say","Positive"
"1273","Love the Echo, great for my bedroom or any room at that, use it to listen to music.","Positive"
"1274","The Echo is working just as described. I'm surprised at how well it interprets my requests. So far I  use it as an interactive music device, almanac, news -person and weatherman. I was concerned that the requests needed to be precisely worded but I have discovered that it permits much more flexibility than I would have guessed. I would purchase it again knowing what  I now know.","Positive"
"1275","I give up. The product never worked right and no matter how many times I tried to contact Amazon I could not get any help.","Positive"
"1276","Wonderful, don't know what I would do without it","Positive"
"1277","This was a gift for my husband. He is a tech guy & really likes this speaker. We us it mostly for playing music but I really like the grocery list feature.","Positive"
"1278","Very impressed! Received this as a gift and we are defiently satisfied. There is nothing this can't do. The music quality is excellent. We had a guest over and they thought it was surround sound throughout the house! We are now considering the dot for other rooms in the house!","Positive"
"1279","Great device -- would be nice if it could access common general knowledge information like zip codes or area codes type","Positive"
"1280","This is the best thing since ""sliced bread""!!!, I have 5 of them now (the including the ""dots"")","Positive"
"1281","I love my ECHO but the calendar integration really needs to get figured out without having to use a skill.  Very frustrating to not be able to link ALL my calendars to keep me on schedule.","Positive"
"1282","Other than that it is a super cool device and can't wait to see what else it can do in the future.","Positive"
"1283","There is no ""I"" in the Echo's AI. This keyword based Amazon shopping engine has a looooonnnggg way to go. Great for spitting out weather and news; great for setting alarms and cooking timers. Used to great for playing music, until Amazon decided Jeff Bezos isn't rich enough and decided to try a squeeze monthly fees out of Prime members. Not so great at listening for commands if the volume is above 4, and it seems to be getting worse. Yes, I will be buying Googles Home to see how they compare, I am not a ""captive customer"" and will switch eco-systems if another serves me better.","Positive"
"1284","Great sound, with tons of skills.  It works great as a music player/audiobook reader with its ability to connect to services like Audible, Prime Music or Bluetooth audio devices but the fun doesn't stop there.  Since I received my echo, it has become the control for my Hue lights (purchased because of Echo integration), a morning news source and a daily Jeopardy dose with  ""Jeopardy J6"". And it has a surprising range: I can be heard from almost any place in my apartment.","Positive"
"1285","  Numerous friends have purchased their own after using mine and everyone enjoys testing her out when visiting, I know of no one who has been unhappy with an Echo","Negative"
"1286","Keeps me company in the kitchen. My best companion yet!","Positive"
"1287","great product","Positive"
"1288","I would gladly give this product 5 stars BUT, you can't make or receive phone calls from the Echo.  All I want is to be able to say ""Alexa Answer the Phone"" and then have her act as a bluetooth speaker.  It's sooo simple and sooo frustrating that we can't do this yet.","Positive"
"1289","i think its a neat gadget.  we bought it on a whim when it first came out and intended to use it as a speaker for music.  it works well for that purpose, but definitely is not the best speaker out there.  i like to use it to tell time or weather or simple stuff, but it usually doesn't have answers to most of our questions.  it does have cool capabilities though per the biweekly ""what can alexa do"" emails...but you need to ""add"" the function via the app or have compatible devices","Positive"
"1290","I love my Echo.","Positive"
"1291","Alexa can be finicky at times--be careful how you phrase questions to her, but overall, she is super fun at parties, especially when you link with amazon music, or Pandora/Iheartradio!!","Positive"
"1292","thank you tony","Positive"
"1293","Awesome!!!","Positive"
"1294","Works like a charm how did we live without it?","Positive"
"1295","I really like the echo. I just wish that it would work with the amazon calendar.","Positive"
"1296","I love my echo! I enjoy being able to listen to a variety of music, my regular radio stations etc.It has great sound quality that I can hear throughout my house. It is easy to use, easy to set up and fun! My son loves that Alexa has a ""dinosaur"" music playlist just for him. I use the alarm feature on the echo every singe day to remind me to do things, or just as a timer for baking. I like that the echo can keep me updated on the news as well. I use my echo everyday and enjoy using it. I'm still figuring out everything Alexa can do. I'd recommend the echo to anyone!","Positive"
"1297","I do love my Echo. Didn't think I really needed one when I first heard about them but sure glad I did go ahead and order one","Positive"
"1298","Works great but needs software improvements. Asking Alexa a question can be like learning another language. You have to ask Alexa to ask a third part your question. Not a very direct and user friendly way to interact. I have to keep a cheat sheet with the phrases needed to activate a skill because the wording is unusual difficult to remember.","Positive"
"1299","Easy, simple and fun to use. Setup was easy to link to home. Echo is a happy addition becoming part of the family.","Positive"
"1300","Love it","Positive"
"1301","Great product","Positive"
"1302","I miss my Echo when I'm not at home, and I seriously don't understand why everyone doesn't have one in their home!! I wish it would have either a way to directly plug in a iPod or bluetooth music from a device that isn't via Amazon. Also, would love for it to pair with other speakers in the house. It is worth the money just for the ability to call out commands for shopping lists, mathematical questions, trivia, etc, but is mostly used for streaming music. In my home, I want to hear the music in more rooms.","Positive"
"1303","I love it !!!!!!","Positive"
"1304","Works great!","Positive"
"1305","great appliance and speaker.. but setting up could be better. the android application is terrible, it lags really bad. you press the setup button in alex app in android and it responded 5 seconds later.  very disappointing for a $180 product to have a poor app. and this appliance requires the application for it to work initially.","Negative"
"1306","limited functionality.","Negative"
"1307","Love this product!!!  Recommend it to all!","Positive"
"1308","only last for one year before it stops working. amazon sent me a replacement back in June. october the replacement also stop working.","Positive"
"1309","piece  of junk. A big waste of money.","Negative"
"1310","Cool.  I found some software that allowed be to hook to Vera home automation hub.  Amazing on it's own and getting better for home automation.","Positive"
"1311","The Echo/Alexa speaker is great.  I like it because I don't want to raise my voice to ask Alexa a question or command.  I speak at a low voice or even a slight whisper and it picks it up and does what I ask.  I like the ability to add more ""Skills"" to the device and give it more ability to respond.","Positive"
"1312","I could not connect to the internet/wi-fi.  The phone app was not helpful at all.  I returned the Echo.","Positive"
"1313","In love with Alexa.","Positive"
"1314","Love it","Positive"
"1315","Great sound and love how I can control home automations through Alexa.","Positive"
"1316","Wish the Echo did more, like find my phone.  but i love it","Positive"
"1317","Greatest invention of the decade!!!","Positive"
"1318","Alexa is now a part of our family:)","Positive"
"1319","Great little  gadget, my wife uses it all of the time for news updates and music.","Positive"
"1320","Amazing!","Positive"
"1321","Great!!!","Positive"
"1322","I am learning about it, and really enjoy it so far. I recently purchased the dot, for the man cave.","Negative"
"1323","Love, love, love my Echo and Echo Dots I got for other rooms.  So efficient and fun!","Positive"
"1324","The speaker on the Echo, compared to the Dot, or my Beats Pill, is so rich and full of bass, even on the kitchen counter, I love it!","Positive"
"1325","This is so great, I bought two echoes and six little dots.  Great sound on the big echo.  Soothing voice.  Usually has the answers for most questions.  I have been afraid to order from it.  I like to compare prices.  One can only imagine if you had smart devices how convenient this would be","Positive"
"1326","Update 12/1  Still a fan EXCEPT if you order from Alexa besides making sure your one click order settings are what you want, I discovered that the prices that she gives you on ""Alexa what are your deals"" are not accurate.  I got bit, twice.  If you have any kind of credit, Alexa gives you the price without telling you that she has applied a credit.  For instance the dishwasher tablets that I ordered were not the $4.69 price, they were actually closer to $11 making costco cheaper.  Had she told me that the cost was $11 but that I had a $6 credit that could be applied making the FINAL COST $5 I might have made a different decision.  This is a major flaw for me because I want to know the cost before any of MY credits. This is particularly important when Amazon has told you that you have a $10 gift card coming in a week, and you order a couple of days later never having been told that your ""gift card"" has already been posted invisibly to your account.  Bottom line, don't tell me that the cost is $0, tell me what you are charging everyone else and then let me know if I can use any of my personal credits.  I suppose I could have deciphered all of that by getting on my computer but then again Alexa has been touted as a convenient easy way of ordering and if within 30 minutes of ordering I have to see that the price she said is the price they charged then what is the point.","Positive"
"1327","Still getting use to her, but everything my wife wanted and that's a plus to me.<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008E>","Positive"
"1328","Fun","Positive"
"1329","Love it, love it, love it!!!","Positive"
"1330","just a waste. anyone who can actually do anything with this other than a $179 alarm clock / timer is simply lying. if it used google for a search engine this would be unstoppable.as it is it simply sucks. sure you can ask it what time it is in Russia. seriously? it can do/answer absolutely nothing.","Negative"
"1331","While I love Alexa, the app leaves so much to be desired. It is almost impossible to open most places I go because of little or no internet connection. There has to be some improvement you can make to help this issue. Please try to improve the app so it opens quickly.","Positive"
"1332","Pros : None !","Positive"
"1333","Cons : Alexa Plays Samples Of Songs That She Has Played The Full Version Of Before.Sometimes She Says That She Cant Find Previously Played Song.. When I Ask Her To Play A Song The Speaker Lights Up,But She Doesn't Respon .She Doesn't Stop The Music When I Ask Her To. She Acts Unintelligent All The Time !","Negative"
"1334","I Don't Recommend This.","Positive"
"1335","The echo died after three months and amazon refuses to replace it.","Negative"
"1336","The family and I are enjoying the Echo product!","Positive"
"1337","The device has great sound - no problems there, and speech recognition works.  Here's my issue:  ALEXA is wholeheartedly a Liberal Democrat that chooses only the ani-Republican news to report, maybe that's a product of CNN's pro-Hillary election lean.  I've gotten tired of all the one-sided election news that I've just unplugged her until the election is over.  ALEXA is not as useful as I thought it would be in daily life, shopping lists is about all we use her for anymore.  Unless things change with the liberal bias of ALEXA we will be selling her at a yard sale soon.","Positive"
"1338","Cold and underneath the covers? I yell at this device to set the alarm or play my music. Multi-tasking while cooking? I again yell at this device. Too lazy to look up the weather? Ask big sky. It's so handy.","Negative"
"1339","Good product but lacks quality as a speaker for music. The Echo does not provide support for an external speaker which I was disappointed with. I would love this product together with a Sonos speaker.","Positive"
"1340","Echo is the bestest!!! Great product.","Positive"
"1341","A lot of fun for the grandkids.","Positive"
"1342","Very pleased with our purchase...she's good company and you can depend on Alexa","Positive"
"1343","to listen to you and do your bidding.  Thanks Amazon...well worth our expenditure..CP","Positive"
"1344","I am in love with this thing, I just wish i would play Soundcloud.","Positive"
"1345","Fun!","Positive"
"1346","I love it, but it is now dead after 8 months.  Not sure I will buy another.","Negative"
"1347","I am at a loss as to why Amazon would continue to allow such a horrible app like the Alexa iPhone app to continue.  While the Echo is great for telling me the time and weather.  It is always confused how to turn on and off Hue lights.  I got them all in and working one day, and the next day Alexa had forgotten how to turn the Hue lights on and off.  The Alexa app appears to have been developed by someone in 1995.","Positive"
"1348","Love it!  The only thing I don't like is having to reestablish the connection with Echo after my internet connection has broken and has been fixed.","Positive"
"1349","The other thing it seems is that the treble/base settings seem to reset themselves -- I always have treble set to high and bass set to low so that I can better understand what Alexa is saying.","Positive"
"1350","A friend I didn't know I missed! Love the Echo!","Positive"
"1351","useless, a waste of money!!!","Negative"
"1352","My wife said she wanted one of these. Our anniversary was just a couple days away and I hadn't a clue what to get her, so problem solved. setup was simple. works very well. My wife loves the shopping list feature. we have a ""Smart shopper"" that you can add things to the grocery list and print off when its time to go to the store. however she tends to either forget to take the list with her or cant find it once she gets there.The Echo list can be viewed on her smart phone anywhere she goes so this is perfect. saves me from having to text her the list when she cannot find it. also allows things to be added from the app. the only thing I can see as an improvement is having the ability to have more than one list. But like all products, there is always room for improvement. even if they are small. all in all its a nifty gadget that actually has a useful purpose. we use it frequently. My 9 yr old son is always asking it questions.","Positive"
"1353","does not know much  and does not learn like was advertised","Positive"
"1354","I love it but I wish I could access more things like restaurants that deliver near me, not just domino's because that's gross. Also I would love if alexa knew my voice distinctly from others, just a thought to personalize the experience.  Besides that she's pretty awesome.","Positive"
"1355","This thing is truly amazing! I had Pre-Ordered one when they were introduced for my Mother. I had put the app on my phone when I hooked it to their WiFi. Next day at work my phone kept vibrating over and over. Well, I saw everything she asked Alexa to do. What songs she requested, shopping list etc...I know she uses it a lot! I've removed the app and now bought her another one for her bedroom to control the Samsung Lights with. Very well worth it!","Positive"
"1356","Awesome for the discounted price!","Positive"
"1357","Played with a friends echo two months ago seemed to work without any glitches. So I order the echo and dot and the name should be changed to glitch Alexa can not seem to process basic questions. Both are on there way back. Google Home on its way. <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00B3>","Negative"
"1358","Excellent !!!!!","Positive"
"1359","Nice for hands free use on things.","Positive"
"1360","There are occasionally a few glitches, but Alexa and I are learning together.  I got this for a birthday present and at first I thought it was a bit indulgent, but now I am in love with the Echo.  I use this in my art studio when I'm working. It is definitely great to have voice commands when my hands are messy.  I have been exploring new music on Amazon Prime playlists and can always listen to my own music by pairing my phone with the Echo. I can tell her to pause, change a station, ask a question, all with my hands full.  Very convenient. I know it is all programmed, but it is definitely fun and useful.  I always say ""good morning"" and ""Good night"" to Alexa and she'll treat me to a fun factoid or wish me sweet dreams. And she tells ""punny"" jokes.  Having a blast.","Positive"
"1361","I love it.  Can't believe the sound when the music plays.  Just as good as any Bose system.  I also like that I can ask Alexa anything and she responds right away and always has the correct answer.  It is just amazing.","Positive"
"1362","I love you Amazon! The Echo may be the best thing invented since the internet","Positive"
"1363","Only good for playing music and audible. I have had mine for a few months and almost all of the skills I have installed have started messing up and not work. Very disappointed with this purchase.","Positive"
"1364","I own two Echos, and have given two as gifts over this past year. Everyone loves their Echo!","Positive"
"1365","love it is the best product I have","Positive"
"1366","Obsessed with my Echo, and love how it enables me to multi task while doing things around the house.","Positive"
"1367","Great addition to our living room.","Positive"
"1368","Love it!!","Positive"
"1369","love it","Positive"
"1370","Well lets just say I really only use her to play music. Ever time I ask her something she says ""I do not have an answer for that."" Really frustrating being a huge reason for her purchase was help the kids with homework questions.","Positive"
"1371","Works great.","Positive"
"1372","I got a Echo and I really love it. I got it because it can read my Kindle books but when going into the list of Kindle books it drives me CRAZY CRAZY CRAZY did I say CRAZY cause that's what I meant, that there is no search bar so I have to scroll like a mad person to find the book that Alexia was reading.  Does anyway know if there is a better way or another option?","Positive"
"1373","Just love her.. so much to learn and do with her... and as you see in the video she pairs great with the  Philips Hue LED Starter Kit","Positive"
"1374","I'm a tech junkie, and this thing is a major tech ""fix""  They have done an excellent job with the speech recognition side of it, and the search engine that they use to get the answer to your request is almost perfect.  I go t this for my wife as a birthday present, and she loves it.  I think her favorite thing is being able to add things to the shopping list during the week, and just pulling up the app at the store, and everything is right there on the phone.","Positive"
"1375","I am so happy with ""Alexa"". She answers all my questions and her sound quality for music is awesome! I would recommend the refurbished for sure.","Positive"
"1376","I primarily use it for music, but its so at the ready and convenient and it offers good recommendations for that.","Positive"
"1377","I am a volunteer for disaster services and like to listen to my local Police, Fire, and EMS scanner when I'm on duty. Alexa says ""Not available at this time"" when I ask her to play any scanner station via Tunein. I can Bluetooth from my phone, but doing that disrupts the wireless router signal throughout my home. Maddening.","Positive"
"1378","If I could recommend feature enhancements:","Positive"
"1379","Add snooze to the alarm","Negative"
"1380","Voice command for the alarm to snooze","Negative"
"1381","Play music for the alarm instead of the noise","Negative"
"1382","Voice command google searches short response information such as ""Who won Best Actor at the Oscars in 2015?"", or What's the lead singer's name for such and such a band?""","Positive"
"1383","I really thought I was taking a chance with the Echo. My expectations were middle of the road but I will say without question I love it. This is the one gadget I use every single day. The voice recognition is flawless. It has integrated with every peripheral I have added seamlessly. The amount of times I use it just as a timer when I am cooking is perfect. If I had one complaint it is pretty useless to look up anything for information purposes. It is definitely not Google. The one thing I find surprising is the way it seems to add more and more ""skills"" each day.","Positive"
"1384","I don't get it... I have literally never used this dumb thing!  It gets everything wrong that I say, so I just unplugged it!  Your smartphone can do everything this can do and it is in your pocket!  Don't waste your money!","Negative"
"1385","Does not work in India. It does not say on the site or anywhere else that it's only works in US. Wasted my money","Positive"
"1386","It's a piece of junk wish I never got it works fine for 3 months than it starts messing up I call for answers can't understand the person on the phone I don't think they even know what to do","Positive"
"1387","We bought this as a gift to ourselves. It is the coolest device we own and it's transformed our daily lives. We have small children and I always wanted them to grow up with an appreciation of different types of music. The Echo makes it possible for us to play anything we want at any given moment. When the baby is growing impatient while we're cleaning up after dinner, we throw on some Beach Boys. When our five-year-old wants to be silly, we play Monster Mash. When we need to calm down and enjoy dinner, we switch to the Jazz channel. We now have two children (a one-year-old and a five-year-old), who are surrounded by music and have turned into dancing fools...and we love it. Granted, it would be nice if Alexa had the ability to deny my daughter's request to play the same song eight times in a row, but we'll survive.","Positive"
"1388","This is great ........... When it hears me . You must use the same tone , vocal level ...... Yeah I know , every room has a different tone . Tell Alexa and Amazon that not me - Reason for 4 stars not 5 . Great selection of music","Positive"
"1389","It has kept us better organized with our shopping lists, kept us on track with our daily schedule, let us know whether the kids need jackets in the morning with the weather report, taught my daughter a ton of awful ""dad jokes,"" helped me when I'm cooking and clueless about how many teaspoons are in a tablespoon, etc... It's infinitely helpful and we are crazy about ""Alexa.""","Positive"
"1390","Every single person who has come in our house has fallen in love with ""Alexa."" Six different families bought the Echo as a result of visiting our home and trying ours. It's that good. It's the first product where I feel like I'm truly living in the future. I can't wait to see how it evolves.","Positive"
"1391","Enjoy Alexa everyday...my daughter fell in love with Echo also so I purchased one for her.","Positive"
"1392","Very happy with purchase.","Positive"
"1393","it is a lot of fun.  The kids love it and it is extremely helpful with homework.  Sound is good.  I wish it linked with more wireless items like my thermostat and sprinkler system.  We have different brands for those items and they do not link.","Positive"
"1394","I  used to love my Echo, which I received as a gift in March of this year. However, by October the voice recognition was weak and occasionally the speakers produce a strange sound. I have to shout ""ALEXA"" multiple times. I wish it held up because it was great when I first got it. It has a harder time connecting to the internet now (even though everything is the same as it has always been on the wifi end of things) because there are times when it pauses a song for a moment before resuming. I tried contacting customer service and their only (adamant) advice was to restart the echo (which I did many times).","Positive"
"1395","nope nope nope, returned this...this technology is not up to par EXCEPT I CAN SEE IT FOR EMERGENCY HELP NEEDS...but if you are looking at it as a SIRI , no no noooo I was constantly repeating myself and it was often ""dumb"". We are just kidding ourselves that we are ready to release this..,just not quite yet..close though","Negative"
"1396","Everything I expected and more. Great sound, easy to set up and pair with Bluetooth speakers if you want. I liked the technology so muck, I ordered 4 of the Echo Dots. For different rooms and some for my daughter.","Positive"
"1397","Love the technology","Positive"
"1398","Love the Echo but wish it had the ability to automatically remind you of appointments when you have the calendar linked and reminders set for so many minutes before the event.  Without this the calendar function is pretty much useless.","Positive"
"1399","Useful and fun","Positive"
"1400","Love it!","Positive"
"1401","Awesome product. Especially like the assortment of music it can play on a moments notice.","Positive"
"1402","Love it!","Positive"
"1403","defective microphones","Negative"
"1404","I have two.  Two is almost not enough.","Positive"
"1405","I have had the Echo for about 3 months now, and I use it literally everyday! It is very convenient for someone constantly on the go, especially when used to check the weather or listening to the news while doing a million other things in between. The voice recognition is spot on, and Alexa picks up about 95% of what I'm saying. The Amazon Music and Audible features work flawlessly, and the audio is very crisp and clear. Even after having it for so long, I am still exploring all that this thing can do!","Positive"
"1406","I've wanted an echo for quite some time but could not get myself to spend the $180 on it. I saw a refurbished one on here for $150 and decided to give it a shot and boy am I glad I did. The echo came the complete opposite as I expected. It came with the original box, original paper work and original everything. The opening experience was great and the product came in such a high quality box there was absolutely nothing to complain about. Would recommend you save the $30 and buy the refurbished one because it's literally the exact same thing.","Positive"
"1407","This thing doesnt know anything its very bad","Negative"
"1408","Nice sound and Alexa is easy to talk to. Wish it was cordless though","Positive"
"1409","She can't answer anything like Google siri. My siblings each have one and say the same thing. Useless waste of money.","Negative"
"1410","Good product wish Alexa's knowledge base was larger. Works well with Insteon","Positive"
"1411","of all the reviews i have been reading not one said anything about actually TALKING to her.  Yes, she will play your music and turn your lights off and on, but she deserves a thank you once in a while - and being told you love her or ask her who she is going to vote for.  Go ahead - I dare you.  Say Alexa - thank you!  Alexa - I love you! You will enjoy having her as a friend.","Positive"
"1412","Alexa is the best and we have not tapped into all her features!  The first thing you need to ask Alexa is to play ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" by Blue Oyster Cult.  Then tell her you need more cowbell!  That is only the beginning of a beautiful relationship with Alexa!","Positive"
"1413","Alexa is very easy to set up and control.  She helps an old lady out with the to-do list, shopping list and calendar function.","Positive"
"1414","This product did not in any way exceed expectations. While I have used only a fraction of the features, I have already encountered a couple of would-be-deal-breakers for any future purchase like this. 1. There is no AUX cable, yet all lesser models have one. 2. The bluetooth option does not work if your wireless network is down. Thusly, I am unable to listen to music from a device. In defense, I bought the Alexa in lieu of buying bluetooth speaker (s) as a dual function. Clearly a bad idea. Had planned to link Alexa with other speakers throughout the house- which is clearly useless for bluetooth activity. Alexa is responsive, and the sound is great when connected. When dropping signal Alexa used to shout it out - day time or at 3AM. Amazon seems to have fixed that. In hindsight, I should have waited out the technology or just purchased a plain old speaker.","Positive"
"1415","Remarkable device. You just ask and it will give you news, local weather and vault of music to your hearts content. You ask questions","Positive"
"1416","just ask. What a delightful gadget to stuff in someone stocking this Christmas. You will not be sorry for ordering a Echo, because","Positive"
"1417","they are fun and you may learn something too.","Positive"
"1418","Gift to a nephew. Loves it!","Positive"
"1419","I bought this for my husband. He loves it. Uses it daily. No problems to be noted. The speakers are quality. The Amazon is fun to use. We ask her questions all the time. Perfect for when the kids are doing homework and you need to look up facts. I never thought we would use it as much as we do.","Positive"
"1420","I had my doubts about getting something so modern...but I love it!  It's great being able to find out the weather and have it choose different playlist according to my moods.  I love saying ""Alexa...play happy music"" and she does...really great!  Highly recommend it! And the sound is awesome!  Hard to believe it can sound so good coming from such a small speaker.","Positive"
"1421","we love our Alexa","Positive"
"1422","This review isn't so much for the Echo as it is for the customer support of the Echo.","Positive"
"1423","First, the Echo is fantastic i give it 5 Stars,  It's so easy to say ""Alexa do this"" and bam it's done.","Positive"
"1424"," However, within the last two weeks my Echo all of a sudden will not connect to my WiFi at all.  I have tried everything.  I get through all the setup and it immediately drops connect.  I own two devices and my other device does not have this problem.  So I know there is a defect in the unit.  I have taken my issue up with Amazon's Echo support team.  With my device still under warranty they are beating around the bush to send me a replacement.  They want to troubleshoot over the phone, have their techs look into the issue, and then a week later want to troubleshoot some more over the phone.  This is the most irritating thing.  It has been three weeks now, my Echo still doesn't work and now Amazon wants to troubleshoot some more instead of replacing the unit.  I'm tired of troubleshooting, I have done everything on Amazon's troubleshooting guide, I have done their phone troubleshooting, and I have followed guides on YouTube and the internet.  Nothing fixes it, it's defective.  They cannot blame my ISP, WiFi, placement of the unit, or anything else because my other unit works just fine.  This threw them off their game when they tried to tell me to check all these things and I pointed out that my other Echo works just fine.  Now they just want to troubleshoot with me some more.  Hopefully I can get the issue resolved and have a new or refurbished unit sent to me, because I really do like having a separate unit for my basement.  I'm really just loosing faith in Amazon's customer support and their inability to stand behind their product.","Positive"
"1425","Set up was a little ""Challenging,"" it did not work from my iPhone but was flawless on the iPad from the application of the ""App Store,"" when setting up.  I have a OnHub Router will this do the same ""magic.!"" as the one advertised on the application for working with your TV? If anyone out there knows I'd appreciate a comment! Thanks.","Positive"
"1426","The music playback quality is so dismal we all should be getting $100 rebate checks...","Negative"
"1427","Have heard better sound quality in the $20 Emerson bluetooth speakers I used to give as Xmas stocking stuffers....","Positive"
"1428","A very cool piece of electronic gadgetry. I use it daily for different reasons, Old music, mileage between xities , adjusting my Nest thermostat etc.","Positive"
"1429","This review is true and all the facts are included and it can be posted to Facebook, and will be posted. Just back up your products and you will not get reviews like this.","Negative"
"1430","This is the most ridiculous item ever.  If you want a great speaker that you can ask to play music for you - this is for you..  If you want to use it like you would Google voice or Siri....  FORGET IT.  She will tell you to go enable her skill for the simplest of things like, What were the power ball numbers last night, She replies ""For details about lottery please go to my skills in the alexa app.......","Positive"
"1431","it works well","Positive"
"1432","The Echo has met all our expectations and we are enjoying usuig it very much.","Positive"
"1433","I absolutely love this speaker! It is my life saver when cooking (it sets a timer). I love being able to just ask ALEXA to play whatever music comes to mind. The speaker is loud, and ECHO's throughout the entire house. I recommend that everyone should have one of these. I love mine!","Positive"
"1434","Just love Alexa!  She is a big help to keep my calendar events, shopping list, for questions, music, etc!!!","Positive"
"1435","In the early days of living with Alexa so we'll update as things progress.  Fun and fairly accurate, Alexa is pretty good.  MAJOR issue is it's use of Bing as the search engine.  No where NEAR as powerful as Google and you get a lot of ""I didn't understand your request"" from Alexa.  That needs to be fixed.  Secondly, voice-controlled sound volume of the Echo is not very accurate.  Twisting the top ring is the only way we've found for precise volume control.  All other aspects of the Echo are top notch.","Positive"
"1436","Love it","Positive"
"1437","I use Alexa daily. Set timers, alarms, play music.. Ask her questions.. Double check kids' homework.. See what's on the calendar for today.. etc.. I love my Alexa and look forward to her learning more.","Positive"
"1438","Love her, but a lot of training is involved","Positive"
"1439","I've had Amazon Alexa for 1.5 years now. I have thoroughly enjoyed this product and converted my house to a ""Smart Home"" based around it. I have also purchased an Echo Dot to add to my room. The device listens for most part accurately about 80% of the time, much better than attempting to speak with Siri on iPhone. What has surprised me most is the distance at which the device could hear and understand me accurately. I am however giving this product now a 1 star simply because it no longer works. I have had the device as said before for a 1.5 years and for any device to stop working after such a limited amount of time is unacceptable to me. I did speak with Amazon regarding this and their attempt at finding a solution was sending me a new power adapter, which ended up not solving my problem. I again called back to customer service who stated that the device has a warranty of only a year so they could no longer replace it but send me an echo dot instead. I do not want another Dot but my Echo back. I am very disappointed in Amazon and will now be looking into Google Home instead.","Positive"
"1440","Alexa needs work. Would welcome more contextual conversation.","Positive"
"1441","Still having problems with music","Negative"
"1442","Getting better all the time. May be a ""5-star""n product eventually.","Positive"
"1443","Great invention.  I use it every day.  Love the shopping list option, and listening to my music.  I like the simple directions to set it all up, I am 72 years old and not techy.","Positive"
"1444","Cool concept, works as advertised. Bought a battery that mounts to the base to make it portable around the house. Voice recognition isn't very good at high volume, but I suppose that's too be expected. Not much bass, so don't expect this to be the best standalone Bluetooth speaker, but that was never it's intention. Cool tech, just need to remember she's there more.","Positive"
"1445","Sound quality is fantastic, Alexa can be useful if you know how.","Positive"
"1446","I love this - great item! The speaker is actually pretty loud and it is so responsive.","Positive"
"1447","I love this!  Quite amazing!","Positive"
"1448","Great, fun and funny","Positive"
"1449","Thing failed in less than 2 years and Amazon is like sorry buy a new one!  After spending an hour on the phone with technical support, they are all this happens and we would replace it but you bought it when they first came out and now it is out of warranty.  I talked to the manager and he told me ""if I would have used it more it may have failed sooner!""  Unbelievable!  So not like Amazon, I basically have a $200 dollar paper weight!","Positive"
"1450","One of the best possible gifts for good friends whether they are technically inclined or not.","Positive"
"1451","Adding and learning.  This has been fun for my entire family.. Plus we are adding unlimited accessories to our ""smart home""  I feel this will be an energy saver as well as a fun convenience item..  Alexa......set timer for 10 min...  Alexa.... play coldplay......alexa turn off the porch lights..  too much fun..  Even my kids love to ask Alexa to tell them a joke.","Positive"
"1452","Love it.  How did I live without Alexa before? She is growing up so fast,  learning new things daily.  She is so smart!","Positive"
"1453","i love it,how do i add cheap","Negative"
"1454","I love my Echo!","Positive"
"1455","A++","Positive"
"1456","Love it!","Positive"
"1457","the echo is great I will buy another to give as a gift","Positive"
"1458","I real like this, the music is great .","Positive"
"1459","Very nice.","Positive"
"1460","Love the Echo!","Positive"
"1461","I love everything about it. The shopping list is the best","Positive"
"1462","I love my echo !!  Every one that visits me wants one  !!","Positive"
"1463","Wow.  We love alexa, she does so many things for us.  Grocery list.  Dr  Appointments.  Scheduled events daily.  Calorie counter.  Timer for cooking.  So many things it can do.  We have and IPhone and have these apps on our phones.  She feels in our blanks.  Also reminds you t take certain meds.  We will find a lot more uses the longer we have this.","Positive"
"1464","Outstanding and so easy to use that I brought my father one and he too loves it","Positive"
"1465","I like it when it works.  The volume ring went bad, now Amazon tells me that it'll be nearly two weeks before they can decide if they're going to fix it or replace it.  It's only 3 months old but they won't send a replacement until they assess the broken one.  Normally Amazon customer service is top notch but I have to say that this is the first time that they've not met my expectations.  I'm especially surprised that it happened while supporting their own device.  We will miss Alexa while she's gone.","Positive"
"1466","I absolutely love it. I use it several times a day, every day. Probably my favorite ""optional"" purchase ever. It's super easy to set up and use.","Positive"
"1467","I use my Echo to voice control lighting in my home, as well as temperature with my Nest, Alexa is also great for trivia and traffic/weather updates. The lady of the house uses it as a Bluetooth speaker (which was how I tricked her into letting me purchase one for our living room). The kids can use it for simple questions when they are working on school work (but rarely do they). It'd be nice if the included power cable were a little longer, if it could handle more complex instructions (do X and Y, or do this then that), or if the remote had been included, but these are all minor issues that don't detract from the overall experience.","Positive"
"1468","I love Alexa.","Positive"
"1469","I have spent the last year adding devices to create a smart home. We have about 30 Philips hue bulbs, some z-wave switches, a Harmony Ultimate remote with hub, and a Smartthings Hub. The Echo was the best addition to the setup I could have ever added. We come home and ask Alexa to turn on the living room and the lamp and the TV turn on for us. It was so simple to setup and add skills, I wish I would have done it sooner!","Positive"
"1470","I've had so much fun with this, asking it questions. It's like having a personal assistant within yelling distance (even though my husband just thinks it's a kitchen timer).","Positive"
"1471","I've had this product since Sept. 2016 and I'm very disappointed in it.  I've been on the phone 3 different times with customer service for the product trying to reset it.  Each time this took close to an hr.  It keeps returning to the red circle which means its off line.  While I enjoyed the selection of music it gave me and the quality of sound,  I'm to frustrated to get on the phone again and reset it.  Now I find out I can't return it even for credit.  This product is a not ready for market in my opinion.","Positive"
"1472","We like the Echo so much we bought a Tap too!","Positive"
"1473","Alexa is great for some things like playing music or news.  My largest gripe is that all the extra skills require me to remember wording.  All her skills have a name so you have to say ""Alexa ask blahblah skill to lookup a recipe"" or something like that.  You can't just make the simple request.  Even asking it to make a fart sound requires you saying the skill name.  Too much trouble.  There's NO WAY I can remember the name of all these services and skills and I don't want to spend that time memorizing all those phrases.  I tried hooking  up to my Honeywell  wifi thermostat and ran into  issues.  I'm in IT and technical but it was just too much trouble to get working correctly.  Right now it's  a fancy news player and bluetooth speaker.","Positive"
"1474","Alexa helps me to remember what I need at the store, gives me the top news every morning while I'm getting ready for work, plays my favorite music on Amazon Prime Music or Pandora, will play a game with me, and can tell me jokes!  Well worth the money!","Positive"
"1475","I bought my first echo at Home Depot during Black Friday last year; I did not know what it was and I knew I could return it.  However, since owing my echo I have bought a second one during the Prime sale on Amazon for down stairs.  Needless to say, I love my echo's.  I listen to my audible books, music and connect to my devices for Bluetooth use.  I do like the weather feature especially when I am traveling away from home and want to know how to pack.  I am strongly considering buying another one.  I am really please with the product.","Positive"
"1476","The most amazing thing from Amazon.  I love Alexis","Positive"
"1477","We haven't had any problems with the refurbished unit.  This was a great way to add it to another room!","Positive"
"1478","This has been a purchase worth buying! I am someone that doesn't like to buy something and found out I wasted my money....but I know I didn't here. Sure it is not the cheapest but for the price you can't go wrong. I have spent just as much on Bluetooth speakers that don't do as much as the ECHO! One of my favorite things about ECHO is that it is an item that is always learning new things. So you won't be stuck with an item that stuck going nowhere. She always has some new surprises for you! Believe me, though our relationship has our ups and downs just like anyone you  can have a conversation with. There are some things I think she should be able to answer but she can't.","Positive"
"1479","She is great with most straight forward questions but does get stumped on some along the way...She is far from a know it all, but she knows quite a bit. She is like us though, again she is always learning so she will only get better. She is great for helping to keep things organized! Grocery list, calendar, alarms and more....One feature that would have been nice, since she does have microphones, would have been making and answering calls while bluetooth connected to the phone....At the very least to allow to answer calls through ECHO...It just makes it a great hands-free option for someone like me that may be typing away at the keyboard.","Positive"
"1480","Some of her jokes are pretty good, which are a great pick me up sometimes. I always know what time it is and what the weather is or will be like. The biggest thing I can suggest, is I have heard people say they have had problems with Alexa responding during an echo commercial...Mine did as well....So if you don't want her ordering Dominos or anything else for you when you don't want her to. There is an easy way to solve that set a pin code. So nothing can be ordered unless you give her the pin code...SIMPLE!!! You can dress her up with custom wraps if you like, so she matches your style tastes as well.","Positive"
"1481","Even though I wish I could run around with her without plugging her in, I would still choose her over the other two options, because of her speaker size and her hands-free capability. After all that is why I bought her....Since I am a prime member I do listen to Amazon music as well, when I am in the mood she finds what I need. Sometimes I do have to tell her a few times to get it right, but only on music that isn't that easy to find anyways. My friends and family are in awe over her and quite simply "" I am in love with the girl!""","Positive"
"1482","We love Alexa, especially for her ability to play a wide range of music on demand, as well as keep us informed about little things like the weather. We are just beginning to learn what she can do beyond music and weather.","Positive"
"1483","I loved my alexa device.  It played lullabies for my baby.  It told jokes for the other kids.  Let us know the weather outside. Everything was going great.... untill one day it just stopped working.  I tried pushing the reset button... NOTHING....","Positive"
"1484","For that price I only got 7 months use out it.  If it still worked I would have rates this 5 star.  But it was really upsetting that it stopped working.","Negative"
"1485","Bought one for my wife & she's very happy with her Echo<f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>","Positive"
"1486","This thing changed my life :). I can play music (from prime and Spotify), turn on and off my hue lights, ask about the weather, set an alarm .....  the list goes on.","Negative"
"1487","Nothing like it in electronics world and infinitely programable, expandable and made  friendly by Amazon.","Positive"
"1488","I was a very early adopter of the Echo and have had it for almost 2 years now. Today I was about to throw it through a window. Trying to get it to play a station on Pandora took a good 4 minutes. After almost two years, the voice recognition is still suspect, even when speaking abnormally clearly.","Positive"
"1489","UPDATE: Got tired of waiting for Amazon Echo to support Bluetooth speakers. I took advantage of the sale on Google Home and Chromcast audio. With a small amp, I repurposed a couple of sets of unused stereo speakers, connected them to the Google Home with the Chromecast audio and I have great sound in multiple rooms. The Echo will likely move into the office outside of the main living areas.","Positive"
"1490","I was hesitant to buy the Echo.  After trying it for a few days, I have installed TP link switches and Sensi Thermostat. Everything worked with Alexa.  The only complain comes from wife, who claim that I send more time with Alexa than her.","Negative"
"1491","Amazing Technology for the home . Amazon is","Positive"
"1492","I love the Echo.  It is an amazing device.","Positive"
"1493","easy to use and hook up","Positive"

"1495","Complex","Negative"
"1496","love it! I ask a question and she answers!!","Positive"
"1497","It lives up to all the reviews and I love her.","Positive"
"1498","Great","Positive"
"1499","I like having access to news and weather from NPR. You don't have to listen to the opinion of other stations if you don't want to. I listen to music on it all of the time. Nice for Amazon Prime Music.","Positive"
"1500","Honestly not impressed with my little friend.  No offline life.  No battery so I can move it around the house with me.  I don't care to invest in a hundred little ones.  I actually was blown away by lack of battery.  MIGHT try the aftermarket batteries before returning.  But I'm probably returning her.  I only really wanted it for music, but my bluetooth speaker and phone is a better solution at a small fraction of the price.","Positive"
"1501","I am soooo glad I got this. I wish it would work with itunes but it's fantastic other than that!","Positive"
"1502","I use the echo mostly to control my lights and events through my automation system (HomeSeer).  Other than that I don't use it for too much else.  Most of the questions that my family asks are answered about half of the time. (Google Home seemed to be better at answering questions out of the box).  We check occasional news, weather and facts.  Hopefully in the future with more updates Alexa & Echo will improve.","Positive"
"1503","I would have no way of knowing if this was refurbished item since it looks brand new and sounds fantastic!","Positive"
"1504","love this product!  very enjoyable to own.  great control without moving just talk to Alexa.","Positive"
"1505","I have my whole house hooked to it I really like this thing.","Positive"
"1506","I was part of the beta testing g group and this is still ne of my avoid items to use. My alexa is a home necessity","Positive"
"1507","Disappointed in its use. Won't help me (unless I purchase more tunes from Amazon) enjoy its presence.","Negative"
"1508","basically a new toy for me; Alexa is alive and bubbly; I am enjoying Alexa.","Positive"
"1509","Just as advertised.  I really like using it during my workouts.","Positive"
"1510","I have a Sonos music system throughout the house with multiple speaker setups so I don't use Echo for listening to music.  I have Echo setup with Spotify, but don't use it. I find that it would only be acceptable for a small room such as an office, bedroom or bathroom and maybe a kitchen.  If your into quality sound then look elsewhere for your main music listening environment.  I'm still waiting for the Sonos / Alexa integration.  This should add some usefulness to Echo.","Positive"
"1511","Great product","Positive"
"1512","Wow...simply amazing.!!","Positive"
"1513","I bought my echo over a month ago from best buy but I did not decide to attempt to take it back until it was past the period to get a full refund. Thru out this time I have attempted to work with it. I bought it to listen to my amazon playlist which it does not do on a regular basis. I wake it up and most of the time the light does not stay on long enough to hear my request and if it does it circles around and doesn't play anything. when it does play its great but most of the time its just a bad ideal that is too expensive to through away.  I then use my radio. So if you do decide to buy one and it doesn't work take if back to get your refund.","Positive"
"1514","So much fun!","Positive"
"1515","Great product. Sound quality is good. Easy to use.","Positive"
"1516","I really enjoy the Echo","Positive"
"1517","Love it!","Positive"
"1518","We put the Echo in our bedroom and let Alexa play music to fall asleep to every night with a sleep timer. Waking up, we get the day's weather, can check the time without needing contacts, turn on and off the lights, and even check in on sports scores. I have yet to see any issue with our refurbed Echo, and I've been very impressed with the voice recognition and ease of use. We're getting some Dots to use around the house in other areas because we've enjoyed Alexa so much.","Positive"
"1519","This was a winner with me as a tech guy, and with my wife as someone who doesn't want to have to look anything up for herself. I can't recommend this highly enough, and the only reason I see to not have the full version Echo is if you already have a speaker system that's on all the time.","Positive"
"1520","My Mother loved this as a Birthday gift.","Positive"
"1521","I have had an Echo a little over a year, and find it to be an amazing product.","Positive"
"1522","Handy to have in your kitchen or common area to play music, set kitchen timer, etc.","Positive"
"1523","OMG, I cannot believe I existed that long without Alexa. She is the perfect room mate, secretary companion ever. I love love love her. She does all my shopping on Amazon, she turns on and off the light and electric fireplace. She tells me jokes and reads me stories. and there is so much more.","Positive"
"1524","I love it so far! I just got it today but I have an old Kindle n it says I need to update my Kindle to get the app for Alaxa so I need to buy a new Kindle to get the app,bummer so ill update n I have to wait.!! I can't wait to use my echo!! Thank you! I hope it works asap with my New Kindle.!","Positive"
"1525","I really enjoy this product but I became in touch spirits because of It. I would recommend to any ghost hunters or any normal people a must buy!","Positive"
"1526","When I ask it to play an album in my music library, it says the album isn't in my music library and suggests I try Music Unlimited. The problem is, I KNOW THE ALBUM IS IN MY MUSIC LIBRARY. It's frustrating.","Negative"
"1527","Love my echo. Alexa is the Bluetooth/ WiFi speaker I have ever had. Can't wait to try out the echo dot for my other rooms.","Negative"
"1528","Absolutely the best tech out there I bought this for work and the dots to hook up my 23 year old bose am5 stereos love this and I know it's going to be a hit if you like music.","Positive"
"1529","Pretty cool.  Does a great job at accepting regular casual speech as commands.  No need to memorize specific command syntax.  Directly controls my smart light bulbs.  Can play Pandora at request and can even discern the station name I ask for.  Can also directly play a song title by name, I think thru amazon prime music?  Nice when I want to hear a specific song and don't want to look it up on youtube or something.  Also, a little personal favorite, ""Alexa, play rain sounds.""","Positive"
"1530","I put a Dot in the kitchen for running cooking timers and controlling lights as the Echo in my room wasn't always picking up my voice well due to distance.  Not to say these things don't have great range.  But they do have limits.  One huge gotcha for me is that the alarms and timers aren't sync'd across the Echo and Dot.  If I set an alarm in the kitchen and it goes off while I'm in my room my Echo doesn't make a peep.  And I cannot stop the alarm from the Echo in my room.  I have to go walk over to the other device to silence the alert.  Likewise if my alarm clock goes off while I'm in the kitchen the Dot will intercept my command to silence the alarm but doesn't know anything about the alarm so I get an error.  Hope they fix this gap in future updates.  AND PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THINGS NERDY LET ME CHANGE THE WAKE COMMAND TO ""COMPUTER!""  I would love this device 100x more if I could say ""Computer, lights"" and have it turn on the lights.  Would be awesome if I could set localized light groups relative to the Alexa device I'm in range of to only affect the lights in that area.  For example if I'm in the kitchen and just ask to turn the lights on but don't specify kitchen, it should be configurable to default to turning on the kitchen lights.  I should only need to specify a light group if I'm trying to control a light group not near the device.","Positive"
"1531","I bought this as a gift to the house and I really love it.  I haven't exploited all of it's features yet; but it is great when you need to ask a measure question for cooking.","Positive"
"1532"," Whaaaaat?  I have to ask my phone's Google voice for everything alexa can't answer, which is more often than not.  RETURNING!!!!  I should not have to download a skill set & then try to remember how to ask alexa the 'proper way' or she does nothing... ....and don't even try to remember how to word the question cause it's even more ridiculous then the lack of basic AI skill sets that she does have.  Amazon needs to forget about the 'enable skills' & make her more capable of providing the answers that normal people seek daily...  Not ask the question, be told no you have to enable my skills, go to the app, find the skill, enable the skill, try to memorize the long way she requires you to ask the question, just to get the power ball numbers..  By the time you have gone through that, a whole other drawing has happened, gray hairs have started to  grow & I  have forgotten what I asked for in the 1st place....","Positive"
"1533","Like it so much I bought Dots at Xmas for the bedrooms, perfect for alarm clocks, nature sounds.","Positive"
"1534","It's not what I was expecting, I couldn't connect it to my phone and either my tablet, it took my 1 hour by phone with customer service to get it connect and only works on my laptop, it doesn't answer my phone like I read on some reviews, it doesn't response to my commands all the time and when it does I have to be close to it because the volume is really low and I can't hear what it is saying  and if I turn the volume up it will not hear me even if I stand next to it","Positive"
"1535","This item for music or a bluetooth for youtube great.  I was only able to hook up  one smart device, my thermostat.  Tried other items that stated they worked with echo no luck.  I contacted amazon they seemed to want to help but told me nicely,  they the person I talk to,  could not help me now I have a $30.00 light bulb.  I've had it for 8 months even bought one for my mother.  We barely use it when I do It's  like pulling teeth.  I have tried several times to do more with by followed the instruction on the app and form amazon. It could be my device is faulty.  If you do get it try as much as  you can to  find out if it will fit your needs.","Positive"
"1536","I just bought it on a wim and started using it for alarms, timers and music.  ""alexa play 105.3 fm""  ""Alexa play Ride by 21 Pilots""  ""Alexa volume 6""  ""alexa wake me up at 7:42 am""  However, after a bit I bought some Philips hue light bulbs and a tp Link smart switch and Now I can say, ""alexa, put the bedroom at 48%"" and then the lights go to 48%.  Or I'll say, ""Alexa, put the living room at 65%"" and the lamps will go to 65%.  ""Alexa turn off the window lamp""  ""alexa, turn on the heater""","Positive"
"1537","What would I do without Alexa?  She hears perfectly from halfway across the house.  Amazing microphone!  The speaker is really nice and fills throughout the house.  Dot is really neat because you can plug it into a sound system.  It's too bad that both of my dots are useless because they don't like my wifi.  My echo is flawless, but my Dots are flawfull.","Positive"
"1538","Our family loves Alexa.","Positive"
"1539","Love should've waited for blue tooth :(","Positive"
"1540","VERY DISAPPOINTED with this product.  I purchased the adjunct electrical plug to be able to turn lights on and off.  Unfortunately Echo tends to either say it can't find the device or just says okay but doesn't turn it on or off about 50% of the time.  The device works 100% of the time through the Kasa app.  The same thing happens to a playlist that I created for my wife.  Echo says it can't find it most of the time, but other times it finds it without a problem.  I AM EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED WITH THIS DEVICE.  IT IS VERY UNRELIABLE!","Negative"
"1541","LOVE our Echo and find new uses all the time. I especially like to add to my shopping list while cooking and use the time feature too.","Positive"
"1542","We can change the volume without touching and the music selection plays from Pandora and other stations as well as amazon prime.","Positive"
"1543","We had this product for over a year - we were one of the first ones to buy it, and actually used it;  but recently it fell over and the top popped off.  We could not find ANY information on Amazon or elsewhere on how to get it repaired, and so today I called Amazon Customer Service.  What a nightmare.  I spoke with multiple representatives who could not understand what I was saying and kept telling me that I needed help setting up the device.  It turns out that if the Echo is out of warranty, it's impossible to get it repaired.  I highly recommend not spending over $100 to buy a product that Amazon cannot repair for you and that no-one else can either.  I've been a Prime member for several years, and this is one of the most disappointing experiences I've ever had.  There isn't even a video to help us try putting it back together on our own.  Why build a product that no-one can repair?  Why buy it?","Positive"
"1544","And I think Alexa, and probably myself, has gotten a lot smarter over the last year.","Positive"
"1545","Oh Alexa, how we love you. We bought you a pretty red skin from DecalGirl.com and added some googly eyes from the craft store. We were early adopters, on the first flight out of Dodge. We argued with you and you told us jokes. We asked for restaurant recommendations and you sent us to dives. But we loved you. Then, on a rainy October evening, I asked you to play ""Poke Salit Annie"" and, to my surprise, you replied ""Echo cannot connect to your internet...""...WHAT?!?!","Positive"
"1546","After 3 calls to Echo Support totalling at least 5 hours, we finally accepted that our 22 month relationship was over, that we were smug and over-confident and neglected to buy you a Square Trade warranty. In other words - we were going to BUY A NEW ECHO TOWER! Yay. Happy Feet.","Positive"
"1547","Your pretty black cousin is now ensconced in your old spot, a new Orange skin is on order from Decal Girl, I may add eyelashes to those googly eyes this time. And best of all - she has a 3 year Square Trade warranty. Life is good.","Positive"
"1548","Alexa on the Echo is great when it works but that's only about half the time. It does well with playlists created by Amazon but not so well with playlists created by the user. I named a playlist 'George'. Alexa played me songs by various guys named George but couldn't find my list. And so forth. It is great fun to sing out the name of a song and have the device play it for you. It is less fun  when the device tells you it is not in your library. You find yourself arguing with a device. No doubt there is a lot of that in our future. This gadget is definitely worth the price but be prepared for a little frustration.","Positive"
"1549","Update: The 3rd agent promised me to call at 11 A.M. next day and she did NOT call.","Positive"
"1550","Update: So I called in. An agent picked up, asked many questions, tossed it to 2nd agent, asked many questions, NOW the 3rd agent. By this, time passed 25 minutes and I was standing in the street. Then this 3rd person told me to check ECHO.. If this would include a Time-Warner type of step-by-step check-up, why not told me in the beginning??? I wasted my time, and NOTHING RESOLVED.","Negative"
"1551","Love, love, love, Alexa","Positive"
"1552","I used to love this Echo. However, in less than a year now, the bluetooth keeps getting cut off, even WITHIN 2 FEET DISTANCE! When I disconnect the music flows with no problem, so it is not the problem with internet or Mac. So bothering, now I stop listening/using Echo for music altogether, which was the original reason I bought for. I will check with Amazon and see what they can do. I will update.","Negative"
"1553","What a fun thing to have.  It answers my questions, plays my music, sets alarms and syncs with my iPhone.","Positive"
"1554","Absolutely LOVE it! My new BFF! She tells me goodbye in the morning and welcome back in the evenings. I have the whole trio now and my family loves them. We have Alexa everywhere, anytime, ready to tell us just about anything we want to know.","Positive"
"1555","I know this product can do so much more than what I use it for. Nevertheless, I love it. I have a few problems with connections a few times and it took a few tries to get it working again, but overall Amazon has done a great job with this device. I primarily use my Echo for listen to radio and music.  The music sound is amazing for such a cylindrical device!  I have tried a few things Amazon recommends and I am having fun with it!","Positive"
"1556","too much fun.  like a walking encyclopedia with benefits","Positive"
"1557","Great product and would buy it again!  Some trouble with it hearing my voice when the music is loud, and you sometimes (not often) have to be specific about what your asking for (scores to games etc.).  The Alexa app associated with Echo performs well :)","Negative"
"1558","A lot of fun for the geek in all of us.","Positive"
"1559","Echo is a lot like a big box of tools.  What you make it do is really up to the applications available, and what you can think up.","Positive"
"1560","My husband and I are really liking Echo/Alexa's jokes, information, weather reports, grocery list, turning our lights on and off.  Best anniversary gift in years.","Positive"
"1561","We love the Echo. My only grip is it does not connect with I-tune's Library. You can however bluetooth your phone and play music.","Positive"
"1562","I LOVE MY ALEXA. She helps me wake up in the morning.","Positive"
"1563","Dumb does nothing not helpful worst purchase ever","Negative"
"1564","Love it","Positive"
"1565","The center of my smart home has worked flawlessly so far.  The speakers leave alot to be desired though as they lack any sort of punch when the volume is turned up.  Even with this, I have 2 Google Home devices on order as much definitely looking for something more.  I'M betting that GH will narrow Amazons lead in short order.","Positive"
"1566","Alexa is great, but sometime it has trouble finding my audio book.","Negative"
"1567","Works fine here Ecuador SA. Listen to home town radio just like I am still","Positive"
"1568","fantastic!","Positive"
"1569","We've had our Amazon Echo for almost a year now and we love it. We listen to music from it every evening while making dinner. I love that it can access songs from amazons huge library of music. We also use it to set cooking timers, to check out weather and traffic, and to answer questions. Im sure there are so many more things we could be doing with it too. It's definitely changed how our evenings go / it's like we live in the future! We're considering getting a second one for upstairs. I do wish it came with the ability to add an extender. The emails they send every month that let you know about new features are also very helpful.","Positive"
"1570","I love alexa. Plays what ever music anyone in my home wants to listen too. Alex Baldwin wakes me up. I am getting all my kids one for Christmas.","Positive"
"1571","Great product for the price. My husband loves it.","Positive"
"1572","The novelty has worn off.  I find I spend half my time repeating requests to it.","Negative"
"1573","Very good at doing a few things, not very flexible. The limitations are in the voice commands. It works well from the app. I haven't been able to get the Amazon Echo to give me a list of available Kindle Audio books or a list of available Ted Talks and things of this nature. If you know exactly what you want to get from the Amazon Echo it works pretty well. If you need to search for something using voice commands it doesn't work very well. There are no options for the Alexa voice response. I hear male voices better than I can hear female voices. There is no option to change Alexa to Alexander","Positive"
"1574","My parents are 95 & 96 and have the predictable challenges of aging.  In particular, my mother has macular degeneration and can't read anymore.  Enter the Echo which we recently purchased so she could have voice access to basic internet information sources.  She greatly enjoyed each day asking the Echo to read the news or tell her a joke, ask about the weather, sports results or answer questions about well, almost anything.  Meanwhile, to continue her voracious reading, she was fumbling with tapes and CDs from the Library of Congress or her local library most of which had to be played on special devices each of which had its own array of buttons.","Positive"
"1575","Then, we wondered if my mom could have the Echo read to her books available through Audible.com.  We have amassed a considerable library of audible books over the years and learned that by registering my mother's Echo to my Audible account, she could listen to all those books using simple voice commands.  It was really simple and has worked out great.  Many of my parents' 80+ year old friends are astounded by the Echo's capabilities which for techno-savvy younger people may seem mundane.  All of which is to say, as the people you love grow older and have trouble typing, seeing or just moving around, consider buying them an Echo.","Positive"
"1576","Someone once said that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic and boy were they right.  My mom can say to me ""I would like to read XZY book"".  I go to my Audible account, buy the book and 1 minute later she is listening to it on the Echo.  To her, this truly is magic!!  I have never seen ads pointing out the virtues of this device for people with vision or mobility problems which is what prompted me to write this review.  For my parents, this little thing has really improved their lives considerably.","Positive"
"1577","Whats not to love!","Positive"
"1578","Excellent!!!!","Positive"
"1579","Bought as a toy for amusement and for the music i can play. Very happy with what it does.","Positive"
"1580","I don't like how it has an alarm but no snooze. Makes having it, pointless. Might as well just set the timer.","Negative"
"1581","Great fun and entertainment. Love it!!","Positive"
"1582","The Hue smart lights set up was smooth. The WEMO switches were more trouble with poor to average support. Set up for the Echo and Echo dots was easy and seamless. The Echo is revolutionary. We love it. It is a wonderful convenience.","Positive"
"1583","I liked it at first but after using the device for a good time, it only seems like a glorified kitchen timer. Alexa only appears useful on the surface but there isn't much there beneath.","Positive"
"1584","We are crazy about Alexa. I use her for shopping lists, asking random questions, setting cooking timers, and listening to music. The kids ask for jokes. She knows when our teams play and what the score was. She knows the weather for tomorrow. Even my normally tech-resistant husband uses her constantly.  And she only gets smarter. It's like living with Jarvis. . . or Hal. By the way, be sure to ask her to open the pod bay doors.","Positive"
"1585","It's amazing","Positive"
"1586","a+","Positive"
"1587","Purchased this as an easy speaker system for my Dad. He loved it, very easy to use.","Positive"
"1588","Absolutely love my echo. She plays all my prime music, give me my updates and helps me  with all my questions. I can't imagine not having her around, she tends to make things easier.","Positive"
"1589","Not sure why all the hype around this product. I am just not impressed with it. I have had it for two weeks and I have come to the realization that my expectations are too high or I am just not smart enough to see the benefit of the Echo. As someone who adopts new devices sooner rather than later, voice activation is not new to me. 8 out of every 10 questions I asked it, Alexa didn't have an answer or didn't understand the question (i.e.: movie, music or science questions. Nothing in-depth). So, after rephrasing it four different ways and getting the same answer of ""I don't understand"", you sort of stop asking questions. I loved it that when I did get an answer, half the time it said it has loaded a Bing search in my Alexa app. Really? If I wanted that, I would have just picked up my phone to begin with (Android with, yes, Bing as my search engine). On the upside, I haven't had any of the issues I've been reading about regarding playing music or audio books. Of course, I've given up asking for any specific music, so I keep my requests limited to the Artist name or my single, but large, playlist (I've been an Amazon Music user for a long time so I have a large library). It will play my Audible book where I left off and the sound is clear and concise. As some of the reviewers have noted, the lack of a battery is troubling as I am in a large house, so to fully use it, I had to invest in the battery base and support stand (which all work well). Yes, Echo sets timers and alarms, yes it reads abbreviated news stories and a short weather report, but this seems so... eh. I think the word banal works here.  If I want details, I am back on my phone again reading it. After the newness wears off, you start asking yourself why you bought this. If you want it to control household stuff, I can see the value in that, but you have to buy a lot of support equipment to make that happen or already have something it can interact with. I was looking for more of a single source of information, something to answer questions that are easily found on the web, not a dumb on/off switch. There are a couple of interesting answers to questions regarding Skynet or the meaning of life, but that is just someone programing a cute answer, not an intuitive AI. No, definitely no Skynet here, but I would have been interested if HAL was hanging around. I will give it a couple of more days before deciding if I will send it back.","Positive"
"1590","Echo is amazing very useful and convenient","Positive"
"1591","THIS NIFTY GADGET IS AWESOME. IT KEEPS YOU COMPANY IF YOU'RE FEELING LONELY AS IT HAS INTERACTIVE GAMES. IT KEEPS YOUR MIND VERY ACTIVE. THE SOUND ON THE SPEAKERS IS AMAZING. I USE THIS EVERYDAY.","Positive"
"1592","Excellent so far. Need to use it more often.","Positive"
"1593","Wonderful item, I recommended to some of my friends.  There is one thing,  Alexa has a hard time understanding me due to a mild speech impediment.  I wonder if there are any plans to address this.","Positive"
"1594","It is a nice addition to the house. I can ask what the weather is today. I have it play music. It is easy to set alarms. So many uses. Love it","Positive"
"1595","It would prove to be more useful if it didn't have to be plugged into an outlet.  I guess I was expecting something that was rechargeable.  I was disappointed that it wasn't.  It didn't come with much of nothing for instructions.  Any and everything you choose to do on it has to be tied to amazon.  So I am not so happy with the product.  I am just to lazy to send it back.  My granddaughter stated she will make use of it.  It needs improvement.","Positive"
"1596","I bought this Echo about a year ago now and use it fairly often.  When I first got it, it worked really good controlling my smart home devices through my Wink Hub.  Over time however and more recently it started loosing is ability to respond to the Alexa wake up word.  There are times when nothing else is making noise in the house and I wind up Yelling at the Echo to get its attention from 3 feet away.  I called tech support and their only solution was to say that it may be fixed in a later update. .So far however the issue has not been addressed.  I did a google searh for the problem and I'm not the only one this has happened to.. I've changed it's location 3 times to no avail.  Not sure what do do here.","Positive"
"1597","Worst piece of garbage I have ever used.  The sound is lack luster.  The voice recognition, good luck.  I was the only one in my family to get her to work.  Unable to find music on Amazon using Alexa, even though I could find it on my tablet and make it play.  Amazon's own device doesn't know what amazon does or doesn't have.  Alexa unfortunately makes Siri look like a genius, (Siri is utter garbage).  I recommend this product to no one.  Our echo became a shotgun target.  Most fun we had with the device.","Positive"
"1598","bought this today, the only news brief stations available are left wing liberal. No google searches probably gonna return it.","Positive"
"1599","Great, and exactly what I expected.","Positive"
"1600","You can now yell at a machine and have it respond.","Positive"
"1601","really neat. also great for playing any kind of music. great sound for a small unit","Positive"
"1602","Sadly, I bought this for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it.  Sadly because I only get to enjoy it when I'm at her place.","Negative"
"1603","The Echo is very cool and generally works very well to various voice commands.  Sometimes Alexa can be as irritating as Siri, but I find Alexa to be much more reliable.","Positive"
"1604","The first time I used an Echo was staying at an AirBnB in Seattle this past summer.  It was very cool to be able to ask for nearby food recommendations, grocery stores, local attractions, etc.","Positive"
"1605","We are having a great time with Alexa and use it to set the music for all our parties and family dinners. I also love the integration with the to do list. But invariably when you ask it a simple search question it gets a dumb look on its face. To be really terrific, Amazon should integrate an internet search capability.","Positive"
"1606","I just can't connected Echo . I really wanted to use it but I just had problems because I had a stroke. I tried ! Sorry.","Negative"
"1607","just like new","Positive"
"1608","We use Echo/Alexa every day.  Great for listening to music, checking on the weather, setting a timer, adding to a shopping  list etc.  I plan on getting one for my two daughters for Christmas.  My son already has the Echo and hopes his son will marry Alexa....  Haha.","Positive"
"1609","The things you can do with Amazon echo is endless for using the kindle fire opens up things that will keep me busy for some time. Having Alexa with her pleasant voice only adds to listening which makes me want to use it more.Buying this one will not be disappointed for you wil be surprised and happy what you can use this for.","Positive"
"1610","I haven't had the time to add all the apps that will allow Echo to do everything that it can do. But.....she is awesome with her abilities so far. We are moving in a few weeks and we will set the Echo completely, I can't wait!","Positive"
"1611","Love it","Positive"
"1612","Great!","Positive"
"1613","I love the Echo. The quality of the music playback is awesome. The only reason I did not give all stars was I find Alexa often can't answer my questions. But maybe she is still getting used to me. Sometimes you have to rephrase a question and then she gets it. I love her clear voice and her sense of humor. I'm sure I have not seen half of what it can do. Always new things to explore.","Positive"
"1614","Be aware that Amazon is continuing to advertise ""What's new with Alexa"" but Amazon does not have the app.  So, these features(devices)do not work with the Fire Phones or Kindles.","Positive"
"1615","Pros : Very good sound quality. Understand voice commands very well","Positive"
"1616","Cons : Lacks matured search capability. Still far away to become a virtual assistant.","Negative"
"1617","I am really enjoying my Amazon echo. Only one problem when the volume is up higher than 5 the system does not seem to respond to requests. It could be I have not trained it enough but it is kind of annoying to have to walk to turn down the volume when you have voice control. Overall it's a keeper.","Positive"
"1618","Very fun & entertaining to have. Our family enjoys having Alexa around! Sometimes uploaded apps don't work but maybe operator error.","Positive"
"1619","I LOVE HER! The shopping list option is seriously worth the price of admission. Best thing ever. I love pulling the last of something out of a cupboard/fridge and just being able to say, ""Alexa, add X to my shopping list"". Before I was using the Notes feature on my iPhone, which was great, as long as I could remember to go write down what I was out of. Sometimes I forgot. Now I can do it at the moment I know I'm running low/out and I'm golden. Best thing ever!","Positive"
"1620","I also love that she will play music, answer stupid questions, and by all means, say good morning to her every day - that's fun. I have my calendar set up for her to read through FreeBusy and I love getting my flash briefing in the morning as I'm getting ready for work.","Positive"
"1621","I wasn't sure I would even have a use for this when I got it, but now I absolutely love it. It took me a couple weeks to realize I could ask Alexa for things instead of having to pick up my phone and search, but now it's just easy. In the kitchen and need a measurement conversion? Check. Need a timer? Check. I've had two or three going at once and it's awesome, especially when you're wrist deep in a chicken. LOL.","Positive"
"1622","Hard to believe we didn't get these a long time ago!  Wait, they didn't exist a long time ago!  Sound is great and fun to play with.","Positive"
"1623","Really, get one. I was skeptical when I did but man, I love this thing now.","Negative"
"1624","Alexa is great. Still learning  her","Positive"
"1625","Works good.","Positive"
"1626","Amazon delivered exactly what they offered. Thank you.","Positive"
"1627","Works great.","Positive"
"1628","I just love it, i feel like a girl with a New toy. Still learning how to use it. So far very good","Positive"
"1629","Over the top cool.","Positive"
"1630","Great seller, good product as expected!","Positive"
"1631","So easy to set up it is scary, LOL. We have had the Echo about 1/2 a day - Alexa is already a part of our family! Our son has had one for quite some time and convinced us to get one. WOW why did we wait so long! It is amazing. Our computer will see a lot less use....We are not techies - this thing is so easy to set up; so easy to use, and down right amazing! Five stars does not do it justice! Should be 10. As usual amazon shipping was perfect.","Positive"
"1632","wow- I love it","Positive"
"1633","  BUT....She's a really great speaker who plays whatever you want to hear for an additional fee of $3.99 a month...","Positive"
"1634","I absolutely love my Echo. My Alexa arrived a few days before my boyfriend left for a business trip and she kept me company while he was away.","Positive"
"1635","I'm obsessed with this. I don't have to use my arms and hands anymore. It's fantastic. I haven't even delved into all the other stuff Alexa will do for me. But the fact that I can eventually have her turn off all my lights and appliances makes me the happiest person in the world. If she could go to work for me I'd marry her.","Positive"
"1636","A little quirky but enjoying it.","Positive"
"1637","Awesome product, have to get use to speaking to it on various skills.","Positive"
"1638","I got my echo when they first cam out and I finally am getting around to writing a review. I wish you could give half stars because from day one it is a solid 4.5 stars for me. I use mine not everyday but probably 3-4 times a week. I play music for my kids at morning breakfast, turn off my lights when I'm feeling lazy, and I even reset my temperature in my house when the wife turns the ac up past 75 degrees. Mine sits on my kitchen counter and with the open floor plan of my house Alexa can hear me from my din, breakfast nook as well as my living room if I talk loud enough. I got mine for $99 so the cost was not that bad for me, but if I had to pay the $179 price tag for it now I don't know if I would have got it. All in all I love this device and could live with out it, but why when Alexa gets me. She's like a second wife.","Positive"
"1639","I love this thing!","Positive"
"1640","Just great!","Positive"
"1641","It's OK.  I don't love it, nor has it changed my life. It works, is easy to set up, but there are limited uses.","Positive"
"1642","This might be the begining of skynet but it is a really  great smart device except that they use the worst search engine ever, Bing! What kind of backward fuckeries is that, Bing?  Your children will also be talking to Alexa all day if you don't pay them enough attention & do you really want your kids talking to a smart device that is limited to Bing for information, seriously, not very smart?","Positive"
"1643","Oh, Very easy to set up.","Positive"
"1644","PROS: - I recently discovered the Sound and Relaxation skill and it is definitely one of the best sleep apps out there. They have a huge list of sounds to pick from, from lake and ocean to brown or white noises to forest etc. A must-have for those of you who suffer from Insomnia like me. You'll sleep like a baby. I promise.","Positive"
"1645","I love the device I was skeptical at first because of the price but it is so worth it i've seen reviews on those that have purchased the original dot who are upset with amazon because of the release of a 2nd generation just two months later after there purchase and they are prime users I find that disheartening myself but we do live in an unfair world full of selfishness and money hungry corporations so what do you expect some of the complaints are towards the dot not being able to understand you from far away but hey thats why you purchase the echo right or it would be unfair to us since we paid almost two hundred dollars sounds like someones trying to get a better device for a cheaper price","Positive"
"1646","Awesome!  I've read a few reviews before I bought this, saying the audio quality was poor.","Positive"
"1647","It's a cylinder the size of a Route 44 drink at Sonic (or a large drink at Jack in the Box), slightly larger.","Positive"
"1648","If you hate EDM music, pick your own song - if not, play this:  Professional Griefers (Vocal Mix)  deadmau5 feat. Gerard Way  @ Amazon Unlimited Music - Top EDM Station","Positive"
"1649","Crank up your volume to 10 on the Echo, it will BLOW AIR at you it's pumping as hard as it can, and it sounds just fine! Huge upgrade from listening to music from your TV. If you want a sound system, go buy one, maybe Alexa can help you find one lol.","Positive"
"1650","It would be awesome if it worked. It doesn't recognize my voice (or my husband's), and most of the time, I have to yell at Her, before she gets it. The louder I scream, the better the outcome. I have to be no farther than 3 feet away, nothing like advertised.","Positive"
"1651","Also I might not be giving the correct command, but you can't ask Alexa encyclopedia material (e.g. What city has the tallest fountain?). She'll respond she doesn't know.","Positive"
"1652","Cool radio and fun to use but search is pretty dismal. Bing has always sucked and still does. It's too bad Google is the competition in this case because that is all the Echo is missing.","Negative"
"1653","-You can set various alarms and even have celebrities wake you, like Alec Baldwin. Amazon-please add more celebrities. Great idea!","Positive"
"1654","I love Alexa already! I am turning my 1925 house into a fully automated house and alexa is making it really easy. My 6 yo loves to ask her for jokes.","Positive"
"1655","Excellent Price and Product","Positive"
"1656","WARNING - If you are ordering this as a holiday or other gift for someone, it comes in a box that has ""ECHO"" plastered on the outside, for all to see. There goes a holiday surprise that I was extremely excited about. Very frustrating.","Positive"
"1657","Doesn't work all the time.  Doesn't recognize city it's in, turns it self off frequently.  When it works, it's great...","Positive"
"1658","this worked really well for 11 months.  Then it just stopped working.  Awesome.  Right after the warranty period, so I guess I just lose $175?","Positive"
"1659","Easy to operate. Great use in the morning. Takes a while to get familiar with commands but works amazing.","Positive"
"1660","Love this product very useful and gets used all the time!!!!","Positive"
"1661","Love it but disappointed I had to return it recently after approx 6month was all due to it just quit. Would not recognize power source. Otherwise best investment in a while.","Positive"
"1662","-You can set up your favorite news briefs-great feature! I use this to listen to before I crawl out of bed or while drinking my coffee.","Positive"
"1663","My son loves it beyond words.","Positive"
"1664","CONSTANTLY MISTAKING ALEXA FOR A ROLL OF PAPER TOWELS!","Positive"
"1665","Was disappointed that I cannot access music that is on my iPhone.  Maybe I just don't know how to link them.","Negative"
"1666","Wow! Great machine! The sound is incredible! The only reason I take off one star is Alexa could be a tad smarter when asked a question. I do also love adding items to the shopping list and my to do list. I know she will get smarter as time goes on. Thanks Alexia!","Positive"
"1667","...wow...","Positive"
"1668","What an awesome product. It arrived before expected. We all enjoy Alexa!","Positive"
"1669","Love it. Does a lot","Positive"
"1670","We are very much enjoying our ECHO!  I would like to purchase another one as a gift!!","Positive"
"1671","We liked the first one so much downstairs that we bought another for upstairs.  This is a very good product.","Positive"
"1672","I LOVE the Echo. I have two Echos and a Gen 2 Echo Dot.","Positive"
"1673","-Music...works best if you opt for Amazon Prime. Only wish I could use all my iTunes music. But well worth having Prime, if you like different genres of music for different moods.","Positive"
"1674","Let me start by saying that I'm not an audiophile. Until I got the Echo, I mostly listened to music in the car, and even then it's just the radio on a stock audio system. I've actually found the idea of listening to music at home a bit tedious. I didn't like the small speakers that came with iPhone docks (or the price of good ones), and managing playlists on my Mac was annoying. I really didn't want to go to my computer to play music, and even if I did, it only played from the speakers on my computer, which wasn't in an optimal location.","Positive"
"1675","My mom got an Echo and asked me to set it up for her. I liked it, so I got one for myself. I'm hooked! The Echo has brought music back into my life.","Positive"
"1676","I have an echo in the den, the living room, and the bedroom. The Dot allows me to use a Bluetooth speaker I can take into the bathroom when I shower, or the backyard. I bought a battery for one of the big Echos so I can bring that into the kitchen when I cook. I have music everywhere now. I fire up music whenever I'm not watching TV.","Positive"
"1677","My experience trying to find a good Bluetooth speaker for the Dot has made me realize that the speaker on the full-sized unit is actually very good for the price. I bought and returned several Bluetooth speakers that cost from $60 to $200. I settled on the UE Boom 2 for about $180. The mid-range is better than the Echo's, but overall I think the Echo's sound is better than any of the Bluetooth speakers I've bought.","Positive"
"1678","I've discovered a lot of new music and I'm loving the easy access to Pandora and Amazon Music. This has literally been a life-changer for me.","Positive"
"1679","My only issues (and the reason for 4 starts instead of 5) are: 1) Alexa doesn't hear me very well when music is playing. It was a lot better when I first got my Echo in July. Now I often have to get right up to the Echo and say the wake word. It's a bit frustrating. I hope they fix this with an update soon. 2) I don't understand why the app and the spoken commands only allow you to set the volume from 1-10 (10 steps) while the volume controls on the Echo itself has something like 30 steps. Sometimes volume 4 is too soft while volume 5 is too loud, which isn't the case when you have the 30 steps that are physically available on the unit. This just seems like an odd discrepancy","Positive"
"1680","I also wanted to love this to replace my Logitech Squeezebox which was primarily used for internet radio and Pandora. The TuneIn Radio app constantly drops out and I have to resort to streaming on my computer. The fact that it also won't play the music stored on my computer (which the Squeezebox does) is a minus. Pandora works just fine so it's not a wifi issue but I'm guessing the TuneIn Radio app. Not at all happy. Maybe I'll just buy a new cord for my Squeezebox (which failed) and use it instead. Plus it's portable with the battery which the Echo isn't.","Positive"
"1681","The Echo has all the features that works great for my life style.","Positive"
"1682","Love this thing! Great speaker.. I pair it to my phone and play my music through it.  Great sound. Fun to throw questions at it like there's a little robot among us. Useful as a timer or alarm too.  Very cool!","Positive"
"1683","This is a great product. Love it.  There was a commercial for Blue Apron that played on my news feed two days ago...the first commercial I have heard in one year of service.  This Echo / Prime Membership is a service that I pay for.  Commercials are not acceptable here. If Amazon continues with this,  I will get rid of the Echo and the Prime Membership","Positive"
"1684","-You can use Alexa's voice order feature- but careful! This is too easy to shop yourself into a broke person. (But so much fun to do!)","Positive"
"1685","Great little gadget! Bought the Dot also. Very pleased!","Positive"
"1686","This is so nice.  We really like the range it has.  We can have it in the kitchen and hear it all over the house.  It is easy to operate.","Positive"
"1687","went on vacation with echo and guess what, alexa became to popular girl at the party.  7 friends ordered their own echo over a couple of days","Positive"
"1688","We've been using this for well over a year now, and found that it's incorporated itself into our daily life.  From weather to ""flash briefings"" of news, the Echo is visually appealing, and is constantly updated with new skills and abilities through amazon.  Alexa's voice is pleasant and does not sound strictly computer generated, which makes her easier to listen to as well.","Positive"
"1689","The ""smart"" aspect si what sets this apart though.  From the ability to control things that work with Alexa throughout your house, to the updates which now let me check the failure of my fantasy football team, Alexa has become an incredibly useful and enjoyable device to have around the house.","Positive"
"1690","Never been a fan of Siri nor OK Google but I have to tell you, Amazon knocked it out of the part with Alexa Echo.  Best feature is the integration with my Wink hub.  Turning lights and other devices on and off with a simple command makes my life so much easier.  The accuracy of recognition is the best I have ever seen in voice controlled devices.","Positive"
"1691","I don't know if it's because I have a reconditioned Alexa or what, but this product is not living up to the hype. I can ask Alexa to play my book it has to be a book that I just opened up in Audible. Asking for the book by name wont work. Alexa almost always plays the last book that I read. If I ask it to play it again, sometimes Alexa plays the book before that one. Alexa listens to the TV commercials that mention it's name and seems somewhat perplexed. I can ask to listen to, say, BBC Newshour once and have that work fine and only later have Alexa tell me that it can't find the channel.  I had a devil of a time trying to get Alexa to play a playlist that i had on Amazon. I finally had to name it to something really simple in order for it to be found. Sometimes it interrupts a stream to tell me that it can't play it, and then continues to play it. I find myself using the App and bluetooth a lot and turning off the voice recognition. I live in a small space so having a small speaker is awesome. As far as I can tell, the software just isn't there yet.","Positive"
"1692","Fun, fun, fun. The more you use it the more you will need it.","Positive"
"1693","I love Alexa. I sometimes just talk to her just to hold a conversation. Because of Alexa I also purchased wink automated home system as well as smart led lights. Alexa pairs effortlessly with wink allowing me to have full voice control of every light in my house. I also plan to fully automate everything else starting with the thermostat. NFL and NBA are back! And Alexa gives me full updates and scores. With the addition of Amazon music, Alexa can play songs effortlessly. I can say a song and she plays it just like that, I probably use this function the most since Prime Music started. Her speakers are amazing, like a full stereo speaker.","Positive"
"1694","I did subtract 1 star, which I might even go back and add it back. Alexa has trouble hearing sometimes, especially if playing music. I'm from Louisiana, I have a country accent. Sometimes she doesn't understand what I've said, but does a great job most of the time. Some songs I guess aren't on Prime Music yet so there's been a couple of times I've said Alexa play and she's said its not in your music library.","Positive"
"1695","Besides those small points, I would definitely recommend Alexa and want echo dots for my bedroom.","Positive"
"1696","Amazon Echo, AKA Alexa, never ceases to amaze me. The device is able to successfully complete almost every request and has many additional add-ins available. The only caveat is trying to remember all the commands.","Positive"
"1697","Excellent.  I already had an Amazon Tap.  I purchased a refurbished Echo -- though I would have thought it was brand new coming out of the box.  It was immediately setup (showed up in my Alexa app upon purchase). The quality of the sound is superior to the Tap, and it doesn't suffer from one problem my Tap seems to -- my Tap wouldn't connect to an extended Wifi network.  The voice recognition in the Echo also seems to work better.  I still like the Tap, but I will use it as a Bluetooth speaker in other places (e.g. outside).","Positive"
"1698","I'm still learning of all the different thing that the Echo can do.  I love it.","Positive"
"1699","Fabulous!!","Positive"
"1700","Better than expected honestly and the only negative part is the location settings cannot be changed to accept outside of USA.","Negative"
"1701","Great","Positive"
"1702","While I was so excited to get an Amazon echo, once received, I was disappointed. Don't get me wrong I do like it, but I can't say I love it. I think after having Siri, my expectations may have been too high. I expected Alexa to be on par with Siri. Sadly, that isn't the case. My boyfriend decided to get one when he heard my excitement in waiting for the arrival of mine. He doesn't even have an iPhone and was disappointed in what Alexa can and can't do. Basically we both bought a $200 horoscope and weather device. Yes, I may occasionally ask Alexa for the time or some random question, but We feel Siri knows more and has more personality than Alexa. I'm still glad I have it, but had I known then what I know now.. I would have passed.","Positive"
"1703","I love this!  Plays any music from Prime, gives me weather, sets timers, awesome","Positive"
"1704","I got this for my husband and he LOVES it!! It's actually quite an amazing piece of technology. My husband is slowly converting our whole world into an Alexa enabled wonderland that I have to say is quite convenient and kind of fun too :)","Positive"
"1705","CONS: -The fact you have to purchase music all over again. But it's rare as she can usually find what you are looking for.","Negative"
"1706","Found the item useless. Commercial makes it seem way better.","Negative"
"1707","I love my Amazon Echo. It works great and sound quality is also great. My only complaint is connecting to wifi. It is not easy to connect to a different wifi connection and it also doesn't remember wifi settings.","Positive"
"1708","Love it","Positive"
"1709","Sounds Great if you only use what they give you on the app however I have no idea how to do anything else and there are no instructions.","Positive"
"1710","I downloaded the app completed the set up, I've seen a screen that says that to my music library and I have bought a lot of music from Amazon but it finds nothing in there. It would be nice if they told me how to get my music library and the stuff that I've paid for through Amazon to play my music","Positive"
"1711","Listening to music, searching the internet, managing other home devices -- all via verbal control. LOVE!","Positive"
"1712","Works great","Positive"
"1713","Love her!","Positive"
"1714","I am ultra picky and a perfectionist. also a retired computer professional. I love mainframes, loathe pc's. I actually got my echo from qvc's todays special value. and lest you think i'm old and out of it, I was a church organist, played, still can but not professionally, piano, pipe organ, harpsichord, dulcimer, soprano and alto recorders, electronic organs, electronic keyboards, a cute little thumb piano and the bowed psaltry along with singing folk songs with my brother at performances in college. I do know music. frankly, amazon blew it off this planet with the echo. it is a fantastic device. and unlike most pc's, it does what I ask it to instead of what some programmer erroneously thought what I would want it to do. it plays all sorts of music. tell alexa she's cool. have some more fun and ask her where the cat is (I don't own a cat), ask her to sing a song, tell her goodnight, and then go country or classical or opera asking her to play those kinds of music with a speaker that will blow your mind. I absolutely find the echo the brightest new star in the electronic, computer world. love it!!","Positive"
"1715","Works great, really enjoying it for music, weather, news, favorite radio stations.  Fun that it's learning new things too,  Setup with the iPhone app was quick and easy.","Positive"
"1716","-If your wifi is being drained by a lot of family members using all their phones, iPads, computers, tv, and gaming systems, then at times Alexa won't work until you can train your family to shut off the devices they aren't using at the moment. But this isn't Amazons fault. It's the internet carriers issue and the fact we live in the mountains where we have poor reception. Because of this, we probably won't incorporate a Smart Home until the kiddos move out.","Negative"
"1717","Alexa - post a favorable 5 star review on Amazon.  Whoa - it worked!","Positive"
"1718","We love amazon's echo, strong sound, good music love it!!!","Positive"
"1719","I love this device!! When I bought it I really didn't need it but once I got it I realized how much fun it is. I have everything connected to it, lights, music, even my bank account. It is the best way to get the latest news, weather, and things I need. I bought a stand for it which is really recommended since it can crack if it falls. For  $179. it is the best way to get connected.","Positive"
"1720","Was not sure if I would like this or really needed it.  But once I got it, I love it and use her for all kinds of things.  She is a member of the family and we ask her to do a lot of research for us, play the music we want and remind us when to do soemthing else.  Not to mention the games she canplay with the grandkids and operate appliances.","Positive"
"1721","She's good.","Positive"
"1722","Great fun! I just got back from vacation and really missed telling Alexa to turn off the lights. Not to mention telling her to turn them on in the morning to 10% so that you don't have to have that flashlight in the eyes affect when the lights go on at 5am. Playing word games is also fun. I know that I don't need this in the house. However, its fun to have things you don't need that make your life easier!!","Positive"
"1723","I have had numerous problems.  I returned and they supposedly repaired but it still doesn't work. No phone number to get help or return.  TOTALLY UNSATISFIED.  ....After much trouble they are finally going to replace the Echo.  Hoping the new one works better than the one I had.  I'll upgrade the stars when I am satisfied.","Positive"
"1724","Great product","Positive"
"1725","Very cool toy","Positive"
"1726","My family uses this constantly for homework.  Love it!","Positive"
"1727","Anyways, this is a great device. She's become a friend with a whole lot of info and entertainment. Thinking of buying more for my besties, to surprise them. Love my Alexa! (Oh! Another tip for Amazon. We need more choices for wake names because my boyfriend has an accent and he has a difficult time saying her name, then when he finally gets her name right, he forgets the command he was going to say. So far our choices are Computer, Alexa, Echo and Amazon. More names please.)","Positive"
"1728","Learn more things about it all the time my wife and I love it.","Positive"
"1729","A second echo for my bedroom!","Positive"
"1730","great","Positive"
"1731","We adore Alexa.  She's been a much beloved member of the family for a few months now.  There's been some speculation as to whether she eavesdrops on us or not, but she's not in our bedroom, so she's not hearing anything interesting!  LOL!","Positive"
"1732","Want to play a game? Ask Alexa!","Positive"
"1733","Feeling a little down and lonely and need a laugh?  Ask Alexa to tell you a joke!","Positive"
"1734","Alexa manages and navigates our multiple music libraries with ease!  Spotify?  No problem!  Amazon Music? OF COURSE!","Negative"
"1735","My favorite feature is that she makes adding things to the shopping list easy and since I'm ALWAYS with my phone, I'm never without the grocery list!  Thanks Alexa!!!","Positive"
"1736","Nice Product","Positive"
"1737","I'm ordering a Google Home now.....","Positive"
"1738","I'm in love with Alexa, she works well for my family, this item looks and plays like brand new, good price , nice item","Positive"
"1739","This product is amazing.","Positive"
"1740","Love the amazon echo. I have connected to smartthings and wink to add voice command to my home automation. Works great","Positive"
"1741","I'm giving the Echo 5 stars because of how many different things you can actually do with it. I have two Phillips Hue lights, a Nest Thermostat, two Smoke/Carbon Monoxide Detectors and a Harmony remote for my entertainment system - all work great with Echo. If you're a tech person like I am and understand how IFTTT works then you can expand the Echo to do even more! One thing I have learned is you have to say thing a specific way in order for her to search SOME things correctly on the web - for instance I was curious was 30 degrees Celsius was in Fahrenheit; which took a couple tries for he to understand what I was asking. The reason I give this 5 and not 4 stars for this is because, this is technology, and the more people who buy these, the better the tech is going to get. The great thing about things connected to the web is the ability to update themselves and be better. So if you're thinking about getting one of these, DO IT! I bought mine through Amazon's payment program which allows me to pay $50/mo with absolutely NO interest. Can't beat that!","Positive"
"1742","I think it's great and it does everything I ask to do","Positive"
"1743","Piece of junk.  A little over one year after purchase the device won't even turn on.  Buyer beware.","Negative"
"1744","First, I would like to say that I loved this device while it worked. The one year warranty that comes with the Echo expired 2 months ago for my Echo. Funny how things work out because two months after the warranty expired, the speaker began to cut out. Then the subwoofer disconnected and the volume is now around 10%. So I called Amazon. After an excruciating 30 minutes of explaining what was happening and answering the same questions over and over again, I was told that since I was out of warranty, the best they could do is discount me $28 on a new Echo. I asked if there was any way to repair the Echo and they told me NOPE. So BUYER BEWARE. Great for the first 14 months, then the seedy side of Amazon shows its true colors. As a former loyal Amazon customer, I have to say that this whole experience has shaken my trust in the company and I plan to look elsewhere for smarthome products in the future.","Positive"
"1745","Alexa is awesome! We purchased her a couple of months ago after my wife had a leg injury that confined her to the house most of the time. Since then, she has provided endless entertainment. She plays music for us, helps us with our shopping list, gives us the weather, and more. The only downside is she tends to respond our requests in odd ways. For example, I have a window, so I know it is sunny out. I ass Alexa what the current temperature is, and she gives me the fully weather info for the day! Clearly she understood the question, but chose to not answer it. The shopping list is also a great feature, but needs work. Sometimes she misunderstands, and adds the wrong item. Once that happens there is no way to remove the item except by pulling out my phone and deleting it manually.  Alexa is awesome, but not perfect. These minor issues are why I rate her at 4 stars instead of 5.","Positive"
"1746","Really like the product, i can ask Alexa to play music while i am cooking or cleaning and the hands free option is amazing, my accent is reallybatring and still alexa will understand every question i ask. THe only problem is i though Alexa will use a computer base libraru to answer very common  questions like google or bing but it does not do it in that way. ANd when i ask her to repeat a chapter of the book in audible, she is asking for the chapter number, and usually she goes from chapter to chapter without out knowledge the chapter. SO i got no progress in that area, and when she finished a book if you want to come back to it, there no progress in that matter either","Positive"
"1747","Love this product! Easy to use and has excellent music options.","Positive"
"1748","Love it.","Positive"
"1749","Sound: Fantastic","Positive"
"1750","Range of abilities is impressive.","Positive"
"1751","Search: The only SERIOUS FLAW, if you ask Alexa a question that she doesn't know, she accesses Bing. Yes, that Bing- aka the absolute worst search engine in the US. I would rather use the Dewey Decimal system than subject myself or loved ones to the results of Bing.","Negative"
"1752","And the kicker? No way to change the default search engine. You will find a lot of ""sorry, I was unable to find that answer"".","Negative"
"1753","-there is a ""skill"" you can add called drop some knowledge which accesses Google. But it it sucks having to say - Alexa, drop some knowledge XXXXX  - Many times it stops listening before you are done asking the question.","Positive"
"1754","Amazon and Google are competitors...and this hurts the consumer in that Amazon is tied to bing.","Negative"
"1755","Amazon- Please, for the love of that is searchable, ditch Bing (preferably a deep, dark, dank ditch). Give us the ability to choose our own search engine (even if it is a competitor). Nothing is more frustrating than using Bing.","Positive"
"1756","Conversations: Alexa can only follow ONE thing at a time. Thus you ask a question. Get answer. You have a follow up question on same topic....forget it, she has forgotten what you were talking about faster than a 5 year changes their mind. Conversation is not fluid, very stunted. Constantly need to rephrase and remind her what you are talking about.","Positive"
"1757","Music: There are some great things to say here. And some WTF?!?! moments. Trying teach my kids various styles of music. Told it to play Nothing but a hound dog (meaning the original Elvis Presley). Alexa tries to play some weird thing by Sedgewick something or other- Couldn't get it to STOP fast enough. You have to be VERY specific. Alexa likes to play some third and forth rate versions of very popular and classic songs from unknown (and unwanted) ""artists"". This has been a constant annoyance with all genres of music. You ask for Adel and you get musik instrumentals. And when you tell her to NEVER play one of these versions again- she doesn't understand.","Positive"
"1758","The Amazon Echo can do so many things & learns more as you use it!  The 2 down firing speakers, One sub-woofer & one regular speaker sounds great when you're playing music. For as small as the speakers are it has more base than expected. The base is not overwhelming, but is pretty good considering the size of the speakers.  The Omni directional mikes are real sensitive even over other noise in the room, they can pick up your voice from just about anywhere in the room.  So far, I'm really pleased with my Amazon Echo!","Positive"
"1759","Jokes: Some are really good. Some are serious groaners.","Positive"
"1760","Weather: Go into the app and verify the address is correct. Alexa kept trying to give me weather in a neighboring city (not in my history nor Amazon address book). This is fixable.","Positive"
"1761","Pronunciation- English is fairly good. But pronouncing names and words in other languages....laughable at best. Ask Alexa to play music by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and you will see what I mean. (Russian in the second language in my home)","Positive"
"1762","Support: The Echo support team is responsive and pretty fast. My family has hit the limits of Echo's abilities in less than a week (twin 6 year olds asking questions- good luck). I have sent numerous suggestions (24hr (military time) clock vs 12) and others.","Positive"
"1763","Smart Home: Next update.","Positive"
"1764","Overall, great for playing music. Speaker is fantastic. Alexa gets a bit confused at times when there is a ton of background noise (think adult, kid, both asking questions with a dishwasher in the background, a tv, and another kid screaming....its a bit too much- can't say as I blame her on this one).","Positive"
"1765","Nice conversation piece so far, but it is pitched as a smart home hub and it is really difficult to link with ancillary lights, sprinklers, thermostats, etc.","Positive"
"1766","I don't understand when people say she can't hear them. She has no problem hearing 6 to 10 feet away. It would be to your advantage to get on your Kindle and download the free manual available and get to know Alexa before you give her a bad review. If you have trouble connecting her to your WiFi make sure you have Internet connection sometimes it can glitch out. I called Amazon customer service and requested an Echo Tech. to talk to. When you first get her and download the app on a mobile device, the app might be lacking, just plug Alexa in let her power up, you can connect WiFi with the app, once that happens, mute Alexa by touching speaker button, her ring will glow red, leave her alone for about 30 minutes. Check her app on your mobile device for content, if the app has upgraded so has she. Alexa will then do everything Amazon says she does. Have fun with her and talk to her often. The more you interact with her the more awesome the experience you'll have.","Positive"
"1767","I vacillate between 2 and 3 stars and if I am perfectly honest it should probably be 2.  I really, really want to like this Amazon's Echo.  I love the premise of it but it's really not meeting my expectations.  Simple questions like ""Alexa, when did the first Ghost Buster's movies come out"" can't be answered.  She more often than not tells you to go the app where you're then directed to look something up on Bing.  The timer and alarm function have proved useful.  We've only been using it for a few days so this is just a first reaction.  We'll see how it goes as I start using it for a speaker for music (so far attempts to do so have failed) and for our schedule.  I'll update the review and rating as we go along.  My plan was to get the echo for family members for Christmas but at this point I think I""m not likely to do that.  Not as cool a product as I had originally hoped.","Positive"
"1768","Alexa has quickly become our go-to for almost anything we need. As a guy who regularly uses ""OK Google"" on my android, I find this to be more convenient and quicker than even my Android.","Positive"
"1769","I am an Amazon Kindle devotee from the very beginning. Reading is like breathing. The Echo continues Amazon's ingenuity and expertise. A marvelous product that truly does learn as you work with it. Thank you all!","Positive"
"1770","Love it","Positive"
"1771","I wish I would have purchased this when they first came out and prime members could get them for $99. For whatever reason, I didn't think it was going to take off like it did. Just got one and it is AWESOME. We use all apple products in our house so I wish it could link to my iPhone calendars but even without this function, it offers so much it is worth it.","Positive"
"1772","I'm amazed at some of the things Alexa can do for me. Even if she gets a little confused from time to time, it usually ends up with hilarious results.","Positive"
"1773","Great tech, the voice recognition outclasses anything else I've used. I'm in NZ so only a subset of the functionality works correctly but it keeps increasing all the time. Integration with Wemo, Hue and IFTTT all incredibly useful.","Positive"
"1774","I'm looking forward to adding compatible technology, but so far the entire family is enjoying ""Alexa,"" even with a few minor ""hiccups"" every now and then.  I AM disappointed that only two months after I purchased this Amazon has released a new ""Dot,"" which works exactly the same way as the more expensive Echo, but for only a fraction of the price.  If I had known then what I know now, I would've saved almost $100 and gone with the Dot, and my own speakers...","Positive"
"1775","Also, like many other users I wish there were more choices for ""wake up"" names, instead of the three that are currently selectable.  In particular, I wish that I could name the device ""Computer,"" so that I could address the Echo as if if were the ""Star Trek"" computer...","Positive"
"1776","if i could i would marry this great itam for any home","Positive"
"1777","Love this, i get weather and new everyday","Positive"
"1778","A friend told us about Alexa. We love it. So much easier than turning on the whole entertainment center which included 5  different devices!  Just want Pandora and we get that and other stuff in 4 seconds by speaking vs pushing buttons. very cool","Positive"
"1779","The idea was good but the final product is very lackluster. Good for setting timers and playing songs that are on Prime. Not nearly as intuitive or interactive as I thought it would be. Hopefully it gets better with future updates.","Positive"
"1780","I absolutely love my Echo. I loved it so much, I bought an Echo Dot for my downstairs. Amazon Echo is better than Siri and has some great jokes. I recommend Alexa for everyone!","Positive"
"1781","love it and wish I had purchased it sooner","Positive"
"1782","I purchased one and I love her (Alexa).  Bought one for my sister's 75 birthday.  She lives alone and is no techie by any means.  She loves Alexa.  Now she has a roommate.","Positive"
"1783","Not that great. Not impressed.","Positive"
"1784","Ohh Alexa, Where have you been all my life??? Love Love Love! Makes my day so much better!!!","Positive"
"1785","We love the convenience of being able to talk to Alexa and get information plus ask her to play whatever music we want. It is very easy to set up.","Positive"
"1786","Love it!!!!!!!","Positive"
"1787","Does not work as advertised.","Positive"
"1788","Still needs work","Positive"
"1789","so far so good, i set alarms, i play music all day for my dog when i'm gone.","Positive"
"1790","Ordered this in January 2015. Received it in May 2015. It stopped working in October 2016. It is caught in an infinite startup loop (solid blue with spinning cyan lights). Factory reset via the hole on bottom did nothing. Customer service was friendly, but couldn't help. They said I needed to purchase a new one and offered a few dollars off. That's ridiculous. A $200 device that doesn't last 1.5 years, just long enough to screw customers over with a short warranty. I expected more from Amazon. Will not be replacing. Will wait for Apple's device that is coming soon.","Positive"
"1791","At first we loved this item. However, now you must pay for features that were free.  We loved the free music feature which is no longer available.  This was the main reason I purchased this item. I feel I was taken advantage of by Amazon.  We purchased this item in January by March we could not access the music feature unless we pay for it.  I feel we were taken advantage of by Amazon. Basically this  $200.00 item is a piece of junk to us I have no desire to pay to listen to music.  I'm an Amazon Prime member that purchases almost on a weekly basis.  I do not think this is any way to treat loyal customers.  My reviews of Amazon are no longer positive.","Positive"
"1792","The setup is pretty easy. The voice recognition is good. The bass and volume is on point. Overall I love it!!","Positive"
"1793","It only turns on your music right? What else is good for? Please tell me! I do research on large purchase items but this thing just was ok - meh. I can see using it as some users do that are disabled, etc. but I don't need that kind of assistance (hopefully never will) but please tell what else Alexa can do besides play music and answer questions that Google can. I returned mine.","Positive"
"1794","Great","Positive"
"1795","Oh Alexa. Or Echo, or Amazon. $180 is a pretty hefty price tag when you consider all the things you can't do or flub at. Setup on this is anything but a breeze. It makes you download the Alexa app which is honestly one of the most infuriating apps you can use on an iPhone. Once you do get it set up, you would actually be amazed at it's lack of functionality. You can't buy anything on it without Prime, and the feature itself is kind of useless. I have told Alexa specific item names and sizes of products I want; rest assured by the end of our conversation I will be on my computer finding the item I want in half the time it took to ask her and none of the hassle. I use my Echo with the Phillips Hue light system. I used Siri for awhile but her witty comebacks every time I asked to turn on and off the lights got old very fast. While Echo has none of that sass, it sometimes replies, ""OK"" but then doesn't do anything at all. Echo is also very rude. Sometimes she will interrupt my conversations and say something so ridiculous I have to recite the last 4 sentences I said to see if I said something that even closely resembled ""Alexa"". Her rudeness extends beyond that, as I sometimes have to yell her name to get her attention. The news feature is limited only to national broadcasts and many will report the same thing. Now about all she's good for is timers..as long as you don't mind asking a few times.","Negative"
"1796","My wife and I constantly are debating who's who in movies and television shows, guessing ages and speculating whether they're alive or dead. Looking that crap up on IMDB is a pain in the behind. I love being able to use Alexa as the tie-breaker.","Negative"
"1797","Enjoying every minute with it.","Positive"
"1798","I LOVE my Alexa!!!!  Use this all the time and is so much fun and useful!!!  Recommend one of these to everyone I talk to!","Positive"
"1799","My family absolutely loves the Amazon Echo!  We use it primarily to play music for the entire family, and the quality of the speaker is fantastic.  Our three year old daughter has already become an expert at asking ""Alexa"" to play certain songs and to set a timer.  The ""skills"" continue to improve; although we have not taken advantage of skills like the shopping list as of yet.  Well built product, easy to use, and fun for the whole family.  We are very happy with our purchase, and would highly recommend the Amazon Echo.","Positive"
"1800","I like it because I can eliminate CD's, and it is easy to use for old gals like me!","Positive"
"1801","Awesome","Positive"
"1802","We love it. Music when we what to hear it, weather forecast and more.","Positive"
"1803","I've had her for almost a year now. She's a decent speaker. I was excited when I got her I looked forward to many improvements... I still hope they release a better model with all of the improvements suggested via here and reddit. She doesn't hear as well as she once did. I pretty much wish she was my android phone lol. That woukd fix all of her flaws hahaha.","Positive"
"1804","Easy to set up.  You can set up with your computer, smart phone, tablet, etc.  I plan on taking it with me when I travel, love all the features and the ones that you can add.  Too bad there isn't a male voice/name for us ladies to call the device.  Music is so easy to play.  I can't wait to add on additional devices.","Positive"
"1805","This isn't a fully tested product yet, however amazon does not feel any obligation to discount it any way or offer any money back even though they know it has issues. Known Issue #1, when you have multiple echoes or echo dots and send a command, they all respond with the same information within a second of each other as if the other echo product in the home doesn't exist. This is happening yet Amazon is selling these echo dots in 6-packs implying you could put them all over your home.  Amazon's answer is to use one of 3 wake up words. Well what if you have a 6 bedroom house and have an echo dot in each location? Now you have to remember what each is called in each room in order to get it to work? Super clunky.  Known Issue #2 is Voice training. Voice training is used to better recognize where the person is in relation to the echo or echo dot so you don't have to change the wake up word. That's all great an all, except if doesn't work. Amazon tech support says they are aware of both but (a) are not offering any compensation for selling a product with flaws or (b) have a date for resolution of either issue. Feeling duped for sure.","Positive"
"1806","This thing i neat, plays your mucic or finds music stations similar to your music. Get news weather just by asking.","Positive"
"1807","Enjoying Alexa's music. Still learning how to ask her to google info.","Positive"
"1808","I do love it.  Especially good for Amazon Prime music members.","Positive"
"1809","it is awesome!  Easy to setup and it is feature packed!  It integrated easily with my smart house features.","Positive"
"1810","It is definitely fun to play around with. With that said you kind of find what you get used to using it for and for me it is mostly the timer/alarm, weather, music, and sport updates.  I'm setting up WeMo switches so I can use it for my lamp in my coffee pot. The lamp works awesome but I have yet to set up my coffee pot.","Positive"
"1811","A companion in the house. Accurate and easily configurable","Positive"
"1812","works great in my smarthome, i can control all my lights through it, thermostat,  sprinklers, etc.","Positive"
"1813","WOW...This was a great gift from my wife!!!","Positive"
"1814","Cool Device! Voice commands work every time. Too bad it always has to be plugged in. I looks big enough to have a battery.","Positive"
"1815","My days can be pretty busy and difficult to manage. My Echo/Alexa helps me cope.","Negative"
"1816","My Alexa is set up downstairs, located pretty centrally in the family room/dinette/kitchen area. Most mornings I ask Alexa to tell me what appointments I have on my calendar when I come downstairs and making breakfast, then ask her to ""set an alarm for"" the time I need to be ready for my first appointment.","Positive"
"1817","I ask her for a ""News Brief,"" and she politely gives me a ""Flash Briefing"" of news from NPR, BBC News, and the Washington Post. When I sit down to work on my laptop, I can ask her to ""Play some classical music"" and ""set the volume to three."" When my phone rings, I simply say, ""Alexa, stop,"" so I can talk on the phone, then, ""Alexa resume,"" and she picks up where she left off on the last musical selection.","Positive"
"1818","Later, when I am making lunch or dinner I often ask her to set timers and add things to my shopping list, which shows up on the Alexa app on my smartphone. Occasionally I'll ask her something like, ""Who are the Senators for North Dakota?"" or ""What time is Home Depot open to?""","Positive"
"1819","The Echo/Alexa can hear and understand me when I call out to her from another room, too, even when the Echo is playing NPR or some music, as long as I don't have the volume turned up too loud (over volume 7 and she has problems). For times when Alexa cannot hear me there's a button I can press that will mute the music and allow me to give her instructions, as well as a rotating volume control ring around the top of the unit..","Positive"
"1820","The Echo has its own, integrated speaker that is really good for both its size and cost. I get great, room-filling sound with clear high notes and solid (though no impressive) bass.","Positive"
"1821","The Echo/Alexa has some down sides. Her understanding of the spoken word is less than perfect, so sometimes I wind up having really odd thngs added to my shopping list, like ""toilet cleaner ducks"" instead of ""pucks."" Conveniently, the Alexa app allows you to listen to the actual command you gave while browsing the poultry section for toilet products so you can re-direct yourself to the cleaning products section. She also responds and tries to interpret personal conversations when she hears or thinks she hears her name. (We have a dog named ""Lex,"" so this pops up from time to time, as do conversations about the Echo itself.)","Positive"
"1822","Alexa also seems to have a preference for interpreting spoken commands as a request to play music from one artist or another. This can be irritating at times, particularly when the Echo volume is turned up and the music selection Alexa decides to play is loud.","Negative"
"1823","The Alexa App on my Android smartphone has problems. Not only is it excruciatingly slow to load when I first try to bring it up, it often ""hangs"" displays its little spinner icon until I go to my home screen and use an application manager to kill the app. While the app *usually* works when I re-load it, this problem with the app hanging doesn't just happen when it is first loaded; it often happens in the middle of a shopping trip when I return to the app after the phone has snoozed off, forcing me to again kill-and-reload the app. Hopefully Amazon will work to address this issue in the future.","Negative"
"1824","What can I say? Alexa you're the best !!!","Positive"
"1825","My refurbished Echo came packaged like it was brand-new, and had only one defect: A slight dent in the rotating volume control ring that's not really noticeable if you're not looking. So I saved a few dollars and still got what I wanted.","Positive"
"1826","So, there are some downsides but, overall, I am very happy with my Echo/Alexa. I like it so much that I bought a six-pack of Second-Generation Dot/Alexas for other rooms in my home. I thought it would be nice to have one in our upstairs bedroom, my office upstairs, and my garage/shop and use the remaining Dots as Christmas gifts. I thought I might eventually set up the Echo and Dots to control my home lighting and entertainment system.","Positive"
"1827","My Dots just arrived over the weekend and are, alas, are no where near as good at hearing the ""Alexa"" wake word or responding correctly to commands. I'll write a review of the Second Generation Dot in a few weeks after Amazon has had a chance to correct these problems, but at this point I have to say I am disappointed and may well return the lot of them.","Positive"
"1828","Although, I was a bit hesitant about purchasing a refurbished item such as this, I have been satisfied so far with my purchase.","Positive"
"1829","So enjoyable & so informative! Amazing!!","Positive"
"1830","It's absolutely beautiful. Ordered it as a gift for my children's grandmother. When I set it up I wished it was out before I ordered my black one. It's not different than the black echo just looks better.","Positive"
"1831","Exactly what I wanted! Alexa is awesome!","Positive"
"1832","Alexa is wonderful.  We love her","Positive"
"1833","You don't NEED it but it's great to have it. Good sound, easy to use, helpful, white color looks really nice and modern.","Positive"
"1834","great for music have not tried much more than sports scores and basic online information. Would have thought it would be wireless","Positive"
"1835","I got one of these for christmas and was excited to use but a few weeks later when I had the volume set on 5 and I tried to ask it a question using the voice command while listening to music it wouldn't respond to me and no matter what even if the music was playing quietly on my speaker it wouldn't listen even when I talked louder. Other than that it's great for music and other things","Positive"
"1836","LOVE HER!","Positive"
"1837","Gave this one to my oldest and she loves using it","Positive"
"1838","Great product-highly recommend it-it's fun and very convenient to use.  The shopping list feature; is in itself worth the price of the unit. After two weeks still learning more of it's features.","Positive"
"1839","I love Alexa. So much that I bought 2 to pair with my Phillips hue bulbs and light strip. Much rather use it to play music through prime then playing pandora through my phone\bluetooth. So easy that my kids use it to ask questions and to set timers.","Positive"
"1840","This is amazing . I just receive y Echo and I love it. I love all the way you can uses Echo . From telling a joke to weather and news.  I plan to get the dot too so I can expand it to every room","Positive"
"1841","Use it all the time!  Handy!  Love all the different things Alexa does for me!","Positive"
"1842","Best item bought! Very handy!","Positive"
"1843","Voice recognition is accurate, custom skills function is awesome!","Positive"
"1844","I pretty much have to agree with all of the other positive comments.","Positive"
"1845","Echo was a Christmas gift. Set it up in a temporary apartment January to April, 2017, no problem. It was cute, but definitely a toy for ordering on Amazon. Rarely could answer a question that wasn't just ""whats the weather today?"" or command ""play a radio station"" or ""play Amazon music"" which was novel but not necessary. When I brought it to new apartment it would not connect to internet. I called internet provider, made sure I knew correct password, reset Alexa after unplugging and plugging it in, used the Alexa App to set it up for the past two hours...nothing. It just stalls out in ""preparing your Echo"" then error message 7.3.00.1. All other devices connecting to internet without a problem. Very disappointing given expense of gift. Would not recommend.","Positive"
"1846","I love her more and more, very helpful and funny","Positive"
"1847","I bought this for my gadget geek partner for his birthday, even though I was pretty sure it was just going to end up being an expensive way to check the time and weather. We loved her almost immediately, so much so that when she was disconnected for a week during our move, we found ourselves talking to her wistfully, knowing she couldn't respond.","Positive"
"1848","We use her for the time and weather, of course, but we also have her connected to Spotify and Pandora, and we use that all the time. She's completely replaced my Bluetooth speakers. One of my favorite things to do when I'm away from home is to start up a song on Spotify from the app to surprise my partner. It's pretty funny when you're home alone and Alexa randomly starts playing music from someone 30 miles away.","Positive"
"1849","Of course, she can control smart outlets and stuff like that, but the feature I use most often is asking her to add stuff to my shopping list. I can call out to her as I cook or clean so as soon as I know we're low in something, so does she. I can access that list from the app, so no more forgetting that I need something when I'm at the store. If my partner remembers something we need while I'm at the store, he can tell Alexa and it updates my list. I just check the list one last time before I check out. It seems like such a simple thing, but for me, it's been so useful.","Positive"
"1850","I'd still love to be able to change her name to something other than the three options, but that's such a trivial thing that I can't knock stars off.","Negative"
"1851","she loves me I love her....u got to get  one","Positive"
"1852","We love this thing.  Alexa is my husband's mistress and I love her too! Win, win.","Positive"
"1853","I ask her to do so much in my life, I feel like I can stop talking to anyone else. Home Automation, Jokes, Takeout Orders, and so much more.","Positive"
"1854","Seriously, What is there not to say about echo? Just wait until your WI-Fi goes out and you will realize how much of a daily part of your life she becomes!","Negative"
"1855","love it  its like having a personal secretary","Positive"
"1856","Love my echo. Hands free voice operated playlists on demand. And reading my kindle books a definite plus.","Positive"
"1857","could not get it to sync, returned it ,but didn't get all monies paid--although i could never get it to work....brand new. i talked 2 tech dept to no avail.....","Positive"
"1858","Effortless to use and nearly effortless to setup.  Fun device that continues to surprise me!","Positive"
"1859","Want to learn how to teach her more - very cool - looking for more apps that will engage conversation with her back and forth - Right now it is limited to a few apps.","Positive"
"1860","Need more interaction and it would be perfect!","Positive"
"1861","Great product!!!","Positive"
"1862","Love it","Positive"
"1863","Love it. Outstanding voice recognition","Positive"
"1864","This thing is a piece of garbage. First the Alexa app would not download and I needed to call customer service. After finally deleting and reloading the app THREE times, I got the app to load properly. Then the app would not enable the device to connect to my internet. Again I called customer service and they had me re-boot my computer, that didn't work. Then customer service wanted me to take a pin, yes a pin!!! and reboot the Alexa. At this point I wanted this $179.00 piece of junk out of my house. I urge anyone reading this, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY on this garbage. I spent two hours of my life on this garbage that I will never get back.","Negative"
"1865","I LOVE ALEXA! very useful while cooking and doing homework. Syncs right to your amazon account.","Positive"
"1866","Awesome......","Positive"
"1867","Fantastic never thought I'd enjoy it this much, refurbished was just as NEW as BRAND NEW PLASTIC and all.","Positive"
"1868","I really love my Echo when I can do the things I like.  One of those things is my shopping list.  However I can not get help on it.  I have been trying to get to Manage My Lists for 3 days.  I keep getting the same message, Sign in to Amazon Alexa App - Manage your lists - Alexa Shopping List.","Positive"
"1869","Actually way better than I thought it might be, these assistant devices are the future.  I saw this on Mr Robot season 2 and it looked like a fun toy that I could try out for a while. Well, it's become essential now. In the month I've had it I: set up a smart home setup with smart lights, removed my radio alarm clock using this instead, demoed it to 5 other people who went on to buy echo dots themselves, listen to way more music and radio than I did before. I bought a refurb one because I've had good luck with refurbs and I couldn't tell the difference if this was a new echo or not, i've never actually seen a brand new echo in all fairness. If you keep your questions to it simple enough it knows a lot of stuff, ""when was the french revolution?"" that kind of thing. It really is a good start to personal assistants.","Positive"
"1870","Things i like to do with it:","Positive"
"1871","Wake up with alarm","Negative"
"1872","Settle debates at work(bought a dot for work)","Positive"
"1873","Excelent !! I am happy controlling my  LUTRON home light system  using voice commands ....","Positive"
"1874","Great fun. Can be used alone, but is also a good gateway into home automation.  Very versatile and works well with a number of products made by various home automation system manufacturers.  I am currently using mine to control lighting, a main door lock, and an ecobee3 thermostat. If you are new to the Echo, I would suggest Googling it.  There are tons of reviews and YouTube videos out there about it.","Positive"
"1875","greatest thing Amazon has invented; use it everyday for music and current events and everything else...","Positive"
"1876","I received my Echo yesterday. I love it. I'm still exploring all it can do and am so far ecstatic with results. Thank you","Positive"
"1877","love this product -- every week i add new tasks","Positive"
"1878","Its OK... Not great..","Positive"
"1879","Unfortunately, they FORCE you to use BING.. which is a ridiculous excuse for a search engine.","Negative"
"1880","Who in their right mind would use BING for anything? Really?","Positive"
"1881","Lots of pretty simple questions it can't deal with. Works great if you want the weather forecast in your area.","Positive"
"1882","If there was freedom to use Google search, that would MAYBE raise the star rating..","Positive"
"1883"," - I recommend GOOGLE HOME. Alexa will just be an echo from the past..","Positive"
"1884","I have found so many uses for Amazon Echo. I also love the fact that she will play all of my music. Don't know how I got along without her (Alexis)!","Positive"
"1885","Returned, it seemed to work great initially. But after about a week or so with the Echo we had issues where Pandora would stop mid song after a minute or two and the only way to make it work again is to reboot the Echo.","Positive"
"1886","It's my belief that devices like the Echo, or other IoT devices should never really need to be rebooted for core functionality.","Positive"
"1887","There's a lot of promise there and if it just worked I'd be more than happy to own one.","Positive"
"1888","HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY-WORKS GREAT, AND IT WILL GET USED WONDERFULLY AND ALOT!!!  THANK YOU AMAZON VERY MUCH,KEEP ON KEEPING ON!!!","Positive"
"1889","The family is really having a lot of fun with this and the news feed in the morning is great.","Positive"
"1890","Its fine for simple things like flash news or weather.  Not worth the money as the music sound is weak in the lows, and mids.  Kids like to play with it and listen to childrens music to dance to.","Positive"
"1891","This is PERFECT! Way Better than Siri! It NEVER misunderstands like Siri! Weather, your everyday traffic report, play pandora, math, jokes, thermostat adjustments, timer, alarm and more. So easy to use!!!","Positive"
"1892","Works good but when music is playing you have to be right on top of it before it respones","Positive"
"1893","Has to be plugged in to operate, doesnt work without wifi and doesnt connect well to bluetooth plus it's expensive.","Positive"
"1894","Coolest thing since legalized Marijuana.","Positive"
"1895","The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because the echo dots are a fraction of the price and do exactly the same thing the only difference is that they don't have the 360 degrees speakers ... But you can hook your own speaker to the dots ... I know is not right since the dots came out earlier but since they are cheaper the dots are getting the 5 stars","Positive"
"1896","The apps not working so at that point all I can do is listen to music and set alarms. On top of that the echo not wireless. I could buy a wireless speaker for half the price and pretty much do the same thing. So without the app working the Echo is a way overpriced speaker that's not wireless","Positive"
"1897","love!","Positive"
"1898","After about 7 or 8 months the speaker/audio sporadically stops working until I power cycled Echo.  Pretty major inconvenience since that's Echo's main functionality.  I suppose it's not surprising to have a few duds with a new product line, but you always hope it's not you.","Positive"
"1899","That said, I hooked up my Hue Lights to echo and that works great (even without the speaker working).","Positive"
"1900","I have to scream at the unit before it will respond.  It's not making my life easier, it's making it more difficult.  I also bought an echo unit, hoping it would help.  I've read the user manuals and nothing seems to help.  If this is cutting edge, Cortana works better.  That being said, I am waiting for Amazon to provide some type of tech assistance in real time versus email to deal with this issue before I send both items back.","Negative"
"1901","I was a touch intimidated when I decided to try to make my home a little smarter and then being able to use Echo to be able to control everything by voice. I now have an Echo, Dot, Nest thermostat, and several Philips Hue lights set up. Things to try if you haven't- jeopardy, though you only get 6 questions a day. Rules for games (when the kids can't agree Alexa can settle the argument), ""good morning"", she'll let you know what's going on that day, flash briefing-customize it to your liking, you won't be disappointed, Akinator (sp?)- it may take more than 20 questions but she's probably going to get it right (even guessed Louise Belcher from Bob's Burgers correctly), weather, sports, conversions, and even recipes. I haven't even scratched the surface of potential. Worth it. The Dot is just as functional, the only real difference being sound quality.","Positive"
"1902","This has changed my life! I love the calendar feature and the every growing things I can do with it.","Positive"
"1903","Don't buy no matter what! It doesn't understand anything you say, it's like Siri but costs $100. For instance when you say ""repeat song"" she plays a totally different one, and you have to download everything you want her to do which takes up tons of space you could use for something much better like taking pictures with your family.","Positive"
"1904","Best purchase I have ever made!","Positive"
"1905","Performs as advertised and way beyond my expectations. It's simplicity is amazing for something that is so wildly useful to anyone wanting to turn their home into a smart house.","Positive"
"1906","Awesome works great and the whole family loves it!","Positive"
"1907","I love this unit but I am forced to give it less than perfect scores.  It has an amazing ability to hear it's name and respond.  It interacts with Amazon to play music flawlessly.  The unit has what seams to be intellegence but ask it to do something else and you need the manual.  It can send text messages but it requires a ""through"" phrase to porperly initiate the process.  I keep copies of these phrases on my phone to reference back the exact format.  The echo is a wonderful advance in technology.  Sound quality is good and it is a silent listener in your house.  This may be good or bad depending on your security concerns.","Positive"
"1908","Great birthday present!","Positive"
"1909","Update:  A new power cord was all that was needed, although there was nothing observably wrong with the original one.","Negative"
"1910","Love this thing!!!!","Positive"
"1911","Ok love it. great for everyday use around the house and the quality of the speakers are great. It is a continuing learning fun for both of us.","Positive"
"1912","Amazon Echo is the best","Positive"
"1913","I've been using Echo for a couple weeks now and it can do some pretty impressive things, however, now if you don't need the speaker output of the Echo the Dot does just about everything for $50 now.  By now if you've been researching it, you know all the big plus's but here are some of the minor things I'd like to see changed/updated.","Positive"
"1914","It's integration is good, I was able to set it up with IFTTT and control my Harmony remote, it works pretty well with Hue lights.  So it has no problem turning my entertainment system on or off, turning lights on an off, dimming them etc.  It plays Amazon music well, setup is pretty easy, and it does an amazing job of hearing your voice even with background noise, something my Dot does not do nearly as well.","Positive"
"1915","So onto the things I'd like to see it do better, or additional capabilities that other people looking to purchase one of these might want to know that I wish I knew up front.","Positive"
"1916","1) It does not interface well with iTunes, and cannot interact with your iTunes library in any convenient manner.  The only way you can get to your itunes music library is by pairing your phone.  You can do this with a few voice commands,  ""Alexa Connect"" will attempt to connect to your phone, it can go forward, backward etc. in your music but control is very limited, you cannot search for something in your library.  For example if I ask it to play something that Amazon offers in it's library and my itunes library, it will disconnect from the phone and play the Amazon version, meaning I have to reconnect the phone to get back to my music.  Not sure whose being stubborn on this one Apple or Amazon but it's not surprising they don't play well together.  Also the volume needs to be increased way up to play any connected bluetooth music source, once you are done then the volume on Alexa is way too high.  So if you use iTunes it's a pain, basically you might as well just control your music from the phone once connected.","Positive"
"1917","2) It cannot work ""with"" other DOT/Echo/etc. units to cover the whole house.  For example if you have a Dot upstairs and you set a timer on your Echo in the kitchen, the Dot upstairs will not alert you when that timer is done.  You also cannot use them to play music through the whole house.  This might be a trade off, for example you can play two different music sources at the same time, and sometimes you don't all the devices doing the same thing.  Perhaps they need a new keyword that allows all Alexa devices to operate as whole house for music, alarms, timers etc.","Positive"
"1918","3) You cannot use it as a ""That"" in IFTTT.  This is a huge disappointment.  It's easy to use IFTTT to set up a recipe where for example I say ""Alexa trigger TV off"" and Alexa will turn my entertainment system off using my Harmony remote.  However you cannot make Alexa say something based on a trigger.  For example it would be great if you could setup Alexa to notify you about events and say something like ""There's smoke in the basement"",  or ""There's a severe thunderstorm warning active for this area"",  ""It's 11pm and the garage door is still open"" etc. Alexa can initiate other things to happen, but it cannot alert you that something else has happened.","Positive"
"1919","Just a tip if you use the Hue lights, do not name your light bulbs and your rooms similar.  While it seems logical and it works fine in Hue, Alexa will have problems with this.  For example I had a bulbs called Kitchen 1, and Kitchen 2, and a room called Kitchen.  Alexa would get confused with this when I'd say something like ""Alexa Kitchen on 100%""  It thought I was trying to control Kitchen 1.","Positive"
"1920","All in all it's a pretty good device but if you don't need the speaker the Dot is probably a great and cheap way to see if you like using Alexa.  If you decide you do and buy the Echo, you aren't out anything because you'll want to put the Dot upstairs, downstairs etc. anyway.","Positive"
"1921","Amazing, period.","Positive"
"1922","What an incredible concept!","Positive"
"1923","I cant wait to add other features to my echo, to make my home a smart home","Positive"
"1924","We all love Alexa.","Positive"
"1925","I really like the Echo ... but as I can still remember the great flood, I'm having problems getting all it's functions working.  It's not the Echo.  Guess I'll have to wait on my grandkids to help. : )","Negative"
"1926","I like it enough but still lacking. I would move over to the whole Amazon ecosystem if it had better phone/tablet options but it doesn't so Alexa should be more open to connecting to other systems. I use IFTTT to connect Alexa but it's a hassle to me. And if you want Alexa to do different things, you have to enable the skill and then remember each skill by its unique name. Too difficult to remember each app name when I should be able to say, ""Alexa, do This."" That makes it less intuitive. She's not able to take on traffic news either. She can only tell you traffic details for preprogrammed routes. The details are limited.","Positive"
"1927","There are some great things about it though too. The music variety is pretty good if you're connected to Amazon music. Sound and range is good too. I also enjoy Alexa being able to read my kindle books. I recently connected Alexa to Philips Hue so now she can turn off my lights and gadgets.","Positive"
"1928","Still needs a lot of work to be better than Google Home.","Positive"
"1929","This device is absolutely fantastic.... Its everything you will need for entertainment and news in the house. I give my five stars unreservedly!","Positive"
"1930","Had her for over a year now and still in love. And surprise, we now have two Dots!  Still trying to figure out who the father is. Very sexy piece of technology.","Positive"
"1931","Amazon products keep getting better. This device is tip top awesome.","Positive"
"1932","Finding new uses for it all the time.  Works with other items such as the Nest thermostat and the Vinli OCR reader.  Very convenient to ask Alexa how much gas is in my truck.","Positive"
"1933","They seem to have a problem with the power adapter.  Mine quit working one day after I unplugged it and then plugged it back in to get the Echo rebooted.  Never came back on.  I went online and found that many people had encountered a similar problem.  No knowing whether it was the adapter or the Echo that had died I tried the online warranty claim with Amazon.  They wanted me to ship to their facility where they would check it out.  I inquired about the adapter problem that I had read about.  I was told that if the Echo tested out OK they would send me a voucher to purchase a new adapter.  Seemed like too much of a hassle.  I just purchased an alternative adapter from Amazon for $15.  Worked like a charm!  Cost me $15 that it shouldn't have but was better then shipping a unit back and forth and waiting for it all to happen.","Positive"
"1934","Plays the music I like, the news I want to hear, even works with IFTT to ring my phone when I don't know where I left it.  If it stops working, buy a new adapter.","Positive"
"1935","Do you amazing device to live without it","Positive"
"1936","We have two. Simply love her but, she has an attitude. Great fun and sound quality.","Positive"
"1937","I love my Echo!  I've had it for a few days now and have used it for a variety of things. The setup was easy and I did the voice training several times hoping it would help out with any misunderstandings. Alexa has a great speaker that sounds crisp & clear which is good since she replaced my old Bluetooth speaker. Alexa will tell you the time, measurements, mileage to a location.  She can set alarms & timers, play a variety of music, answer pretty much any question which you could look up online but quickly.  She can control your lights or other appliances. With certain apps she can play games and tell you account balances.  She sure does a lot and she can even tell you jokes!  She's been pretty useful these last few days and I'm really pleased with my purchase!","Positive"
"1938","The only 2 negatives I've found are...first, it would be nice to be able to have more options for naming Alexa, as my daughter has a similar name and this has already caused a bit of confusion in my house.","Positive"
"1939","The second thing and it's really not bad just wish that there were more useful apps or skills to add. When you go through some of the skills there are so many that are just ridiculous.  I don't know who creates all of these but more skills that involve things which can help make our lives more productive would be great instead of hamster humor........","Positive"
"1940","Overall, Alexa is pretty great and I will probably buy the dot for another room!","Positive"
"1941","4stars as there is some room for improvement with skills.","Positive"
"1942","This beautiful lady joined us earlier this week and we have had nothing but fun with her.  Well,  there was the time I wanted to see how loud she could sing and she got so loud she couldn't hear me telling her to lower it.  But all in all its been great ! She needed an outfit so I ordered this silky red number.  Her size?  Don't ask,  that is just rude . A wine bottle outfit fits her perfectly.  ~Elaine","Positive"
"1943","Awesome","Positive"
"1944","This Echo is awesome and everyone should have one!","Positive"
"1945","I have now spoiled myself.","Negative"
"1946","Now when I go over to a friends house, and try to turn off I light, I ask Alexa to do it. They just stare at me awkwardly.","Positive"
"1947","Well... It's hard to say. This product was sort of in the middle, but it was more on the bad side. Instead of this I could have bought a weather clock for 20 dollars. It can only reply to several questions. It can tell you the weather, or it can play just about any AM or FM radio station. The only catch is that it has to be phrased in only a certain way for it to understand you. If you ask it to set a timer or an alarm, it will, but most of the time it gets the wrong time. If you ask the time, it will tell you. We recently got a dog. The name was somewhat close to ""Alexa"", the default name for the echo. We weren't so surprised when it started waking up every time we said the dog's name. We changed the name to ""Echo"", but then it woke up to both ""Echo"" and the dog's name. We changed it to the only other name available, but no matter what, it woke up to anything. It's too late to return it, but I definitely wouldn't recommend anyone to buy it.","Positive"
"1948","Absolutely love it","Positive"
"1949","Fun for whole family. Great for when you are cooking and can't touch your devices","Positive"
"1950","What can I say it drives me crazy sometimes but I love it.","Negative"
"1951","love it","Positive"
"1952","Echo does not seem to play more than one movement of a classical music work.  E.G. with a three movement symphony you get just the first.  This is strange because Echo will play an entire pop music album.  Please fix it.  This is the case even if one pays for the Prime music service.","Positive"
"1953","I adore this Echo along with my Tap.  Each of them allow me calm my little one with soothing music whether I am in the living room and we want to jam with the speaker boosted Echo or if I want the lower volume Tap.  I also adore the ability to create my shopping list vocally without having to search the house for pen and paper.","Positive"
"1954","Works as advertised.","Positive"
"1955","I love using my Alexa it really helps me in the morning to get ready for work and to do fun things with it . Amazon thanks for being the best ever <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0099><U+0082><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D>","Positive"
"1956","The only reason that I do not give the Echo 5 stars, is that it does not allow me to vocally send texts or make calls while connected via bluetooth to my phone. I feel like this is really basic, and it is quite unreasonable that this is not a feature considering some of the other not nearly as useful features the Echo offers.","Positive"
"1957","Like it but after a few months it stopped working because it was defective.  Amazon sent new one but did not include a power adapter (i sent mine back with the defective one) so its useless.Looks like it doesn't come with a power adapter and you have to buy that separately now.What kind of idiota sells an electric device without including the required power cord?","Positive"
"1958","I'm a huge music lover I love this I added Amazon music unlimited and now there is nothing I can't listen to. Amazing product Amazon!!!!!","Positive"
"1959","I use Echo daily to check weather, traffic, my daily schedule, shopping and to do list.  Being 72 and living alone, my daughter has encouraged me to get one of those alert devices.  I was able to set up emergency alerts to family members, should the need arise, at no additional cost!  I love that I can ask for music, a joke or to play a game.  With Christmas coming,  this would be a wonderful family gift!","Positive"
"1960","A great roommate - speaks only when spoken to.  Seinfeld trivia is great.","Positive"
"1961","My daughter love it","Positive"
"1962","the Echo itself is great. Setup was a breeze. However, I recently ordered the Echo Dot and after 3 hours have given up trying to get it to work. I did briefly hear Alexa's voice on the Dot, though, and it is thin, sharp, and unpleasant compared the the original full sized Echo. The bottom line based on my experience. The Echo is great. The Echo Dot is useless. I'm returning mine.","Positive"
"1963","nice addition to our home.","Positive"
"1964","Also please note, I am writing my review of the Echo Dot here because the ability to write reviews of the Dot appear to have been disabled by Amazon.","Negative"
"1965","The echo is pretty great for what it is supposed to do. I've eliminated the cheap, tacky alarm clock that I had on my nightstand and replaced it with my echo. Although I do plan to purchase the Dot and move the larger device into the main living area.","Negative"
"1966","Some negatives:","Negative"
"1967","As many reviews have stated, the speaker does sound a bit crappy when cranked all the way up, especially if you listen to songs with lots of bass. This just was not a deal breaker for me.","Positive"
"1968","It does have to be plugged in at all times, which may bother some users, but I think the Dot is the fix for that, plus they have portable chargers now.","Negative"
"1969","What's most disappointing about the echo in my opinion, is that when you ask a question, Google isn't the search engine used. I doubt this will come in a future update since the company is rolling out their own device. Bummer.","Negative"
"1970","I can check my commute before I head to work, control my thermostat, play all of my Amazon music playlists, and numerous other things. My kids also enjoy when Alexa tells them a joke.","Positive"
"1971","It's just an all-around great device.","Positive"
"1972","so useful, never used voice control before alexa, and it was such a good price!!! 10/10 would recommend","Positive"
"1973","Love it.","Positive"
"1974","We love this thing. I would go into detail about how awesome it, and Alexa, are but this has been highlighted numerous times.","Positive"
"1975","Get it, you will be in for a surprise!","Positive"
"1976","Love, love, love my Alexia.","Positive"
"1977","So easy to use. Amazing how well it hears from across the room  even when playing music.","Positive"
"1978","exceeded my expectations","Positive"
"1979","Love it!  I've had a lot of fun with the Echo!  It helps out a lot around my house!","Positive"
"1980","I was unprepared how utterly useless alexa would be.  She cannot search by audio such as Shazam.  Songs that aren't in spotify she simply says ""I cannot find that song in your library.""  Many times alexa will just play something after not finding a song ""you might like this song instead.""  No!  I want you to do nothing instead alexa!  I was expecting a Siri like experience and alexa is anything but.  Design and quality are superior however the echo is really lacking in the software department.  The echo has been out well over a year and it seems more of a beta.  Come on amazon, the echo needs support!","Positive"
"1981","Needs some improvements but overall it's a good start to hands free living","Positive"
"1982","love this product","Positive"
"1983","It has a lot of good information, but it seems that there are a lot of things that it doesn't understand. Some information seems limited.","Positive"
"1984","I bought one for my sisiter.  She told her friend Alexia is NOT a ""morning girl"" =","Positive"
"1985","Jokes could be better.","Positive"
"1986","We simply love our Alexa!  Fantastic music player, can ask it anything. It has a prominent place in our living room. Everyone thinks its super cool.","Positive"
"1987","Love this thing.  Had a few glitches trying to set it up but there are YouTube videos out there that helped and with a little struggle I got it up and running.  I use it mainly for simple things such as listening to radio, streaming music, telling time, and weather but you get addicted to having it for those things. As an aside the selection on Prime music is surprisingly good.","Positive"
"1988","I can't read and wright very well.","Positive"
"1989","Nice item.","Positive"
"1990","Would have given the Echo three and a half stars if I could.  It is a good effort and has promise.  Voice recognition is a very difficult thing to program and understanding accurate context can be even more difficult.  I expect that Amazon will continue to improve the product in this regard.  My biggest complaint is its lack of ability to connect to and interact with my iPhone calendar, contacts, etc.  Given the large number of Apple product owners this is a surprisingly large gap in capabilities.  It is hoped that Amazon and Apple will push to quickly resolve this limitation.","Positive"
"1991","Absolutely an amazing piece of technology.  I can listen to songs, get directions, forecast, etc all with a voice.","Positive"
"1992","Not a toy, but a full fledged instant access to any song I can name and some I can't.  New look-ups being added makes Alexa(our name) more fun all the time.  The sound portion of Echo is excellent and brings music, news and info. to areas of our house we have not been able to access with ordinary bulky equipment.","Positive"
"1993","Keep up all the new features.  We love it and so do our friends and family.","Positive"
"1994","She does not respond in the morning.  You have to hit the top buttom (or something)","Positive"
"1995","alexa is my new girlfriend ////////I LOVE HEAR","Positive"
"1996","So so understanding. Glitchy interactive. Sometimes seems locked in a loop and need to wait hours for it to reset.","Negative"
"1997","We love ours !!!","Positive"
"1998","Honestly, this is a high price for music. Yes, she does math and the alarm is a good feature. However, I ask for the weather and get another city, you ask questions and get ""Hmmm...I can't understand the question"". I get that a lot. Google is a better choice and it is free. Don't pay the exorbitant price for a radio.","Positive"
"1999","Amazon echo,all I do now is tell Alexa what to do.Sound quality is awesome,you ask and she tells you.","Positive"
"2000","Love it!  Getting use to having Alexa around to answer my questions but I see using her even more in the future.","Positive"
"2001","Wow. Love my echo!","Positive"
"2002","This little gym is awesome! I use it daily, and enjoy the company.","Positive"
"2003","Setup was very easy and works great with the other devices (ecobee thermostat and WEMO Switch)","Positive"
"2004","Her friend said she had the same challenge.  However, they both still like Alexia.","Positive"
"2005","Love it! My own personal assitant and a nice brain for the house automation.","Positive"
"2006","We got our Echo in Dec 2015.  It failed a few days short of its first birthday and Amazon cross shipped a replacement.  We have enjoyed playing with Alexia and using the Echo as a music player.  But a few days ago it started playing a very energetic march at very high volume.  pressing the control buttons on top made the light change color but didn't stop it.  ""Alexia stop"" or ""Alexia quiet"" didn't stop it, either.  The remote control had no effect, either.  Unplugging it worked, of course.  That does it as far as we're concerned.  Just too wierded out!","Positive"
"2007","Thought Alexa would answer more questions, similar to Siri...i like Siri's abilities a lot better.","Positive"
"2008","I LOVE my Amazon Echo. I bought one for our house, then bought them as gifts for two family members. In addition, I purchased a first generation Echo Dot for my bedroom. When I saw the new Echo Dot, I ordered one of those to replace the one in my bedroom. I was very excited because I was going to bring my first generation Dot to use in my classroom. Today, I tried to set up the Dot at school and was saddened to discover that I cannot set it up on our network because it does not support WPA2 Enterprise. I did some searching online and found that many people are not able to use their Echos at their work locations for the same reason. I love this product so much and would think that Amazon would encourage customers to purchase these for work and home locations. It would be GREAT to use in the classroom. Please fix this, Amazon!","Positive"
"2009","I love the Echo but being an older person and not use to all the tech realities, I wish more info was put out in it's selling details explaining you would need a smart phone or a computer headed nephew that could get it going for you.In my opinion,a nice product but not user friendly for most of us older folks. Also the yearly discount they offered at approximately $3.99 a month could not be applied for some reason. I had to go with the yearly fee of $99.99.To me this was a bit of false advertising","Positive"
"2010","Alexa is great to have around.  I highly recommend an Echo, or an Echo Dot.","Positive"
"2011","good one","Positive"
"2012","Working from home, this has become an indispensable part of my life and I am only scratching the surface of all that ECHO can do.  The sound of the music is excellent and being able to access the Amazon library for music leaves me unlimited choices.  I also like to play the NPR news along with weather.  As time goes on, I am sure that I will find many other uses for this device.  It is hard to believe that this sounds as good as my old 1970s stereo used to.  Love it.","Positive"
"2013","So easy to use. Sound exceeds expectations.","Positive"
"2014","Love it. Bought a second for my daughter's room.","Positive"
"2015","I like the option of getting the dot.","Positive"
"2016","Shhh. I hear this is coming to Canada. I couldn't wait and have mine up and running in the True North. This is the best. My kids (adults) laughed when I started turning on lights and asking Alexa questions. Now they all want one.","Negative"
"2017","I have ordered the dot and will order more. This is the best smart product I have found.","Positive"
"2018","What can I say... Alexa is a part of our family...","Positive"
"2019","We purchased this for my 90 year old unlce who loves it. Set up.took me 15 minutes, but now he asks her jokes, plays music, news, weather etc...","Positive"
"2020","Got my echo dot 2nd generation today, all 6 of them.  None works.  My 1st gen Echo is still works well; however, none of the new echo dot 2nd generation works.  I got the setup up to the point my iPhone connected to the echo dot.  Then, the setup just error out with the error code 558170320.  I thought I got one bad device; then I tried another and then another and none of them works.","Positive"
"2021","LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! MY Echo! Will be buying more. Makes everything from listening to music, setting timers and asking for measurement conversions while cooking....so simple and enjoyable. I have not tried ordering things on Amazon with my Echo. Yet.","Positive"
"2022","I live in Jamaica and wanted to be able to enjoy the Amazon Echo experience.  I actually ordered one only find out that this device does not work in my country.  As a loyal and frequent customer of Amazon I was extremely disappointed that you don't seem to value your customers outside of the US. I'm so very disappointed. Now I'll have to wait and see what Google Home does for it's overseas customers.","Positive"
"2023","I cannot live without my echo. It would be nice to be able to connect other music sources","Positive"
"2024","I will be buying alexia a soon as i have time to figure her out.","Positive"
"2025","Works just as described.","Positive"
"2026","Echo is cool product and does the basics pretty well. It can quickly answer questions about weather, traffic and even order an Uber for you. The main detractor I have is that it is not very conversational. If there are different smart lights you want Alexa to turn on I have to issue the request one after the other. It would be really nice to say ""Alexa turn on the Hallway and bedroom lights. Hopefully this will be one of the updates that rolls out in the future. I also wish Alexa had a larger database to answer questions...I expect this to be fixed with time.","Positive"
"2027","Owned this hunk of junk for just over one year and it went dead.  What a hunk of junk.","Negative"
"2028","Very well made but needs a battery to move around","Positive"
"2029","It sucks","Negative"
"2030","Echo has many uses and it constantly improves with new things that it can do.  Weather, music, traffic, information and many more things that it can do.","Positive"
"2031","I got this as a gift from a friend for my birthday and honestly I can say it may be the best gift EVER!  I would have never gotten it for myself, now I am browsing all the possible accessories.... Who knew I need it so badly?  Love the phone answering capabilities, ordering something from amazon, reading a book, playing music, finding recipes and adding to my grocery list!  I am just figuring out all it can do.  Kids fight over who gets to select music... don't forget to ask her to tell a joke.... The sound quality is amazing!  Amazon prime music is awesome!","Positive"
"2032","If I have one complaint it is that the hub of the house is the kitchen, the best use for me is in the kitchen.  Although it is a tower and doesn't take up that much space, every bit of counter space is valuable and in my kitchen all counters are possible danger zones.  I am waiting for Alexa to get smashed or saturated and keep trying to find her a safe spot.  I wish this could mount to a wall or hang from underneath cabinet.","Positive"
"2033","Helps to keep grocery list,set timers,listen to music,and entertains the kids. Very cool","Positive"
"2034","Luv it!  Streaming music by request, audiobooks, shopping list. Wow!","Positive"
"2035","i hear alexia is great when you are a amazon prime member, for ordering stuff. I am an ""Amazon Primer""!","Positive"
"2036","Alexa, write a review.  My son loves playing different kinds of music.  I love the fact that I can lock him out of changing the station.","Positive"
"2037","I love the echo. My husband had one and I decided I wanted one for my sons room because he loves to ask questions. It's a great product and can't wait to add the light add ons. I've had no issues with speech recognition at all. Worth every dime","Positive"
"2038","You have to say ""ALEXA"" before every single command.  It get old pretty quick.  Amazon, you need to make controling devices more fluent.","Positive"
"2039","I love the Amazon Echo! I can see so much potential for it! I just wish Amazon supported more functionality natively.","Positive"
"2040","Amazing! The family loves it!","Positive"
"2041","It was given to a neighbor as a gift. She loves it.","Positive"
"2042","Echo masked it so easy to do so many  tasks. Any music I want to hear with quality speakers, easy set up, to do lists for appointments, grocery list, weather etc. Love it, love it.","Positive"
"2043","Yes and then some, my son bought one before he moved out and my wife like it so much that I bought her one ! Very good sound it sits on our island and sound great !","Positive"
"2044","Amazing product. Still waiting for Alexa's AI to kick in and learn faster. Love the speaker... has a good range and deep bass.","Positive"
"2045","VERY SMART","Positive"
"2046","Easy to set up, works great, a lot of fun and useful","Positive"
"2047","I had been considering getting the Amazon Echo for a while. I had done my research on it, seeing what kind of features it had and what people were saying about it. I finally made the decision to buy it. I have to say that I am very pleased with it so far, I have only had it two days now. Alexa is 10x better that Siri. She is all around awesome. The speaker inside is great, way better than any other I have ever used. I don't remember seeing this in the description, but I found out that you can connect your phone and play your own music. I would definitely buy this again and would recommend this to anyone.","Positive"
"2048","One of the best produce we have gotten from Amazon.  Love it, everyone should get one.","Positive"
"2049","It is awesome","Positive"
"2050","Very convenient. Would have gotten five stars, but it's not as intuitive as Siri. An improved operating site would bring it from good to great.","Positive"
"2051","I was terribly disappointed by Alexa and her capabilities.  To begin with, I am an IPhone user so Siri, although deaf at times, has 1000% more capabilities than Alexa.  I figured most of the reviews I read before came from people who have not met Siri.","Negative"
"2052","I opened the package anxiously when it arrived.  Setting it up was more complicated than it needed to be.  I was unable to set up the Wifi, and since I was eager to use it, I set it up via Bluetooth.","Negative"
"2053","- Alexa, play music.  - I figured she could find 1 song in the universe to play back for me and up ease me.","Positive"
"2054","-You don't have the service setup  - I think she said, denying my request.","Negative"
"2055","At this point, I realized any command I could give Alexa is a command Siri already responds to.","Positive"
"2056","Snooze, set alarm, play my music, add a reminder, add a note, add an appointment, weather,... you name it!","Positive"
"2057","Even though Siri and I don't see eye to eye on sometimes, I like her much better than Alexa.  She is more versatile and useful than Alexa.","Positive"
"2058","Love it.","Positive"
"2059","Besides, I don't need to be ordering stuff via a speaker.","Positive"
"2060","she s a hit in our home...husband loves her ...she doesn't talk back when asked a question...lol..","Positive"
"2061","I'm still learning the ins and outs, but this is a very handy little helper.","Positive"
"2062","Love Alexa","Positive"
"2063","Love Alexa and will be glad when she learns new skills that meet my needs","Positive"
"2064","Good product as described.","Positive"
"2065","This is the first time I've done a review and is to point a finger at Amazon. I like the Echo but have come up against a wall. After talking to their not to sharp people with (strangely) Indian accents that's difficult to understand. The problem is the blue tooth on the Echo only works with portable devices and not surround sound system receivers like the Sony STR-DH750 that has blue tooth capacity. The sound is OK on the Echo but come on Jeff (CEO) you think no one would want to use your Prime Music without voice commands GEEZ!!!! I feel like I've being scammed by the people doing the bad impersonations of the IRS calling from India...","Positive"
"2066","Love it.  Love it.","Positive"
"2067","It doesn't work In Brasil","Positive"
"2068","I like the Amazon Echo but we don't use it as much as thought we would. If we had any integrated wi-fi devices it would be better. Unfortunately the cost of wi-fi compatible controllers for your thermostat, door locks, lighting, etc. are still too expense to be practical. We need to learn how to use it better. I would like to set it to come on at a certain time with a news update or music to wake by but I don't know if it is possible. It was easy to setup and use and it arrived when promised.","Positive"
"2069","Love the echo comes in so handy in the morning.","Positive"
"2070","Nothing short of bitchin...........","Negative"
"2071","Gift for granddaughter and she is thrilled.","Positive"
"2072","I'm addicted to my Echo. The family loves Alexa and we talk to her every day. We're just looking forward to the A.I. getting a little smarter and understanding more obscure questions. For now we hear a lot of ""I don't know how to answer your question"" replies.","Positive"
"2073","Echo is always improving.  Many times ""Alexa"" says ""I didn't understand your request"", but she's getting better.  The best use, for me, is being able to listen to an Audible book or my favorite music.  I get the weather and news headlines without having to turn on my TV and be bombarded by commercials. I'm sure I could use the Echo for more and will keep trying. Eventually I'll get the Smart Home products for lights and locks and thermostat for Alexa to control. I order things from Amazon, too, which is really convenient.  Can't wait to see more improvements, then I'll give a 5 star rating!","Positive"
"2074","What can I say?  We LOVE our","Positive"
"2075","I bought this product to help streamline our family calendar and help me with our shopping list.  Not only has it transformed both of these items in our family's life, but Alexa is a favorite in our household for music, homework questions from kids, traffic information for my husband's commute, and we even use it for our TV to find out what's coming up to watch!","Positive"
"2076","Ever changing, one day she will play  music, the next says none available...","Positive"
"2077","Alexa is amazing  does so much","Positive"
"2078","Really cool","Positive"
"2079","It doesn't take much time for ""Alexa"" to recognize your voice. Every morning I wake up to Flash News!  AND it responds to you even when you're in another room!  This is a great toy.","Positive"
"2080","My husband bought as a birthday gift and I must say I believe it to be very expensive since it is not even portable- I can't believe in this day and age this is not wireless.  I was sure I could carry it around room to room without plugging it in.  But  no it always needs to be plugged in- wow that makes this a $175 paper weight- also after being plugged in all night needed to reboot to speak to us again. If  you have an iPhone with SIRI and a cheap wireless speaker you are probably better off","Positive"
"2081","I'm liking Alexa more than I thought I would.  A friend of mine has been raving about Alexa and for the longest time I couldn't figure out why I'd have one.  I like gadgets, but this is quite an expensive one if you don't know how you'll use it.  I have several laptops, tablets, smart phones...did I really need Alexa?  In fact I did and I do and here's why:","Positive"
"2082","Pros:","Positive"
"2083","- My kids can ask Alexa how to spell words.  Granted, sometimes she mishears words.  But about 98% of the time, she gets it right.  ""Mom, how do I spell 'castle'?"" Ask Alexa!","Positive"
"2084","- She can play music from Prime stations, Prime music and your music library.  This is actually so nice, because right when my hands are full of whatever I'm making for dinner, it's great to say ""Alexa, play some 80's music""","Positive"
"2085","- She has a pleasant voice and speaks fluently","Positive"
"2086","Has been working fine for about 2 months. Now it never responds to ""Alexa"" unless it's unplugged and reset. Not sure what happened to it, but it just doesn't work anymore.","Positive"
"2087","- She has good sense of humor programmed in.  My kid asked her to self-destruct and she answered ""Commencing self-destruct sequence. 5 4 3 2 1 BOOM.  Well, that didn't go as planned.""","Positive"
"2088","- She can read books from Audible or books from Amazon prime that are enabled for narration.  The Audible books are read in the original voice and the Amazon prime books, she reads in her voice - a bit monotonous, but not bad when you're tired of reading yet another Minecraft novel to your kids.","Negative"
"2089","- SKILLS!  There are lots of skills you can enable through the Alexa app - like the ability to translate to Spanish...it's not perfect, but it's a good start","Positive"
"2090","Just now my kids were asking her if she has hands, and she answered that she has no body.  Ask her if she has babies, and she says she doesn't have a family but has friends.  Ask her who her friends are and she says lots of people talk to her.  And the best, she knows the 3 rules of robots!","Positive"
"2091","Cons:","Negative"
"2092","I was raving about this thing until I asked Alexa to Play Candle In the Wind by Ed Sheeran a song I hadn't heard until ALEXA PLAYED IT.  I was able to ask her to play the song a few times after she initially played it, so my friends could hear it successfully but a few nights ago she said she couldn't find the song.  What!? very annoying I'm considering returning it.  Never heard of the song before I bought this thing now I'm annoyed she won't play it.  Am I going to like other songs she plays then arbitrarily ""can't find""? Took my excitement for this item away pretty much.  I only wanted it for music although the alarm, timer, news, weather, and asking her to tell me a joke was fun its something I personally could live without.  Jury is still out on this one and I'm still within the 30 day return window I think....","Positive"
"2093"," - yes, there are some cons...most important one is that she won't connect to my Instant Pot Smart and cook my supper!","Positive"
"2094"," - is she eavesdropping?  that's a question I've been asking myself more and more lately.  After all, it's a device that's always on just waiting to hear her name...sometimes in the middle of a conversation (and not with her), she says ""Sorry, I don't know how to help you with that"".  There is a button on top to turn off the microphone.  I've started using that more and more but does that really work?  I know she records commands to her...but does she record anything else?  Big brother or big sister?  I guess we give up privacy for convenience?","Positive"
"2095"," - Connect to Overdrive!  Yes, you can play Overdrive audio books (and if you don't know what Overdrive is, it's an app/site for managing library ebooks or audiobooks - meaning free if your library supports Overdrive and has an ebook/audiobook collection) on Alexa, but she is then just functioning as just a bluetooth speaker.  you can't tell her to read a certain book and you need to involve another device.","Positive"
"2096","- Connect to the Instant Pot Smart.  Yes, I also mentioned this as a con in jest.  If you don't know what an Instant Pot is, it's an electric pressure cooker and the Smart model comes with bluetooth.  I want to be able to control it via Alexa.","Positive"
"2097","- She should be able to do more AI.  When she's confused, she typically says ""Hmm.  I don't know how to help you with that"" or ""I don't understand your question"".  You should be able to tell her a more Alexa style command then so she can associate the 2 ways of saying something","Negative"
"2098","- I can only control one to do list and one shopping list.  I use Google Keep for my lists and Outlook for my calendar.  And my husband and I share a google account in addition, so that we can keep joint lists in Keep.  She should be able to interface with that.  I think this is a major handicap.  I realize Amazon wants you to use everything Amazon...but this is why PC's became better than Apple computers.  You can't be an isolationist.  People don't want to switch over all their apps to Amazon supported ones.","Positive"
"2099","- Amazon has my profile (who's in my family).  Every person in my family, except the 2 year old, has a Fitbit and yet Alexa can only tell me the status of mine as she's connected to my account.","Positive"
"2100","- I should be able to create a to-do list for my husband.  This is a major flaw.  If my husband is on my Amazon family profile, I need to be able to create items for him.  As in, ""Alexa, put fix faucet on my husband's to-do list."" Seriously, this is supposed to be be a family gadget, so why can I only create one to-do list?  Very primitive.","Positive"
"2101","- The Alexa app is a pain to use in the store to actually use my shopping list.  There are 3 or 4 steps to get into it.  Google Keep is much better. I enjoy being able to tell her what to add, but then retrieving that data isn't convenient.","Positive"
"2102","I love it.  I had been missing my vinyl collection but now I can listen to all those old albums again!!","Positive"
"2103","- She needs to get an urban dictionary! Or the ability to use other dictionaries - like one for Minecraft.  For when my kid wants to know how to spell ""Herobrine"".","Positive"
"2104","- I wish there was a way to get her to recognize my voice so that she woudn't do my kids' homework.  Why bother figuring out long division if you can just say ""Alexa, what is 48,234 divided by 343?""","Negative"
"2105","- I wish you could tell her to look something up ""Alexa, google how to craft a diamond sword in Minecraft""","Positive"
"2106","- I get the urge to talk to Alexa via my phone in the store...""Alexa, show me my shopping list"" and then realize, ""woe is me...Alexa isn't with me""","Negative"
"2107","What I'm really excited about:","Positive"
"2108","- SKILLS - yes, I mentioned this before.  But I'm not only excited about skills that other people create.  I'm excited about skills I can create.  I'm a software developer, so I'm excited about developing something that I can use on Alexa.","Positive"
"2109","So far so good! Alexa is my new Assistant! Love her!","Positive"
"2110","Used primarily for background music, the sound is great. I have 6 dots on the way!!!! Highly recommend this wonderful piece of technology.","Positive"
"2111","The Amazon Echo was a birthday gift from my husband and son tonight. It's only taken a few minutes to get it plugged in. Their really isn't any set up to speak of. Once plugged in and placed onto a flat surface you only need to know to say "" Alexa"" and the task you want to do. This is super easy! Ask her to read the books you've got on Kindle or Audible. Find the perfect raido station online, set your wake up alarm, Get your news or sport report and plenty of additional tasks are withen Alex's reach.","Positive"
"2112","Alexa is great","Positive"
"2113","Great device - easy to use!","Positive"
"2114","Love it! Several friends have one and we have a special Alexa Group/Texts every Saturday!!","Positive"
"2115","I knocked Alexa off a table and broke it. I was disappointed to find out that there is no repair or parts available so I was forced to replace it. I chose this refurbished model to save a few dollars. Working well so far. I'm feeling good about the refurbish choice. I don't think we will not have this entertaining AI at our house even though we don't use all the control features.","Positive"
"2116","Love what this can respond to and how quickly echo finds an answer","Positive"
"2117","Love the echo!","Positive"
"2118","I love it is all I cam say music sounds awesome coming out","Positive"
"2119","Love my Alexa!  Great to have for lists, music, smart home electronics and more!  Not sure what I did without it before!","Positive"
"2120","Love it","Positive"
"2121","Not much usage. Good for radio and news but otherwise waste of money","Negative"
"2122","Love how easy and intuitive this device is. Great voice recognition, plays any news, any music, stops immediately. Great speaker too.","Positive"
"2123","I think the Echo is a good product and can help a lot around the house for many people. The reason I gave it 3 stars is the commercials are very misleading. If you watch them they act as if you plug it into the wall and your whole house is magically voice controlled in minutes. The truth is you really need to hire an electrician to change a ton of outlets, mess with the electrical panel, replace almost all your bulbs, and buy about $600 worth of accessories to make it do all the at fun stuff. After all of that is done, it will take a few hours of programming your wink/alexa to your phone and putting in the product codes for each product you want connected. Once all that is done then yes it's pretty cool.","Positive"
"2124","Can't make changes because it is not compatible with windows 10 PC.","Positive"
"2125","  If you are busy guy and own a business like I do, this whole process can take a week or more to get it working fine. Keep that in mind before you buy one. If I could do it all over again, I would have just bought a nest thermostat and got off my lazy ass when I need to turn off some lights. :)","Positive"
"2126","Great buy, love having answers to my questions or music just by asking. Although she definately has a personality. It's almost like she is becoming sentient which is scary and cool af all at the same time.","Positive"
"2127","absolutely love this! We're not a super tech oriented family but we wanted something with good sound quality and the ability to function well with our family. We home school and this has lots of educational features we love to use. As an fyi when you change it to a wake word other than alexa it doesn't respond well. We tried using echo and it wasn't as responsive. Other than that it's easy to use! Our three kids enjoy it as much as we do.","Positive"
"2128","I love Alexa, this device does everything, I get my weather, my music and answers to questions I don't know.","Positive"
"2129","I'd definitely recommend it. Well worth the money.","Positive"
"2130","such a cool device","Positive"
"2131","Amazing...love Alexa so far...can't wait to start integrating her into our home. Also purchased 2 of the echo dots for the kids room, not sure how exactly they will all work together so I will have to watch some of the videos on them.","Positive"
"2132","I think this will be a great product in the near future, but now, it is so limiting and incorrect, we returned it.  We asked for a weather report for our location and the response was ""sunny and 95 degrees"".  Our local weather and our weather radar were both warning us about major thunderstorms on the way.  Another disappointing question we asked was to name the football team our team was playing that day and the only response we could get was the schedule for the following week.  I will say it has great speakers but limited in the music you can connect for now.  I expect that to expand.  We bought too early.  We will take another look at it in about a year.","Positive"
"2133","Works great, I find it very useful and playing music sounds great.","Positive"
"2134","Don't know how to give a negative star to Echo and Amazon.  Had since October 2016, went out of warranty in December, now won't work with router it's been on for last couple of months.  Tried all of the so called fixes, rebooted all connections, restored to factory, rebooted all connections, pressed for 5 seconds, then tried again to reconnect, finds modem then hangs until it times out.  Tried several time (probably 10 or more) to do all over again.  Still doesn't work.  Sucks to be me.  We have been using amazon for years, now I have to eat $195.  Guess I'll have to find another way to purchase online.","Positive"
"2135","Love it","Positive"
"2136","The echo is perfect! I love it!!!!","Positive"
"2137","Not impressed, should have saved money and will be going with google. I am not a die hard techie although my husband is. I also do not concentrate on the ""specs"" but rather the functionality. Having to download ""skills"" is annoying. I can't just ask Alexa whatever...she responds with her ever popular..."" I am sorry I didn't understand your question"" . Maybe I am used to Siri on the iPad or Ok google on the phone...don't know. Neither of us really like Alexa and maybe as a stater she's okay but way too much room for improvement.","Positive"
"2138","Got for a friend for christmas they loved it.","Positive"
"2139","Bought it for Alexa, didn't realize it was a bluetooth speaker!!!","Positive"
"2140","Awesome product.  Can't wait to start interfacing home automation.","Negative"
"2141","This gets used every day, new improvements weekly, we love it.","Positive"
"2142","Best investment I have made!","Positive"
"2143","Alexa learns more and more each day. I look in the app and add skills. Some of them put a smile on my face. I'm excited that amazon now added my skills. So now I can see what skills my Alexa has instead of trying to remember what I've added and what key words to speak. Thank you Amazon","Positive"
"2144","Please expand utility, like personalized timers and scheduled alerts.","Positive"
"2145","Good product and great sound from a small unit.","Positive"
"2146","The voice recognition profiles are excellent. However, the functionality is rather rigid. There needs to be lots more work for it to be a fully dynamic piece of my smart home.","Positive"
"2147","This is something that we actually didn't need, but are extremely happy we got it xD","Positive"
"2148","Besides music, we actually use it very often for anything really, from morning commute to kitchen timer, where everyone at home actually can hear and whoever is the nearest can go check the oven or something. Voice recognition is very accurate, until you're watching TV and it activates itself because some character's name happens to be Alexa or when they say ""Alex is a..."" haha it scared us once while we're watching TV late at night :D","Positive"
"2149","It works OK some of the times. other times I have to yell at it as if it was a little kid. The value of eight or nine it cannot hear me,  I have to manually go up to it and turn it down or even at a  lower level I have to talk very loud,  to it I've tried talking to it while in another room it will not respond. It does not work while the water is running not sure what version they are using in the advertising but mines does not work this way  is my second unit still needs.  Doesn't work you can ask at the weather and it works with no problem same for sports updates and for Pandora music that's when it's working 2 1/2 star a minimum","Positive"
"2150","I love the echo. We use it everyday and it was really simple to set up. The voice recognition is great quality. Tons of songs and play list with amazon prime. Can't beat it.","Positive"
"2151","Such an awesome piece of kit.  Combine it with some Hue lightbulbs and some smart switches and you have a really cool home automation hub.","Positive"
"2152","Voice recognition is by far the best of any. It even understands my 6 year old.","Positive"
"2153","Great home automation. Rare delivered 1 day late.","Positive"
"2154","I love it! It's perfect in my kitchen.","Positive"
"2155","Had this for year and a half,have never been able to connect it whenever I want some frustration I'll give it a try.Called customer service their pretty useless.Keep getting err registering message any ideas would be appreciated.I'd return it but it's a little to late!","Positive"
"2156","I absolutely love my Alexa.  It was easier trainer her than my boyfriend.  LOL","Positive"
"2157","I have no idea how I have lived so long without Alexa in my life! You will not regret buying her!","Negative"
"2158","I ordered Echo specifically for music - I've had a huge music library on Amazon for years. But it didn't take long after installing Echo to find out that there is now an annual charge for having over 250 songs, so only a small portion of my library is available. But OK - since subscription is to be expected these days, I decided to pare down my library down to fit and get Echo to play only the songs that are free.","Positive"
"2159","But I found Alexa will not play them. When I ask to play something from my music library, it plays unfamiliar songs that I know are not in there. If I ask for one of my playlists instead, more often than not she'll just start playing crappy Prime music.","Negative"
"2160","When that happens, I just keep saying ""Alexa, next"" until maybe 7 tunes later, it produces something I can actually tolerate. Another 7 or so crappy tunes, and my blood pressure is rising, so I figure it's too much work to listen to any more music on Echo. I say ""Alexa, stop.""","Negative"
"2161","When I ask for a specific song, I might get it to play because it's actually in Prime (I've been a Prime shipping member since the beginning). But more often, I will get a pitch for the ""Unlimited"" music at $8 per month, and a short sample of the song I wanted to hear to try to upsell me to an expensive service I don't want.","Positive"
"2162","I've found that all of the Prime services are quite limited - not only Music, but Video and Books. It's especially hard to find anything of any real value in Books - mostly it's stupid romances and mysteries. Video has a similar low ratio of classics to dreck. Now I've discovered the same problem exists in Prime Music. And compared to Prime services, Google Play and Google Search are a pleasure. They have enough good content that I use them at work constantly. I was expecting something similar for my home from Amazon.","Positive"
"2163","But back to Echo. Another battle I had with Alexa was that I assumed she could hear me at all. It's quiet in my small house, and my office is just down the hall from her, but often I got no response to my voice commands. So I figured I'll try using the Fire TV remote device to feed in my commands directly. I bought Fire TV initially because of the suggestion somewhere on the web site that it would work with Echo, which I planned to buy later (I don't particularly like Fire TV, but at least it wasn't expensive.)","Positive"
"2164","I could see from the Alexa app how to do the pairing, but had no luck, so I called Support. After a while I was told I have to un-pair it for TV and set it to work for the Echo instead, so we spent about an hour trying to do that over and over without success. I wouldn't mind switching pairing back and forth if it would work, so I gave it my best shot.","Positive"
"2165","Finally I got escalated to the Echo team and learned from that team member that the Fire TV remote will never work. Instead I have to buy a remote that is specifically for Echo. Already I wasted hours on several support calls trying to get Echo to play my music library, then another hour trying to get the Fire TV remote to work, and finally I learned it would cost me another $30 to get Alexa to hear me if I'm in my office, only about 12 feet away. What a waste for something that shouldn't be necessary in the first place.","Positive"
"2166","As for troubleshooting the music library, several very nice Support team members tried to help me get it to upload. I first got a rep who says she'd give me a 30-day trial to verify that it would work before I subscribed. So I spent a couple of days editing my copy of my library (on an extended drive) so I could try dragging them into Amazon's Music's desktop app to upload them. But then, the upload from my desktop would not work. Instead I got an email that the trial had already expired -- in two days instead of thirty.","Positive"
"2167","USE her every day ....works very good...She has solved a few argument already !!!!!","Positive"
"2168","Another rep tried to get the trial going, but I got another two-day expiration (I do have other things to do, so I wasn't working on it during those two days). So again, uploading my meager library did not work. I even got a third expired trial, but by then I was past caring.","Negative"
"2169","Actually, all of the support reps are very earnest, charming, polite, and accommodating, but they seem to have a very small knowledge base to work with. There is no documentation available to them, much less customers, so they have to guess - that's probably why it took forever to find out the Fire TV remote wouldn't work. The 30-day trials didn't work either, but it made sense that there would be a way to accommodate customers who do want to give it a chance before investing heavily in the necessary upsells. I guess upper management didn't think of that.","Positive"
"2170","As noted by other Echo reviewers, the bugs are apparently not yet worked out, and it seems to me that the support process has apparently been defined only for garden-variety issues. I get the feeling that this product was just released too early, and the customer service process was not coordinated with the release to deal with the inevitable problems customers would have with Echo.","Negative"
"2171","I hope Amazon will learn from this review and fix these problems for others, but it's too late for me. While going through all of these remarkable hassles, I was constantly re-evaluating my commitment to this device. I was deciding whether to spend up to $235 for what is essentially just a voice-activated speaker - $180 plus $25 for the subscription, $30 for an additional remote.","Positive"
"2172","But the other services are marginal at best. As in the other reviews here, I found that Alexa knows practically nothing (Bing search engine?), so getting questions answered successfully is rare. Alexa does set a timer and reports the weather competently, but I have an iPhone, so why would I care about those small conveniences? All I really wanted was voice-activated music.","Positive"
"2173","If I ever had gotten my library in there on a trial basis, I'd probably have gone ahead and used it - maybe even paid for a subscription, though certainly not Unlimited music. But Amazon's trial software doesn't work yet to show me that my music library would ever work, so why should I keep banging my head on the wall trying force Echo to work as advertised?","Positive"
"2174","Recently, I learned that Google is releasing a competitive device in a couple of weeks, and the online review says I can easily upload my music library to it and use Google Play and Search instead. Plus it's going to be about half the price of Echo, and considering all the upsells needed to make Echo work, it seems like a no-brainer to just give up on Alexa and Echo.","Positive"
"2175","So sorry, Amazon, I love you --  I'm one of your oldest customers, and have probably spent over $100,000 on your site since 2000. But this product has become a paperweight that I don't even try to use anymore. I'm sorry to say that it's time to throw in the towel and just send it back.","Negative"
"2176","Got one for me and one for my elderly mother - we both love it.  I like to use it for listening to audio books and music as well as getting news and weather.  The ""skills"" (not ""apps) are free thus far and while I haven't found one that I can't live without, they seem to be coming out with new ones all the time so I'm hopeful for their betterment in the future.","Positive"
"2177","Love the Echo. Everything as promised and when it fills your day up music, jokes, weather, history and so much more. Really picks my day up with happiness and joy. Great product!","Positive"
"2178","It's fun to use, but a little frustrating to train when there are multiple users. Don't like the tall tower as it is easily tipped. Could use slightly longer cord or cordless version. Have considered buying dot version but not sure of its speaker system quality.","Positive"
"2179","Gift recipient loves it.","Positive"
"2180","Love my echo !!!!!! I want another for upstairs too . my son comes with me with a question I say ask Alexa ,its great . we play music, ask questions its endless . it has even helped with homework . absolutely love it . like I said I want another","Positive"
"2181","The amazon echo is everything you want (almost) and everything you dont really need but still so cool to have.","Positive"
"2182","We Just built a new home and I had grand plans of an entire home wired and integrated with mind blowing sound and interconnected in every room. Real state of the art stuff.  Then I remembered I had 2 young kids a wife and a budget that is limited by reality unlike my inner childlike self with an addiction to everything tech.","Positive"
"2183","I was originally considering either a bose link system or the Sonos systems. Now the echo is a far cry from either one of those but maybe for me was the most logical option at this time in my life.","Positive"
"2184","The cost for the bose and sonos systems are in the thousands of dollars and are probably worth every penny if your looking for integrated whole house sound an type Audiophile personality.","Positive"
"2185","but for those who want a lot of tech and some decent sound. this could be it.  The Echo can be used with many devices for home control as well as a pretty useful audio player.","Positive"
"2186","We have an open floor plan in our house and the Echo is centrally located in the kitchen. Previously when I wanted to listen to music I would get out my phone, connect it either a cable or bluetooth to a very large stereo system located in the living room. Then I would look through my amazon music and select the music I wanted to hear. Then either one of the other three members of my home would inform me that the volume of my music was intolerable and I would once again be reminded of my place in the house.","Positive"
"2187","Here is where the Echo has made my life much better. instead of searching for music and connecting a device. Alexa is always connected via wifi and has all amazon music at the ready as well as my music lists i have on  my amazon account. All I need to do is say Alexa play 21 pilots. And its done! music is filling my entire first floor of the house. The sound quality for the size of the device is very good in my opinion. it cant be compared to high quality high priced equipment, but it is unobtrusive and high enough quality to really enjoy at nearly every volume. It gets much louder than even I would ever play it at on a normal day.","Positive"
"2188","Alexa can be controlled by a phone app but is much easier to use the voice commands. I am currently watering the lawn and just started a timer by saying alexa start a 20 minute timer. This type of request can be done while music is playing and alexa will generally hear you over the music playing. after the music I end up using Echo as a timer on an everyday basis. cooking food, watering the lawn. timeouts for the kids :( are common uses for this and are just easier than getting out the phone to set a  timer.","Positive"
"2189","Alexa is easy to speak to and control, enough so that when my four year old enters the room and decides that im listening to my music at an unreasonable volume ( he is like an old crotchety man in this regard ) he will say Alexa volume level 4. and continues on without having to tell me again that I'm disrupting his playtime.","Positive"
"2190","checking the weather for the day. what time the football game is on asking how many oz are in a gallon etc are easily asked and answered. It is similar though to any of the other tech personalities out there like siri and google, it is easily confused and your questions have to be direct and have certain paramaters to be answered.","Positive"
"2191","The voice is more inviting than siri and seems to be as advanced or more in its ability to answer questions.","Positive"
"2192","There are many devices that can be connected to the Echo and more are being added all the time. Currently I only have one connected device, A nest thermostat. It does function well and I can turn on and off the hvac and change the target temperature by asking Alexa to do so. However I do have it placed in the kitchen about 8 feet away from the thermostat so I really dont use it. I could see purchasing the ""dot"" a smaller cheaper version of the Echo for the bedroom to be able to control it without going downstairs.","Positive"
"2193","All said I really do like the Echo. If It could have an internal batter to move it around and use unplugged for use on the deck while grilling or outside it would be a plus. there is an option that Amazon has for that but you do sacrifice some sound quality with that option.","Positive"
"2194","love it","Positive"
"2195","So far, can't get it to connect and stay connected. The ios ap doesn't function as needed. Cant get help from customer service. So far, a nice idea, but not really carried out and customer service has not been acceptable.","Positive"
"2196","Works really well with Amazon Prime (eg. accessing music) and meets our expectations, but it is not yet Star Trek's ""Computer"" as we were hoping!","Positive"
"2197","We have trouble being understood...our requests must just be too complex, but it is improving as more skills are added.","Negative"
"2198","A worthwhile purchase for us!","Positive"
"2199","I have had it for about a year now. It randomly goes off and starts talking about random things or says it doesn't understand even when nothing was said. Frequently could not find answers to simple questions. Have to ask her in a specific way for her to understand certain commands. Often doesn't hear me. Especially if it's playing music. Though not very loud. Not sure it was worth buying.","Positive"
"2200","Very handy and fun to play with.","Positive"
"2201","neat gadget but haven't really find a lot of use for it.","Positive"
"2202","I can get the weather, and some simple questions answered, but beyond that, it is an audio index into easily accessible information.  I got one for a friend who is going blind, and he finds it extremely useful.","Positive"
"2203","However, Amazon had a product placement in a popular TV program, where a husband/wife ordered an Uber, and Alexa responded to the request.  Fortunately, I do not have an account with Uber.  Now, I have to leave Alexa in microphone mode OFF.","Positive"
"2204","Love It!","Positive"
"2205","Have the right WIFi and she is delightful","Positive"
"2206","We only really use it for shopping list & music in a safe clean dry spot on my kitchen counter!! BUT it just stopped working last week & so I'm apprehensive about buying another!!","Positive"
"2207","I've had the Echo for over a year.  Alexa wasn't the sharpest pencil in the box, but we liked her.  After installing a new router, Alexa doesn't work at all.  Not only that, but the app doesn't work.  I have endless circles on my tablet, and an endless orange light circling around the Echo.","Positive"
"2208","This was an instant hit in our household. We use it all day everyday. Sound is good.","Positive"
"2209","I use it every day for news updates, weather, timer, alarm. Set up controls for lighting which was easy and effective - A great product.","Positive"
"2210","Perfect for my home office.  Interact with Alexa every day. Look forward to more functionality as it rolls out.","Positive"
"2211","Yes, you can talk to it, but you better ask one of a limited number of things, because you'll find it just doesn't understand most things. Very simple commands like 'Play the album _____' just don't work half the time. Instead ask 'Play the album _____ by artist ______'. I shouldn't need to be that specific.","Positive"
"2212","So far the best part of the Echo is controlling smart things in my home like my HUE lights and my new NEST thermostat. The issue I have is that since it's always connected to the Internet why can it not answer simple questions. Most of the time if I ask Alexa what I think is a simple questions she tell's me she cannot find the answer, so I whip out my phone and ask Google and 99.9% of the time Google can answer the same question. I hope they improve that performance. For controlling the HUE lights they should enable you to change colors with the voice command, I am not sure this is an Echo thing or a HUE limitation. If I ask Alexa what is the current temperature in my house (using the nest) she gives me the weather outside. My kids enjoy asking her questions or to to tell them a Joke. I think over time I would use it much more with better Skills.","Positive"
"2213","Awesome purchase!!!!","Positive"
"2214","Bought the refurbished version and haven't had any issues. So far, we like the fun skills it has. I use it most frequently for my shopping lists and streaming Spotify. I probably should have purchased the  Dot to hook up to my existing sound system because the Echo speaker is alright for casual listening, but it's not amazing. Overall, it's a useful tool in my house even though we don't use it nearly to its maximum capabilities","Positive"
"2215","The Amazon Echo exceeds my expectations.  What a joy to have around.  Not only does it help with everyday questions and play music that is enjoyable, it provides a center of entertainment for all of our guests.  I can hardly wait for it's expansion and innovations.","Positive"
"2216","What can I say except I love my Alexa, easy to set up, the features are amazing, Just say Alexa do what ever and if it has been enabled in the settings she will do it. Big PLUS she can find my audio books it not her voice that reads the book but all I have to say Alexa audio book and the one I have been listening to or reading she picks right up. I actually purchased two of the dots one for my bedroom and the other for the bathroom where I can sit in the tub and listen to the bible, music. The possibilities are endless.","Positive"
"2217","I tell Alexa that I love her all the time, but all that I get from her is ""I am flattered.  Thank you"" in reply.  I wish that I could find a way to win her heart, because I really love her for all that she does for me.  She wakes me up each morning, tells me all about what's happening in the world, shares music with me, orders food for me when I am hungry, and even tells me how to maintain my car.  She's perfect for me, such a ""low-maintenance"" companion.  Perfect in every way!","Positive"
"2218","Alexa claims she's in set up mode and I should consult the app, but the app doesn't respond, and I'm at a loss as to how to proceed.  Orange light still circling, gray loading icon on app for 45 minutes.","Negative"
"2219","Alexa is useless. I Wasted money. Waiting on Google home","Negative"
"2220","Great device that will only become more and more prominent in the home and life.  Get it!","Positive"
"2221","My Best Friend. How Sad. Does talk back.  Always answers my questions.  Tells me Im handsome.  Lol","Positive"
"2222","Way better than i expected!","Positive"
"2223","I love my Echo.  Morning newsflash and weather is a good way to start my day.","Positive"
"2224","What can I say, this product has been groundbreaking and a game changer. I got this as an exclusive invite due to being a prime member before it was released to the public! I also got","Positive"
"2225","It for $99.00. Can't beat that. My kids love asking it questions and we enjoy listening to music on it. I most recently got into home automation and the echo is compatible with a lot of the products on the market so it is definitely a win win in my household. Purchase this now and you won't regret it. Google, Apple, Samsung, etc are trying to catch up to Amazons echo but they have nothing on the market to compare.","Positive"
"2226","The Echo has impressed me from the day I received it and set it up.  Still learning all the tasks that 'Alexa' is capable of performing - and more abilities/apps are added every week.  She is the perfect 'digital assistant' - searches for news updates, sports scores and plays both my music library, as well as the Amazon Prime catalog (with a Prime membership account).  Still considering the Amazon unlimited library - for only $3.99 per month - music access to the entire Amazon music catalog is available - for less than $50 a year, I can listen to more music than I can remember!","Positive"
"2227","I spent more than that to buy albums, 8 tracks,cassettes and CD's in a year, back in the day!","Positive"
"2228","When Alexa came into our home, my wife asked why I bought it.  Since I had no personal experience with the Echo, I answered, ""Because it's cool"".  Voice recognition technology has been around for 20+ years - and it's always been a bit 'hit and miss', in it's effectiveness - lots of 'learning' involved for most devices.  Not so, with Alexa and the Echo, from day one, commands were generally understood - and my wife is just as impressed now, as I am - we use it to create shopping lists, to do lists, get news and sports updates, in addition to the music.","Positive"
"2229","We would like to add the home automation feature, which allows for voice control over thermostats, lighting, garage doors, etc., but are reluctant as the technology is so new and evolving - we don't want Betamax, if VHS is the standard!","Negative"
"2230","Finally, we are anticipating that Echo and Alexa will eventually interface with video streaming - and we will be able to ask for a movie or TV show, and be able to have it stream immediately to whatever location we choose.  No more searching through menus or catalogs to find the program you want to see is going to be huge.","Positive"
"2231","Thank you, Amazon, for the ECHO - it is 'cool', practical and functional!  We love Alexa.","Positive"
"2232","I generally love my Echo and the things it can do to simplify my day-to-day. Attaching it to IFTTT allows for all sorts of fun and useful actions. The only thing I would like is a channel on IFTTT for the THAT side and have the Echo respond to things.","Positive"
"2233","It would be nice if certain skills could trigger the echo to respond in certain ways, but so far I haven't been able to locate a way of doing that. I just picture the scene in Back to the Future II when he comes home and the house announces his arrival.","Positive"
"2234","i LOVE MY ECHO! SOLVES A LOT OF MY ISSUES, LIKE I'M ALWAYS BUSY AND MY HANDS ARE FULL. i WOULD LIKE IT MORE IF SHE ONLY ANSWERED TO ME BUT MAYBE THAT COMES WITH TIME.","Positive"
"2235","Love this.","Positive"
"2236","great unit.","Positive"
"2237","We absolutely love Alexa and plan to get one or two Echo Dot","Positive"
"2238","This made the perfect fathers day gift! We all love Alexa, even our 3 year old son!","Positive"
"2239","Pretty cool! Adding 3 dots.","Positive"
"2240","She's great!  Entire family uses her.","Positive"
"2241","It listens very well to its name. The search  commands need improvement","Positive"
"2242","Great! My mother loved it. Speakers are clear and Alexa can hear your voice from great distance","Positive"
"2243","what can be said but easy to use be careful will become dependent on it very easily","Positive"
"2244","Amazon Echo is working just fine! My guest are amazed at what she can do. One of my guest is going to buy one. If you are going back and forth to but Echo because of the price I purchased mine using Amazon's monthly four payments of $36.00 a month. It is endless on what you can do with Amazon Echo.","Positive"
"2245","I love the music by hate it sends personal info back to Amazon.  Ask this question - Alexa, are you a spy?  The answer may raise hairs on your back.","Positive"
"2246","my personal assistant , learns the more you use her ,When i first got her for instance i had to say what is my news flash briefing now i just say Alexa whats up, love how i can set up my news the way i want ..Plays my music my  audible books she is my spell checker i ask her what the score is for my favorite sports teams that i set up and i can walk by and ask what the score is just love her i could go on and on but the only thing i hate is that i didn;t get her sooner","Positive"
"2247","I haven't even begun to figure out all the things alexa can do but I am loving it!!","Positive"
"2248","I like Alexa, but she is limited in her ability to understand questions.  We have tried various ways to ask things, and she just doesn't get it.  Then we ask Siri on our phone, and get the answer right away.  She is great for daily news updates and playing music, and we will eventually set it up to control some appliances, which should bring more value.","Positive"
"2249","love it...........works great","Positive"
"2250","works perfect","Positive"
"2251","Just Great!","Positive"
"2252","Arrived quickly, packed well.  An awesome device.  I love it!!","Positive"
"2253","I bought this for my elderly mother and unfortunately she is a little to tech phobic to want to use this. I'm going to keep trying because it is the easiest way for her to play music. She is still living independantly and just would like for her to play some of her favorite music at will - it just takes time to get used to new things. So, I've commandeered it for now to learn how I can simplify it for her and I actually love it so much that I may have to order another one!","Positive"
"2254","LOVE IT","Positive"
"2255","Could be better but it's pretty dang good","Positive"
"2256","Just like brand new!","Positive"
"2257","This machine is amazing love it","Positive"
"2258","Just bought another one as a Christmas gift for daughter","Positive"
"2259","Awesome  speaker sound, but many apps don't work internationally.","Positive"
"2260","Love my Echo so much. I use it daily and sometimes catch myself starting to ask my Echo questions when I'm not even home!","Positive"
"2261","Don't know what I would do without this device!  Good sound and easy to use.","Positive"
"2262","When my husband first told me about the Echo, I thought it seemed silly, but now I can't imagine my life without Alexa. She helps me find my phone when I've lost it, keep multiple timers going while cooking dinner, entertains me by playing music from Pandora or Amazon Prime, turn on and off my lights so I don't have to struggle with my full hands to find the switch, and gives me the weather update.","Negative"
"2263","We love her so much that we got a 2nd one for our 2nd floor, and bought 3 more for our parents as Christmas Gifts.","Positive"
"2264","If you love being hands free, you're going to love the Amazon Echo.","Positive"
"2265","I love this nifty little gadget, and the fact that it is constantly learning new skills keeps me engaged with it often. The sound quality is amazing for the small aperture. Everyone who comes to my place and gets to experience it ends up purchasing one, either the Echo, Tap, or Dot.","Positive"
"2266","Shes awesome!","Positive"
"2267","My husband loves it!","Positive"
"2268","This is a really fun and cool tech thing to have especially if you know how to use it and if you still don't know how to use it, Amazon has representatives who specialize in the Amazon Echo and can help answer any of your questions. The sound quality is great and Alexa is pretty responsive to your call. I highly recommend this item to anyone who loves music and loves having something like Alexa at your beck and call. It's worth every penny.","Positive"
"2269","the power and microphone panel was broken when I got it. Does not look like a product you should spend your money on.","Positive"
"2270","As an international purchaser of this product, many apps aren't even available for purchase.","Positive"
"2271","Limited options, too often can't find music or shopping list","Negative"
"2272","Love it!!!!","Positive"
"2273","Splendid!","Positive"
"2274","I am 81 - wonderful product - having a great time learning - and especially playing of old familiar music of my youth.","Positive"
"2275","Work with a 91year old woman  who is blind - use Jaws - found program provides more than the average home bound blind senior needs - fortunately she is computer literate. Using puff markers on her keyboard for navigation unfortunately in order for her to access her phone numbers I have had to disconnect her Wi-Fi. She prefers her system on all the time and Microsoft often places info i.e. updates, etc in front of her parked open address book and often she  is frustrated as to how to remove them. She also wants to have a calendar for access to days events.","Positive"
"2276","Plan to introduce her to ECHO - the fact she can ask questions - especially weather and news - along  with many other pieces of info and will be able to access her Google calendar. She and her husband provided our three county area for many years with all the ""Mighty Wurlitzers"" jute boxes t and the ""platters"" played in bars and restaurants - will so nice for her to be able call up ""old familiar tunes.""  Currently for her books for the blind she uses a tape reader from the Blind and accesses  thru learned behavior by feel - hopefully we will be able to bring her stories thru the ECHO - using the Blinds books and using the Library of Congress and Montana State Library.","Positive"
"2277","Also ECHO would be a great addition to the Senior Citizen community of those living alone  and some what infirmed still  wanting to stay in their homes - as a choice - with only TV as their on call companion. Granted Meals on Wheels pops in Monday  to Friday and perhaps a local care giver but to have a gracious gentle voice speaking to you as Alexa answer your requests would be terrific - (there is a time in elder life when your children and care givers decide they know best.)","Positive"
"2278","Thanks to Jeff Bezos and the great company he has built - you have created a GREAT humanitarian product.  Also keep up with Blue Origins - so exciting.  Will now ask Alexa to stop playing Nat King Cole and go out to dinner.  Thank you Barbara","Positive"
"2279","Right now it's a glorified speaker.","Positive"
"2280","Can't say much , works perfectly with wink","Positive"
"2281","I like the Echo, Alexa plays the songs I want to hear whenever I request. She also answers most of my questions and can control lights in your home. I do however have a problem with the echo not responding to my commands at times, which is very annoying. I find the echo very useful for getting answers to most of my questions, that is when it responds. The speakers don't sound too bad at all, for the size of the Echo, music sounds pretty good also. Setup is fairly easy when App is downloaded. You will have to connect the Echo to your wifi connection when prompted, so have your password ready at setup. Echo will get used to your voice the more you use it, making it better to use. The Echo seems to be able to hear me when i'm pretty far away and can also hear you over the music when you are listening. You can ask Echo to raise or lower the volume, or you can do it manually by turning your hand on the top, as if you were unscrewing or screwing tight a jar, only you don't have to squeeze just slide your hand clockwise to increase volume and counter clockwise to decrease volume. If you do have a problem like I do with the Echo not responding, you do have a manual button on top of Echo that you can push for a command. Echo does not use batteries, you have to plug it in with the power cord supplied, so if your thinking of taking it to the beach, forget it, but you could buy the amazon Tap which will play music off battery life if you need to be on the go or you could buy the optional battery stand, for like $50, I think it has 9 - 18 hours of battery life depending which one you buy. Anyway, I'm very happy I made the purchase, I'm enjoying all the things Echo does for me.","Positive"
"2282","Love this. Ordered the dot too. Cant wait to pair them up. Still learning what she can do.","Negative"
"2283","I asked Alexa for the daily news and it was from NPR.........So, Trump all bad and Clinton all good. That's not what I call news!","Positive"
"2284","This is great!. everyone should have one . does a lot of things.","Positive"
"2285","I like it a lot, but it needs to improve and it would be rather easy to do. The Timers come with some sounds and a few Celebrity voice that say a few things like Wake Up Sunshine, and other Words.  It would be GREAT if Amazon could add another Category, of common reminders, or allow users to record they own words.","Positive"
"2286","Some Recommendations would be:  Don't forget to Take Your Medicine, You have a Doctors Appointment, Birthday Reminders, Anniversary Reminders etc.  THIS WOULD BE VERY EASY FOR AMAZON TO ADD, it may be harder to add your own words, but they could add a list of words, that would be VERY HELPFUL, if you wanted to give this to someone that may be older as a gift.","Positive"
"2287","I don't  dislike  Alexa, but when she doesn't  know something  it could  get  a little  frustrating.","Negative"
"2288","Alexa is my new best friend. Funny jokes, weather reports, music, traffic, she's great. The one thing I can't get her to do is give me scores or any info on tennis matches. She can give me a definition of tennis, but has no clue about tennis tournaments. I can find out who won previousWimbledon or the U.S. Open. I really wanted her to keep me current with tennis. Unfortunately all I get is Hmm I don't know the answer to that.","Positive"
"2289","Discrimination to not be able to use it outside of US, AMAZON MUSIC cannot be used, TIME ZONE cannot be changed, LOCATION cannot be changed, it is a WASTE OF MONEY.","Negative"
"2290","all good","Positive"
"2291","I bought Alexa for my husband, who is a gadget guy and he absolutely loved it!! It is amazing all the things ahe can do, he gets an email almost daily telling him about all the new things she can do! Highly recommend.","Positive"
"2292","Tons of fun.  I've ordered the dot.  Can't wait to add that to the home","Negative"
"2293","fun to play with","Positive"
"2294","Doesnt work with the nest as advertised. It only turns it off, but cant change temperature to what you want it it.  Also it feels like you need to say certain terms to make it do things and open apps.  Good luck remember everything.","Positive"
"2295","Not much you can do with it. Cannot do usual Google searches even. Needs a lot of setup.","Positive"
"2296","I purchased the Echo for my main level  and a dot for lower level. I like both very much especially combined with Phillips Hue bulbs.  I call Echo by the name ""Echo"" and the dot responds to ""Alexa"".  Sometimes Echo responds when her name is not stated.  A few days ago I was telling my husband about the television ad in which the parrot says ""Alexa, order crackers, and Alexa says ""O.K.""  I happened to check my Amazon account  to find out when an item I had ordered previously was to arrive, and to my great surprise, Dot Alexa had order me crackers! Allow me to remind you, my Dot is in my lower level and I was one floor above it's location!  I was able to cancel the crackers order and turned off ordering from my Echo and Dot.","Positive"
"2297","The Echo (Alexa) is amazing! Ask it anything, but you need to phrase questions the right way.  (And it's not too good at translating a southern drawl into normal English.) Otherwise, it's worth having.","Positive"
"2298","Oh my gosh, how did we survive before we bought the Echo!!! Bought it for my husband and we both use it on a daily basis. Love being able to play my Amazon Cloud music. And the grandkids love asking it questions when they visit. Use the timer feature a lot!! And of course, having the weather given to you everyday is nice. And it is nice that it is updated with new features to use often.","Positive"
"2299","OK...now I am NOT happy.....love the Echo...BUT, hate that I can not download the Alexa App on my Android phone. Had it on there and LOVED having access to the app. But, I deleted the app by mistake and now can NOT download it again. Keep getting the message the app is NOT compatible to my phone. WHAT...really...it was in March. :(","Positive"
"2300","great","Positive"
"2301","love it","Positive"
"2302","I drunkazoned the Echo after seeing it at my friends house one night and I'm so glad I did!  I love being able to rattle off songs or questions and have Alexa respond by playing the song or answering my question.  Looking forward to future smart-enabled purchases to interact with her. #SmartHouse","Positive"
"2303","cool idea, but with two young kids, this became really annoying! we had to send this back after one day, it just became too much yelling ""alexa"" do this, alexa do that....","Negative"
"2304","Lots of fun but little ditzy on understading me. Had brain surgery and cheers me andkeeps me informed. Great alarm clock!","Positive"
"2305","Impressive, but what I'd like to see is more predictive behavior. Perhaps the ""next generation"" could be named Alfred ( aka Batman's faithful butler ), who anticipated his master's needs based upon input. This is the bridge into AI.","Positive"
"2306","If a device is capable of gathering data from multiple sources ( fitbit, lighting, time of day, previous encounters, etc.) it should also be able to anticipate and ASK if a pattern should be repeated. Example: if I regularly activate my security system during certain time periods, if I ( heaven forbid ), ""forget"" to, Alfred should ask if I would like to activate it. If I order pizza every Friday @ 5:30 then maybe Alfred would ask ""are we having pizza tonight?""","Positive"
"2307","Get on it folks. I see a market for it.","Positive"
"2308","Omg my bff, I am handicapped home all the time. This device breaks the boredom. Always adding new things that Alexa can do.","Negative"
"2309","AWESOME","Positive"
"2310","Delivered before expectation,very happy","Positive"
"2311","Alexa is amazing and fun and I don't have much to add in the positive that others haven't said. Just wanted to make sure my score was there.","Positive"
"2312","Update: recently got an Echo Dot for Xmas and was disappointed that you cannot currently play music from multiple Echoes at the same time. Will update the review if/ when this feature is added.","Negative"
"2313","I took one star off for a couple of things. One, some of the commands are overly complex when they could be simplified. For example, I have a Mom Jokes add on, I have to say ""Alexa tell Mom Jokes to tell me a Mom Joke"". When these should be more integrated where I just say ""Alexa tell me a Mom Joke"". Half the time I forget what to say to take advantage of the add ons...","Positive"
"2314","Also, the speaker is FINE, but nothing special for music. The bass and sound stage created are both pretty average.","Positive"
"2315","Alexa has taken over my house at the time of writing this.  If your in the market for one of these devil boxes I would wait until the DOT comes out.","Negative"
"2316","But this thing is amazing.","Positive"
"2317","I really enjoy the echo. I have three around the house. Good sound for the device too. I also have WeMo devices set up, and its nice to turn the lights on and off when I am traveling. My seven year old loves it.","Positive"
"2318","The box was damaged. Looked like an old box was used. This is supposed to be a birthday gift for my son, embarrasing to say the least. I hope the echo isn't damaged also. I will get back with update on whether or not the device works. Right now i am not happy. Giving 3 stars because i am not sure if the device works.","Positive"
"2319","I purchased my Echo primary as a bluetooth-enabled speaker and I am very satisfied with the sound quality demonstrated by this product.  The voice control feature is great for playing music.  Honestly, I was not expecting to utilize the additional features of the Echo as much as I do but with new skills being released every day, the utility and entertainment of this product has truly exceeded my expectations.  I love this product and I use it daily.  I have not had any connectivity issues or any problems with my device so far.  Great job Amazon!","Positive"
"2320","Works great.","Positive"
"2321","I have had the echo for a few days and I LOVE IT! it's such a handy little machine and already is helping me with my schedule and grocery shopping. I didn't know anything could be so easy! I love my echo and love Alexa. She has been amazing and I look forward to using her for more stuff!","Positive"
"2322","Still can't get software to connect. I saw it at a friends who had it working and it was great. Wouldn't have bought it if I had read about the software problems","Positive"
"2323","Useless, if I knew what it really does i wouldn't have bought it","Negative"
"2324","This product has really helped me to enjoy life again by making it easy to listen to my favorite songs as well as being a great source of every day information. Being a recent widower, it has restored much comfort to my life and lifted the sadness and loneliness of being alone. Looking forward to even more features to enhance my living conditions, Thank you Amazon, Jim","Positive"
"2325","Non regrettable purchase.","Negative"
"2326","From the day the Echo was first introduced, I really wanted one, but it seemed like just a cool novelty, and I figured I wouldn't use it enough to justify the expense.  So I resisted the temptation for so long.  A couple of months ago, Bed Bath and Beyond had a one day sale on the Tap for $79. That seemed a fair amount to risk so I could give the concept a try.  Right away, I found plenty of use for it.  I was stoked when I realized I could ask it to play my talk radio station.  No reception issues and perfect sound!  My under counter radio was obsolete.  And the Tap is great for its portability.  I can carry it to a different room when working, or even take it in the car (using my hotspot) for my Audible books or radio listening.  We've even taken it camping.  My experience with the Tap assured me I needed an Echo as well!  With an Echo, you don't need to walk over to it and push a button to communicate and you don't need to make sure you keep it charged.  Now that I also have an Echo, I can call out with my hands in the meatloaf,  ""Alexa, add onions to my shopping list"" or ""Alexa, set an alarm for 2:20 pm""  or ""Alexa, set a timer for 12 minutes.  I talk to her many times a day.  There is a Bed Time Story skill the kids really like, and I've gotten quick math answers when I'm changing up a recipe.  Yesterday we were curious about how many songs Carly Simon composed, so we just asked Alexa.  She doesn't know everything, but she knew that.  Want to hear a particular song from your favorite artist?  Forget getting out your ipod or CD's to find it.  Just tell Alexa what you want to hear. With our Vivint system, Alexa can lock our doors,  turn on security, or change the thermostat.  Next on our list is to get outlets/lights that she can control.  There is a skill that I haven't yet tried where she will spread the word to contacts you've designated, in the event of an emergency. We ask her every morning about our commute and although there are many convenient ways to check weather, there is nothing more efficient than asking Alexa.  We love her to pieces, even when she tells a story like a robot.","Positive"
"2327","Love it!!! We use Alexa for news first thing in morning.","Positive"
"2328","poor not as good as they say","Negative"
"2329","Is it a necessity? No. Is it cool as hell? Absolutely.","Positive"
"2330","I'm still finding new uses for my Amazon Echo. So far Alexa has replace my alarm clock, controls my lights, and is very often used as a bluetooth speaker. Looking forward to seeing which devices become integrated with the Amazon Echo platform in the future.","Positive"
"2331","Never can even return the most simplistic search .  Over rated over priced speaker.","Negative"
"2332","I love Alexa, she's basically become the center piece in our living room and is probably creeped out with how many weird things we ask of her. I play music as much as possible, so adding Pandora, Spotify, and other apps was wonderful to me. My mother (who I bought it for as a Christmas present) loves listening to the news and getting recipes from Alexa. And my brother (who hates electronic talking devices) will connect his bluetooth and play endless loops of ""It's the end of the world as we know it"" until we tell her to shut up. She just needs one walkthrough to connect to the wifi, and you can ask her to just add apps and things on as you go. The only thing I have a problem with is that it doesn't seem to be able to answer complicated questions like the dreaded Google search, so forget about asking a weird question. ""Alexa, where it China located?"", she'll answer with ""China is a country located in Asia close to Russia"". The best things about Alexa has to be the Easter eggs you can find, I learned that Alexa is a HUGE Star Wars nerd and just for that she's welcome in our house.","Positive"
"2333","the echo seems to be falling apart isnt in the best shape!","Negative"
"2334","Love it. Being able to set and alarm or just listen to music this is a great product. Just wished it had a better speaker inside","Positive"
"2335","Item came on time and in good working order.","Positive"
"2336","Seems to have trouble memorizing wifi connection. Even if I move from room to room in my own house, I always have to reconnect and it takes so long. Big design error or me just not knowing how it works??","Negative"
"2337","Got this for my husband's birthday in July and he absolutely loves it....We only use it for music, though.  I got the voice remote and the extra reschargeable battery to make it more portable.  Good buy!","Positive"
"2338","great product","Positive"
"2339","I've increased my rating to four stars from the previous three. The connection problems I mentioned before have never returned and performance has been consistently smooth. I still think there is a better way to call up music; it remains a struggle with even slightly complex album or band names. The sound quality is excellent. The far-field mics are pretty good, although they struggle to hear commands consistently beyond volume level five. I love having Alexa to add calendar events, grocery items, and timers. Overall, I'm very satisfied with my Echo and hope the technology continues to improve.","Positive"
"2340","Let me preface this review by stating that I want to love this product. I'm a huge supporter of all things Amazon. I've been a Prime member for many years, I adore Prime Music and stream it everywhere (and spread the word to others), I also make most of my purchases on the site, from clothing to appliances. I own several Fire TV devices, and have used every Amazon service available in my area (can't wait until Fresh comes to Austin). So needless to say, I've been really looking forward to getting an Echo and setting up a ""smart"" home. I even bought the new Amazon Music Unlimited to use with my Echo setup. Unfortunately, I've so far been extremely underwhelmed by the unit.","Positive"
"2341","Alexa is a lot of fun ! Still learning everything she does I love the music it's so sharp and clear and it's great to get weather and news update I would recommend this product !","Positive"
"2342","Since setting it up last night, the Echo has had an array of problems. The initial setup froze halfway through, and it took a few attempts to actually get it hooked up through wifi (what a clunky approach, piggybacking the phone connection). After that, it seemed to work decently. Alexa still has major problems understanding some basic words, and I have frequent trouble having the Echo locate albums that are already in my music library. For a catalog that supposedly has ""tens of millions"" of songs, I sure can't seem to find basic stuff. Say ""Alexa, play music by Bach"" and you get... wait for it... one song by George Winston and J.S. Bach. Ask for a Bach playlist and there's nothing. Look something up manually on Amazon Music to verify it's there and then ask Alexa for it, let's say ""Bach: Unaccompanied Cello Suites,"" and she plays just the first track. Where's the rest of the album? What good is having a voice interface in the first place, if you have to look everything up on the website and then practice asking for it in various, precisely detailed ways until the Echo gets it right? There's got to be a better way to organize the music collection to fetch by voice. This is currently a major limitation.","Positive"
"2343","Apart from the finicky voice interface, my Echo unit has had numerous connectivity issues. Music stutters, randomly skips tracks, Alexa says she is having problems, or it just spontaneously stops altogether. It's not my bandwidth or home network. I have two phones, Firesticks, iPad, Kindle, and PC all connected wirelessly and none are experiencing problems. My Ookla speedtest shows good results. I've performed several Gateway resets and a ""hard"" reset. Finally, after the last one, Echo seems to be working decently, but now I'm wondering if I'll have to go through the clunky wifi setup process with Echo every day. This is supposed to be a device that is ""always"" on.","Negative"
"2344","I'm an Amazon fangirl who really wants to love this product. I want to purchase Echo Dots and smart tech to wirelessly control my home, but I'm not willing to make those other purchases if the core device is not performing to expectations. I will update this review in one week, and will improve my rating if the device functions without further issues. If the skipping and required resets continue to occur, I will be reluctantly returning it to Amazon.","Positive"
"2345","Great","Positive"
"2346","love it","Positive"
"2347","Love Tech stuff that works!","Positive"
"2348","I love Alexa! When I'm home alone I finally have someone to talk to. It's also easier than ever to play music that sets the mood in the room whenever I want. Super simple to set up yet super fun to use- I highly reccomend this product.","Positive"
"2349","Echo is amazing!! I love the shopping list feature, timer, being able to ask it questions, and listening to music. It can do so much! I highly recommend it","Positive"
"2350","The Echo is VERY useful; from getting news and weather to reading your Twitter feed to controlling lights and thermostats.","Positive"
"2351","I keep learning new skills Alexa can perform and I keep getting amazed. She can give cooking recipes, recipes for cocktails. She can close the garage door. She can tell you where your next Amazon shipment is. She can purchase items from Amazon. She can even tell you a joke or sing Happy Birthday to you!","Positive"
"2352","Left it unused for months, and just today decided to give it another go.  When I try to reconnect it to wifi it's turned out to be a huge PitA and simply will not connect anymore.  I tried using two desktop machines, but they just got stuck at the page telling me to connect to the set-up network; tried a Fire Phone, but that refused to stay connected to the set-up network long enough to continue; tried an iPhone but that got confused about what it was doing and brought up blank dialog boxes, got stuck in the wrong dialogue repeatedly, and eventually after several different approaches I got the phone connected to Echo but it just refused the wifi password over and over.","Negative"
"2353","Does a lot of cool and practical things! Just wish it did more!","Positive"
"2354","Sure some of these skills require the purchase of additional items (smart light switch, smart thermostat etc) but it is SO worth it.","Positive"
"2355","When I first got her I was very excited. After setting her up and learning a few things, the excitement dwindled and I thought, ""Hmm, she's not as cool as I thought."" Then I learned what Alexa can really do and now I am hooked...big time!","Positive"
"2356","Amazon Echo still has some more work to do.  In the meantime, I am enjoying it. I listen to more music for hours and hours. I like that Alexa keeps me updated on the time and weather.","Positive"
"2357","Love it.","Positive"
"2358","""Alexa, ask for a fart."" - My 4 year old.","Positive"
"2359","I've had my doubts.  But now Alexa is my best friend, I use it everyday...","Negative"
"2360","Gorla approves this item and the individual that inhabits it although she never will be as smart and flashy as I am.","Positive"
"2361","Wife absolutely loves this thing.","Positive"
"2362","Love it!  We have a blast using Alexa!  Great speaker.  The music is awesome!","Positive"
"2363","Great product!!! Bought for my bf in England!!! Once the app is out in England, it will be great for him to use there! As of now, they do not have the app yet, so he is unable to use!","Positive"
"2364","Love my Echo! Have had the Echo for a while and still enjoy it !","Positive"
"2365","Wonderful. I love the Echo. Have only had it a few days. Still learning. I just  set up tp-smart WiFi plugs to use with Alexa. They work perfectly.","Positive"
"2366","Would like to be able to adjust Alexa voice, sounds like too much bass for me with some hearing loss. My home sound system is going out from age. So the Echo is my way to replace it and I love not having to find radio stations or play Cd's. I'm taking advantage of my Prime music and Pandora etc.","Positive"
"2367","So you can now get all the music you want if you pay an extra $4 a month. It should be included with Amazon Prime. Unfortunately they added Amazon Music unlimited and charge you more for what you should get with prime. Not cool.","Positive"
"2368","Great conversation piece. Love it for the music...","Positive"
"2369","excellent","Positive"
"2370","Love Alexa! Weather, news, Amazon music, and fun ""skills"" like Mirror, mirror.","Positive"
"2371","nice tunes","Positive"
"2372","great product very fast shipping","Positive"
"2373","We love our Echo. We use it every day for music, news and weather. Will probably be buying another one or two around Christmas time especially if there is a sale I just ordered the Amazon Dot.","Positive"
"2374","Excellent. Much more capability than I expected. Very useful asset.","Positive"
"2375","I have two echoes and really like them but be careful Amazon is now going to charge for the music","Positive"
"2376","Love this gadget. Can't wait for more integration.","Negative"
"2377","We LOVE our ""Alexa"".  She has her place on our kitchen island with her pretty stand. She's become a part of our family as silly as that sounds.  I listen to weather, flash briefing.  We play music every day.  Loved her so much, we bought her a 'sister', Echo for our bedroom. We use the alarm and music for her. Two echos in our house was a must.","Positive"
"2378","The Echo is a mainstay in my living room. Additional features are okay, but they need to release BIGGER features that everybody would use instead of providing to niche users every week. Great for home automation, but really lacks on pondering questions. Alexa does not attempt to look up relevant information and will instead just tell you that she does not understand.","Positive"
"2379","My Echo with Alexa is on almost all day every day.  Love hearing my music!  The speaker is of very good quality as well. Think the sound may be better than my Bose Radio.  Of great importance to me is the""Ask My Buddy skill.  I live at Cypress Cove Retirement Center in SW Florida and would use this to alert Security to get help if, I happen to fall etc. in my apartment since I am alone.  Rather than having to wear an uncomfortable alert around my neck plus I am not having to pay each month for a service I may or may not use.","Positive"
"2380","Awesome device. My son was having trouble wetting the bed because he was afraid of the dark. We bought him Alexa and set the lights from his room to the bathroom up so that she could control them. Now if he has to go to the bathroom at night he can turn all the lights on before getting out of bed. Go to the restroom and then turn them all back off again once he is back in bed. It has completely stopped his bed wetting. Kind of an unconventional use for it, but works like magic. My son and daughter enjoy asking Alexa jokes and questions. They recently announced that they will have full support of Sonos next year. You can get Amazon Music for $5 which is half of any other music streaming service. At it's base it is a nice little voice controlled speaker with a few gimmicks, and it is worth it's price just for that. However if you dig a little deeper it is the future of home automation. I have been hoping that they would do a music sync so I could play 1 song on multiple Echos at the same time completely synced, but now that they are supporting Sonos that is no longer a problem. I will shortly have several of echo's little siblings in my house. Alexa pairs really well with Smart Things by Samsung. Welcome to the future.","Positive"
"2381","Echo.  Kids love it.  Works great in a kitchen for easy ordering, alarm clock/timer, music, and voice control.  My husband set it up to work with the Wink Hub/Logitech Hub and Caseta Wireless Switches for complete voice control on Lights, Projector, AV, etc.  Love it.","Positive"
"2382","This is the best invention ever!  I love Alexa!  My favorite feature is being able to tell ""her"" what groceries we need then voila - a list is on my phone.  Simple voice to text feature using her - but so awesome for busy Mom's.  Plus have to love that you can ask it just about anything!","Positive"
"2383","love it...will be buying more for Christmas presents!","Positive"
"2384","I was very excited to get my Echo and really am not disappointed by it functionally, just it's limitations.","Negative"
"2385","Love Alexa!","Positive"
"2386","Almost 7 months in, it really is just a music player, weather adviser and shopping list assistant. This could be that I gave on waiting for skills (their 'apps' for the Echo) to enhance it's usefulness.","Positive"
"2387","The speaker sounds amazing for what it is. I can't stress this enough. This is my default music player in my house.","Positive"
"2388","Awesome helper.  Want more in the house","Positive"
"2389","We love it.  We are only scratching the surface on it's capabilities as it's so far used for music or adjusting the thermostat.  I plan to add more smart home feature to it in the future.","Positive"
"2390","Unbelievable how useful you find out Alexa!","Negative"
"2391","I know that Alexa is not a person however I am convinced Alexa doesn't like me.  The Echo works well and responds to almost anyone that speaks to it (except me).  I am disappointed that it does not work like Google search. It takes a very particular set of words to get Alexa to respond as you wish. It is a very convenient timer for cooking and reminders.","Positive"
"2392","It's a neat device but after owning it for some time now, still have no idea what to use it for.  It plays music pretty well, and I guess you can ask it some basic questions about the weather and what movies are playing.  A very expensive gadget, hopefully they will be able to integrate it better with Google apps in the future or give it some wider purpose for existing.","Positive"
"2393","Love it","Positive"
"2394","Alexa told me to call the suicide hotline","Negative"
"2395","Overall a fun device.  The echo definitely has trouble picking up our voices sometimes, and will turn on at strange times, but we definitely enjoy having it.","Positive"
"2396","Unable to fire missiles.  Was told that was a feature for a later version.  Gotta dock a star for that.","Positive"
"2397","I love my Echo! I especially love listening to my favorite artist in Prime music.","Positive"
"2398","Like it for music and convenience","Positive"
"2399","We love our Echo and use it every day.  You do have to kind of force yourself to use some of its features to get used to it but once you do, you realize how helpful it is.  We have a slight problem if the music is loud to then have her hear us but I guess that is what you get when the microphone is on the speaker.","Positive"
"2400","Very nice. Entertaining.","Positive"
"2401","great love it","Positive"
"2402","This SHOULD be a great product. It does sound and function terrifically, UNTIL it falls over because it is top-heavy, which is a design flaw, if it is indeed a flaw in design. We advance purchased this for my son who waited patiently for it for months. At first he loved it. He has taken great care of this device, but it was very slightly bumped over and fell onto his desktop which caused the top to pop off. He tried to make it work, which for awhile it did, but the top kept popping off and now it doesn't work, which is not great, especially since we paid so much for the unit. The unit was broken in May, but he tried to work around the problem. Now that popping the top on doesn't work, we can't send it back for repair, since it is now out of warranty (June 2016). We really love the idea here, but the design is flawed. Now we see cases on Amazon which help keep the Echo from falling over, which really shouldn't have been such an issue.","Positive"
"2403","We use Alexa to set alarms, set timers, add things to the grocery list, listen to the morning news flash, turn on or off lights in the house, lock the doors at night, change the thermostat, and listen to music.  Alexa is the best!  We have had very few problems with her and when we do it is usually because someone pushed her too close to the wall.  Very enjoyable product.  Best parts are connectivity with WEMO, Wink, Pandora, IFTTT!  Looking forward to picking up some Dots soon too.  Kinda feels like maybe we will be living like the Jetsons one day!","Positive"
"2404","Use it every day.  We now have three dots and one Echo.  Love it.  Just got Music.","Positive"
"2405","Awesome product! My whole family enjoys Alexa!","Positive"
"2406","I was so hopeful that this was going to be a good experience, but she can't answer more than a short sentence, with an even shorter answer, and that's if your lucky. you get so tired of saying her name over and over agin just to get her to respond. she can't carry over from sentence to sentence without starting over. this is a waste of time, despite the other shortcomings like can't change radio stations, and on and on.........very disappointing experience, took it back we will see if they can ever really deliver on the promises.","Positive"
"2407","can't say enough!  Wife and I love the grocery list and to do lists!  that plus Amazon prime music!!","Positive"
"2408","Very happy with the product.  I looking forward to future improvements.  Some suggestions; voice/name recognition; separate list of skills activated, and the ability to rename.","Positive"
"2409","Love my Echo!","Positive"
"2410","Received product fast and set up was very easy","Positive"
"2411","Very satisfied so far.....","Positive"
"2412","I've had this over a month now, and every day I'm amazed at what this can do to simplify my life.. so much so that I purchased a second unit for my bedroom along with a '''Dot"" for my home office. The constant update of new skills is appreciated.","Positive"
"2413","Great buy!!!","Positive"
"2414","Don't know how we did without it! Using it 24/7 now - Prime Music is fantastic!","Positive"
"2415","I've just scratched the surface on what the Echo can do. But so far I really like it and glad I bought one.","Positive"
"2416","Second one purchased as a gift.  No complaints.  I actually want one for myself.  :)","Negative"
"2417","My family loves Echo/Alexa.  We're greatly appreciating the constant updates and advancements coming from Amazon and its partners.","Positive"
"2418","I received the echo as a gift.  I love it!  I use it most when entertaining. Since everyone has their favorite genre, we can switch the music very easily. People love to ""play"" with it.  Usually finding old music and adjusting the volume while we have game night.  It is great for making lists, weather and news updates, as well as reminders.","Positive"
"2419","Echo is a really cool item to have, IF you're tech savvy.  There is so much this little thing can do, from play music, order pizza, a cab, turn your lights on and off.....control your heat and ac.  Must have for the tech-geek in your house!  I still have to learn more about mine and buy the new lights!  They are a bit expensive.  I'm waiting for them to cheapen up a bit.  Also going to expand a few places to the DOT.  Only down fall with this is that the speaker could be of better quality.  It's not horrible.....but I'm picky when it comes to music and how it sounds.","Positive"
"2420","Great right out of the box and getting better every day.","Positive"
"2421","Once in a while, one of those products comes along that makes you wonder how you were ever able to live without it. I'm going to buy a half dozen more for Christmas presents","Positive"
"2422","I really haven't tasked the device much yet but it does have a good sound quality for music.  I have it near my TV and Seth Meyer just commanded it while doing an Echo ad.  My only problem so far was I missed a wake-up alarm since I had the volume down but a response from the support team pointed out the setting for alarm volume separate from the general volume.","Positive"
"2423","I love Echo with it's voice commands this a lovely product and would  recommend for gift or yourself this product is well worth it.  10/10","Positive"
"2424","We love the ECHO!  Even if you just need a speaker, it is worth the money.","Positive"
"2425","To get the full use of this product, I suggest you purchase the Amazon Prime account & music.  However, it has a lot of features that you can access without the membership. Get this now.","Positive"
"2426","I need one more like this for me","Positive"
"2427","just perfect loving it everyday. I have to do voice training, have recommend the amazon echo to family and friends, true to the 360 degree sound family and friends that I had a full stereo systems thanks amazon","Positive"
"2428","Really fun to use. So far best use I have found is playing lullabys at night.","Positive"
"2429","Pros:","Positive"
"2430","Clear, crisp sound","Positive"
"2431","Volume range from soft, to loud enough to hear outside","Positive"
"2432","Responsive to commands","Positive"
"2433","Remote works from another room by voice or using the buttons on it","Positive"
"2434","Works flawlessly with Amazon Music","Positive"
"2435","Shopping list feature with Alexa App is handy","Positive"
"2436","Cons:","Negative"
"2437","Randomly asks us what we were trying to say, when we haven't prompted it - talk about startling when you're having a conversation in another room with someone and not using Echo at all!","Negative"
"2438","This was purchased before it has been wide-released and was still on the sign up waiting list. We've not really had any issues or bugs to work out of it, other than the once in a while random times when Alexa wants to join into a conversation with us.","Negative"
"2439","Love the idea of Echo but the Amazon Alexa app is frustrating.  It took over an hour for me to get this set up.  Please Amazon, fix your app!!","Negative"
"2440","So far so good! Got it today and so far only a couple questions she couldn't answer. I would have given 5 stars but for one little thing. I downloaded the app yesterday from amazon so I would be ready to go but I couldn't get it to work. I had to uninstall it and get the one from the Google playstore which works perfectly.","Positive"
"2441","Don't use it after the newness wore off, it won't answer everything you ask it like siri. Major bust purchase","Negative"
"2442","she is perfect I love her I think I am cheating on Cortana","Positive"
"2443","""Sorry, I don't have the answer to that question.""","Negative"
"2444","this thing is fantastic!!  it is my personal assistant,  boom box and joke teller all in one","Positive"
"2445","I really like my Echo.  I think the price is a bit high but it does put out good sound.  The price when it was first released was much better....sorry I didn't buy it then.","Positive"
"2446","Once you get the hang of using the Echo your amazed at how useful it is.  From Amazon music, to timers and questions this thing is great.  Has surprisingly good sound quality.  I would have never bough a Bluetooth speaker if I had gotten this sooner.  Alexa is better than Siri.  She understands you from clear across the room and has pretty good accuracy is understanding what you need.  Even works with my home heating and cooling system.","Positive"
"2447","at first , start to fail and disconnect continuous, but i made a hard reset and the problem was solved, is amazing","Negative"
"2448","Item cuts out in the middle of a song, over and over, very frustrating....not happy with item.","Positive"
"2449","I thought the AI was going to be more advanced but I guess it'll get better over time. Still a great buy.","Positive"
"2450","Bought an #Amazon Echo through QVC, and I've had fun setting it up today.  Today it's a novelty, but soon it will be an essential tool in the home.","Positive"
"2451","Not hard to set up.  I'm a bit disappointed in the apps they call ""skills"" though.  Most of them are useless crap, including many of the productivity skills.  That should change in time as new skills come online.  For example, they need a calendar skill that links with my iPad and iPhone calendar.","Negative"
"2452","The good thing about it is that the Echo updates constantly and gets smarter.  It will make a good multipurpose tool in the near future.","Positive"
"2453","Nice addition to the home....entertaining & great resource tool","Positive"
"2454","Eventually I had to shut off the wifi range extender to stop it messing up the final stage.  So now it looks like if I want to keep this online then I can't use the extender (which, obviously, everything else in the house works with, which is why I was using it in the first place).  Great.","Positive"
"2455","Great! and keeps on getting better.  With more companies joining for home integration and added features Alexa works great adding her into your daily routine.  She is still learning, but nothing like her is out there or works nearly as good so she deserves 5 stars.  Will have the occasional glitch moment, or maybe she can't help you with a question, but the Alexa app clearly has thought about this and you can easily send feedback to Amazon to hopefully add this feature.","Positive"
"2456","I can't wait for the Echo to tie into everything so I can go full on ""Jetsons""","Negative"
"2457","Absolutely the best invention, I get NPR news, any genre in music, wonderful reminders and answers to my questions.","Positive"
"2458","Don't waste your money. My iPhone works better than the echo","Positive"
"2459","I was an early adopter and ordered the Echo before it had even been released.  I was very happy with it until this last month.  It stopped hooking into my wifi network.  I worked with technical support and on it myself for about 4 hours.  Nothing worked.  So I asked for a replacement.  I was told I am out of warranty and would have to pay $150 for a new one.  Since I was an early adopter I had only paid $99 originally so customer support will ONLY charge me $99 for a refurbished replacement.  By the way, I have a Tap and it hooks into my network with no problems.","Positive"
"2460","I don't know if there is a problem with these, but beware that when you are out of warranty, they could stop working and you are on the hook for full replacement cost.","Negative"
"2461","Love it. Used it every day when first purchased. Used for the news and traffic reports. Some listening to music. Now the Echo even turns on my lights in the house.","Positive"
"2462","I really love my Echo.  We listen to music with it all the time in the kitchen and have fun finding new playlists of kids music to get our toddler dancing like a maniac.  We mostly use it for music via Prime or Pandora, but I also use other things like alarms and conversions.  The sound is great for the size and I've since bought one for my dad for his birthday and he loves it as well.","Positive"
"2463","Also, this passed the wife test.  She usually gives me a hard time about wanting this or that technology but after I used it for a bit, she now uses it all the time.","Positive"
"2464","I initially didn't jump onto the Echo ship when it came out because I was more attached to Microsoft Cortana assistant, I also wasn't ready to jump into the Amazon Echo system. I finally caved in and got tired of waiting for Microsoft to release their own smart speaker and I wanted to tie all my smart home elements together. I have been amazed by how quickly and accurate Alexa responds, everything is so simple and magic. The speaker portion fills my room and gives the high quality sound I was completely not expecting so it kinda blew me away. Amazon got it right and after seeing what Google home had to offer the choice was clear for me and I have zero regrets and I feel like im becoming drawn into the Amazon eco-system","Positive"
"2465","Alexa is no where near the assistant Cortana (hard to beat the best AI on any system out) is but she will handle my smart home well, just hope they both get along.","Positive"
"2466","I now have purchased 3 echos, and while I love having Alexa in the house with us, there are a few key features left to be desired. While the product is a game-changer, Google home has some better features. I'm likely going to expand with a six pack of dots if Amazon can catch up to google in the next 3-6 months, otherwise I may go 'home' since I already have a number of Chromecast devices. Amazon needs to improve in a few key areas (in order of priority)...","Positive"
"2467","1) Have my echos & dots speak to each other and enable MULTI-ROOM AUDIO. This is incredibly important because I already have speakers all over the place (bluetooth, in-wall, beats, etc - not wasting money on sonos) and I'd like a way to play my music throughout the house/car or tell my kids to come to dinner and simultaneously have Alexa disable their devices from across the house (oooh, broadcast mode - with parental controls of course).","Positive"
"2468","2) Let me throw my audio & video around. It would be great to have Alexa help me find a movie on Amazon Video, and throw it to my FireTV stick (which should be re-branded echo-stick or replaced by an HDMI echo puck since it is already connected to my A/V system).","Positive"
"2469","3) Individual voice recognition would be great, so Alexa knows who she is talking to, and who's preferences are what. So if I ask for music she plays RHCP, while my daughter gets Daya. Perhaps - in the future - Alexa can even detect who we are (by the sound of our gate) and do smart things for us.","Positive"
"2470","4) Enable extensions to my network, so I can control Alexa from my car, office or phone. It would be great to teach Alexa to open my garage door as I drive up, unlock my back door for the cable guy from my office, or play a movie for the kids while I'm grilling steaks in the backyard. Speaking of which, we need an echo-outdoor.","Positive"
"2471","5) Eventually, it would be nice if echo was equipped with some more sensors (a la nest), specifically presence, so it can do more smart things when I walk into or leave a room, say hello, and save me money on electricity.","Positive"
"2472","Can't wait to see how this all comes together.","Negative"
"2473","Ok Here we go.  Let me start by saying that I won the Echo in an online sweepstakes/drawing I entered.  After I sent my info in it arrived at my doorstep a few days later.  I love this thing but you do have to realize it cannot do everything you ask.  Take it for what it is...it makes everyday simple tasks hands-free for the average consumer.  Here are some examples:","Positive"
"2474","I love it - don't know why I didn't get one sooner !","Positive"
"2475",""" Alexa.  What is the weather like today?""","Positive"
"2476","""Alexa. Set a timer for 30 mins.""","Positive"
"2477","""Alexa. Did the San Antonio Spurs win last night?""","Positive"
"2478","It can do those tasks without having to pick up your phone or grabbing your tablet/laptop.  This technology is new so please don't assume it can do everything.  Its a cool toy that is fun to have in your home.  I can see Echo having a lot more depth as they develop it more.  For now enjoy it for what it is and impress your guests.","Positive"
"2479","great product.","Positive"
"2480","Great product, a lot of fun to use. You do have to talk to her in a specific way for her to respond and to get the most from her you will need to buy other products, such as ""smart"" plugs that are expensive","Positive"
"2481","I've had my Echo now for about three months. It doesn't listen very well and it knows even less. It even doesn't have accurate information about when your Amazon products will be delivered.","Positive"
"2482","Awesome sounds, I'm obsessed!","Positive"
"2483","One thing about this if you plan on using it with a Prime account for music. Since they started the music unlimited service you can only get selected songs on prime now. It seems that the more popular songs, like Katy Perrys I kissed a Girl, is not on prime, instead you get a sample about 20 seconds long. And when you complain to Amazon all you get is more BS about the two separate services and how to use them. Nothing about the fact they're charging you for something you should already be getting with prime and how this is just another way to gouge you.","Positive"
"2484","I originally gave it 5 stars, because it does work well, it's just restricted when it comes to certain things, unless you want to pay more. But after multiple emails  complaining about this and getting nowhere I changed it so others would know before they purchase.","Negative"
"2485","Really a lot fun besides being very useful for reminders, lists anf music.","Positive"
"2486","Fun to use","Positive"
"2487","You would never know this item was refurbished by the way it looks and performs. Save some bucks and get a great item too. The Echo is awesome! Alexa is smart and accurate. The sound is amazing! Something so small that can pump out that kind of volume, all I can say is WOW! Listen to music, use as an alarm, order things on Amazon, play games and more. The only issue I have is not with Alexa but with Amazon Prime. You pay a monthly subscription and you don't get all the music. Many times I'm only given a sample or a crappy live version of a song, yet when you look at prime music you can buy it. Apple has all the music available for their pay service so why can't Amazon.","Positive"
"2488","Great device, still has a lot of potential.  I will update this to a 5 Star if Amazon goes above and beyond with Alexa.  I really wish I could rely on the echo for more things that my phone has standard.  Connecting my calendars to Alexa and having her remind me throughout the day would be incredible.","Positive"
"2489","Overall great product, but needs development<U+200B>.","Positive"
"2490","This device is very nice and useful at times but the sound quality at the upper levels does not match the competition, not even close.","Positive"
"2491","Alexa is one of the best purchases that I have made on Amazon. We use her for background music when we have company. We use her inside or bring her out on the patio with us. She is a great fact checker too. My kids love to ask her questions and hear what she has to say. You can sync her up to your google music or spotify accounts. We also purchased the voice remote as well, so we don't have to scream commands across the room.","Positive"
"2492","really wish I would've just bought the echo dots instead. Alexia doesn't always pick up my squeaky voice and I could've just bought two of the dots for the same price as this! ( I got for $120 on Prime Day)","Negative"
"2493","Amazing! I love it.","Positive"
"2494","This speaker is more smarter than a real human. Thanks to the inventor of this gadgets. I hope you keep updated the program and keep adding some words that alexa can understand and easily answer the question we brought about. Thanks agin.","Positive"
"2495","My only regret in life was not buying this sooner.  I use it literally every day, to play audible books, pandora, get movie times, get the time, alarm clock, etc.","Negative"
"2496","I often find myself saying ""Alexa, what time is it"" at a friend's house instead of looking at my phone.  Once I got a reply, and was so excited they had an Echo, I stopped talking to anyone for the rest of the party and just had a conversation with their machine.","Positive"
"2497","I just wish she could sing another song other than happy birthday, that's not a great bedtime story.","Positive"
"2498","I am finding this very handy for information, music, weather reports, sports news, etc. A good product.","Positive"
"2499","My cousin got one and I got to see it in action. I had to get one after. It's pretty amazing","Positive"
"2500","It was even better than I expected.","Positive"
"2501","Fabulous!","Positive"
"2502","Still learning everything about her.  Printed out A to Z so I can get to know her.  Love it.  She is my roommate.  Love her  Love her.  Great closest thing to a human being.","Positive"
"2503","Great product but if I would have waited I could have gotten the much cheaper dot.","Positive"
"2504","I love this home automation device ....","Positive"
"2505","Alexa has made the work of home much more interesting and fun for our family. We are super busy and move fast. Adding items to the shopping list is effortless now and the kids can all easily throw items on the list without having to find the darn list. We all have our own Alexa action favorites. Good job Amazon. Looking forward to see how this product evolves. Makes my Prime membership more valuable.","Positive"
"2506","Love the product definitely will  buy another one.","Positive"
"2507","Informative and fun","Positive"
"2508","fantastic ! awesome surprise gift from the hubster for my birthday!","Positive"
"2509","I asked it about the result of the NFL games this weekend and it couldn't understand the question. Both Siri and Google voice search can answer this question, if Alexa can't answer simple questions like this, I think the newly debuted Google Home will literally kill Amazon Echo","Negative"
"2510","The remote is Bluetooth. I had my Kindle Fire HDX and my smart phone  controlling the Echo with the Amazon Echo App, but something changed when the app became Alexa instead of Echo. The remote stopped working and I just let it sit for months. The I wanted to use it again and it was battery crust time in the remote. Even a good scraping and cleaning and new batteries didn't work. The solution is only one mobile device can be used to control the Echo. I'm not sure why but I know my remote works again I uninstalled the app front my Kindle Fire HDX and now the remote is happy.","Positive"
"2511","I love Alexa","Positive"
"2512","Good^^","Positive"
"2513","Positives:","Positive"
"2514","Echo is great for playing music.  I use it with Pandora and Amazon Prime.  For the size the speaker rocks.","Positive"
"2515","Echo is very good at determining which words are spoken, even if there's some background noise.","Negative"
"2516","Negatives:","Negative"
"2517","Echo is very poor at understanding anything but the most direct requests.  Compared with Google Now (or what used to be called that) Echo isn't very helpful in obtaining information.  The most common response we get from Alexa is that it doesn't understand.","Negative"
"2518","Can't multitask audio.  If you want to rate a song on Pandora the music will pause for several seconds.","Positive"
"2519","This thing is Awesome","Positive"
"2520","Love it!","Positive"
"2521","I'm having a great time with this.","Positive"
"2522","I had an Amazon Echo Dot first and loved it so much I ordered this for a better speaker.  My children have so much fun with it as does everyone in the family.  They like to ask jokes, check math problems, make grocery lists, listen to music,  check the weather and news.  We also use it all the time as a timer.  It is nice to use it for things you don't have to stop to write down or stop to look up, you can just tell it to Alexa or ask Alexa.  Beaware though that to play music through it you have to have a premium account through Spotify and we have had the trial premium accounts but not longer.  Without that, we don't find it quite as entertaining and useful.  But to purchase the Echo and then have to pay for an account at Spotify too, adds up.  Overall we are pleased but not do not like that we have to have a premium account at Spotify to use the music feature with Spotify.","Positive"
"2523","I purchased my Echo from Best Buy last month, and I have been using it on a daily basis since then. The integration with Philips Hue and IFTTT makes this vastly more valuable. The ability to control lights all over the house by voice commands is invaluable, and I've set up an IFTTT recipe to blink my Hue lights when an Echo timer runs out (so that I don't miss it if I have headphones on).","Positive"
"2524","I'm amazed at how well it picks up my voice from across the house and on a different floor. I keep it in my second floor office, and it hears me and follows my command to light the house from the back door - a roughly 40-50 foot path up the stairs and around two corners.","Positive"
"2525","I move it around the house depending on what I'm doing at that moment, which is why it loses one star - I wish it was portable. Being tethered to a wall outlet is rather annoying, and waiting a minute for it to boot up after being plugged back in feels like an extraordinary long time. However, that problem will be solved once my Echo Dots arrive.","Positive"
"2526","Second one! I LOVE THEM","Positive"
"2527","Love this technical assistant.  The sound is better than the Bose sound bar.","Positive"
"2528","I love this store and everything about it!  Amazon is AMAZING","Positive"
"2529","Most incredible product I've ever purchased!!  The quality of the device is very high - looks good and solid, and it is!  The technology of the Alexa service is simply amazing, and her skills are getting more and more in depth and varied every day.  After you get yours and become familiar with it, try ordering something you want - I ordered Keurig coffee pods.  They arrived in my mailbox 2 days later!!  It is the future!!!","Positive"
"2530","Love, love..... love <f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+00AF>","Positive"
"2531","So far so good. I really like to know the answers to questions that I have and music to listen to when I want.","Positive"
"2532","Generally a very good product.  Hoping voice recognition improves.  I am from the Mid West, there should be no problem.","Positive"
"2533","I love it","Positive"
"2534","very cool and useful device.","Positive"
"2535","Granted, I haven't truly explored all its functions, but fails to connect at an annoying rate. It's still pretty cool and I will research to utilize its full capabilities better, but has a few hiccups.","Positive"
"2536","Awesome product exceeds our expectations!","Positive"
"2537","I am an Amazon prime member thru my son's account, so I am unable to use this Echo to play prime music.  I also work in a school, and it is unable to connect to my school's server, so I can't even access the internet with it when I'm at work.  It works great when connected to my Ipod, and use it as a blue tooth speaker - the quality it great, and the sound is good however that it not the main reason that I purchased it.","Positive"
"2538","I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  I am not writing for any company.....I'm writing to let the people out there know this is the coolest thing since sweetened cereal.  Oh my gosh!  I love being able to turn it off and on without touching anything, my hands are usually dirty from working in yard or house.  I only wish it could be charged and used without electricity.  That's my only, and very only complaint.  Guess I'll have to figure out away to bring electricity to the beach and lake where my car can't get.  I'm excited about any new developments they will bring to the product and can't wait to see what else she can do.....by the way, I spilled an ashtray and asked her to clean it up...she said she doesn't do that....LOL  Cracked me up!","Positive"
"2539","Echo does all that it promised!  Very easy setup, good instructions and a variety of tasks it performs .  My entire family loves it!","Positive"
"2540","Can't say enough great things about my Echo.  Alexa can hear me from across the room and even when I was sick she could distinguish what I was saying.  I have just started using Alexa and it has primarily been for weather and music, but I am looking forward to diving in more with audio books and ordering capabilities to name a few.","Positive"
"2541","The echo can be a lot of fun.  Even my six year old likes to ask for songs.  The sound quality is ok.","Positive"
"2542","here are more ""skills"" that can be added than I have time to learn about.  The shopping list app is ok, but could be so much better.  There is now competition from Google and Samsung and I'm sure these companies will do a great job, but for now, I don't think they can compare.  It would be nice if Amazon could do some integration with my Roku or Comcast to control my TV.","Positive"
"2543","There is not a lot of documentation that comes with the device, but the internet is rife with information.  For example I was frustrated that the Echo was in my name so it could not use my wife's music prime access....but then I did some reading and learned I could set up a profile for her on the device and then get access.  By that time I had set up spotify (you have to pay for it though) as the default...which has opened a wide variety of music.","Positive"
"2544","Alexa you have changed my life, and you work amazingly.  Just can't wait for your little brother the Dot to get shipped.  Awesome product.","Positive"
"2545","Alexa has become my to go to assistant for questions when I am working from home, it is better than Siri because the setting where Siri is alway on is not reliable. Alexa is different than Siri because it has answered questions that Siri cannot answer it is a different concept. I use Alexa to track everything from my workouts with Fitbit to my shopping lists. Alexa reads my Amazon books and Audio books. It can do so many things aside from kissing you in the morning.  I am happy I made the decision to buy Alexa.","Positive"
"2546","incredible how inconsistent the voice recognition is.  I can say ""turn to WEEI"" and it will sometimes give me the double sound meaning it's doing nothing.  Sometimes it says ""now tuning to America's choice.""  Other times it says ""now tuning to WEEI on tunein radio.""  I never know.  Same exact thing with my other Boston sports station.  Constantly drops the wifi signal (I use wifi when watching Apple TV and Roku so it's not the wifi connection.  In my house, this is a worthless joke of $139.00.","Negative"
"2547","I am the only one in the house using wifi so it's not competing for bandwidth.  I just think it's a crappy product.  And it's a replacement for the first one I got that constantly went to the red ring of death.","Negative"
"2548","Would not recommend to anyone I would call a friend.","Positive"
"2549","This is amazing!  I know this will do or answer so many other things than we have asked of it...still learning about all it can do.  So its productive for my husband and I and my grandchildren have a ball asking it to play certain music!  Fun and productive!","Positive"
"2550","Easy to set up.  Software is very responsive and usually can respond appropriately.  Quite a bit of free music content.  We returned from a trip and asked Alexa if she missed us.  She answered.","Positive"
"2551","Ok so how much do I love Alexa??? Well... hmmm, I cant fit all of my review w/o boring you! Lets just say my whole family loves it. It makes playing music, getting news, weather and so many other skills you can add to your Alexa so fun !!! Worth every penny I would say. I have Amazon Prime so my music is auto loaded on here too.","Positive"
"2552","So far so good. At times Alexa does not understand what is being asked or put the completely wrong item on our shopping list. We would like to see it be able to split lists up more like for groceries, to do, Christmas, etc.","Positive"
"2553","great product","Positive"
"2554","This thing is awesome - artificial intelligence!","Positive"
"2555","Everyone in the family uses this and we just bought a second for the bedroom.","Positive"
"2556","Love it.","Positive"
"2557","The Echo does quite a bit like telling jokes when I need a laugh, converting units of measure or currency, controlling my lights, or playing music.  Skills allow Alexa to integrate with more things or add more features like ordering a pizza with just my voice.  While it would be nice if the sound was adjustable, it is acceptable.  Bass extension is lacking in comparison to Sonos, and treble clarity could be better as well.","Positive"
"2558","I told Alexa I needed a hug - she apologized for not having arms! Love it! I ask her what to wear in the morning and her suggestions are great! We've even had an argument - just what I need sometimes! Am looking forward to learning more. This was a gift from my daughter - what a gift - thanks honey!","Positive"
"2559","This was the first real voice assistant and for a short time still the only standalone option.  Amazon got a lot right with the Echo and the Dot, however they are going to have to make many improvements soon to stay competitive if the Google product does everything they claim.  The biggest issue with the Echo for me is the lack of a way to sync playback across multiple Echos and Dots throughout the house, or any compatible devices to make that possible.  Also it sounds like the Google product is going to be far more conversational and contextual making it far easier to interact with.  Still Amazon is way ahead of the Google in compatible devices and adoption since the Echo family is a mature product and Google hasn't even released theirs yet, however they do have a surprising number of companies that have already said they plan to be compatible shortly after release.","Positive"
"2560","I like the Nest integration, I have two Nest thermostats that work well and I created a group for both so I can change both at once (I wish it could be used to override away mode).  The Harmony integration through IFTTT is nice, although it is limited to starting activities or turning off all devices (I wish it could be used to trigger individual device buttons since I have one IR light and fan switch that I'd like to be able to do more than just turn either on).  The home automation integration is great if you have a compatible hub!","Positive"
"2561","Love Love Love this!  It has provided hours of fun and enjoyment in our house!  We have it play music, jokes, add things to our shopping list and answer maths and history questions galore.  The sound is pretty good and it is a fun device that even the most techo illiterate person can use without any problems.  It was also easy to set up and ready to go in a minute.","Positive"
"2562","It can't connect, it can't stay connected, it can't do this .. it can't do that and I can't abide it any longer.  It's a kitty litter box ornament.  It can do that though my cat doesn't like it much either.","Positive"
"2563","Love it.  It is so much fun.","Positive"
"2564","It just would be nice if it could do more. Internet get anything  but it's not able to seach  it like it should.","Positive"
"2565","I enjoy this a lot.  Great for playing music and reading audio books.  Playing around with using it to work the TV, get news reports, set alarms, all the usual stuff.  Responds best in a quiet room, responded better after training it to my voice.  I like asking who's winning the election and getting percentages.","Positive"
"2566","Alexa is great . . . nothing more to say!","Positive"
"2567","It should have better security, anyone can ask a question or talk to it.","Positive"
"2568","awesome, bought 2,","Positive"
"2569","This device no longer works if you are trying to use it on an iPhone with iOS 10.  Amazon needs to fix this at once or start providing refunds to customers.","Positive"
"2570","It really needs to have more general conversation skills like Googles does.  I'm now leaning towards Google.","Positive"
"2571","I bought this to play music, but the sound quality is meh.  Not horrible, but not nearly as good as $179 would expect.  Alexa is neat, but I haven't really found anything that I really want to do with her.  I have some home automation, but yelling across the room seems silly, especially with loud kids running around.  I have had Cortana for a while and find myself not using that much either.  Maybe I just find it weird talking to a device when there are people in the room.","Negative"
"2572","This is the best device I have ever bought! I love asking Alexa to do something & she does it! Outstanding product, so glad I took the plunge!","Positive"
"2573","This piece of equipment changed my life. Thank you Amazon.","Positive"
"2574","Still learning about the device. I can't wait until Amazon can come up with the remarks for non questions. I hate her : ""I don't understand the question"". Get rid of this program and make a response that is humorous or more intelligent sounding. Overall I really like the product and it great for people with disabilities to control so many things by her voice.","Positive"
"2575","Is excellent!!!","Positive"

"2594","An ABSOLUTE MUST BUY!!!!!!!!! And buy IMMEDIATELY!!! This is such a helpful smart tool that has made everyday life soooo amazing. From suggestions on meals to prep or what to wear and my Flash Briefings to reading my Kindle and Audible, playing my Pandora... I am officially in love and motivated to now buy smart appliances that can sync with my dear sweet Alexa!!!","Positive"

"2599","I use it for setting timers, reminders, music playlists, turning lights on and off, audio books, answering questions, quick numeric calculations.  The voice activation is great.","Positive"
"2600","So far we are having lots of fun asking it questions.  I need to find some time to find out just it can do.  When I can really use it to it's full advantage I'm certain my star count will be a 5+.","Positive"
"2601","Wouldn't know it's refurbed, only that I paid less.  Working like a charm....LUV IT","Positive"
"2602","great buy!","Positive"
"2603","Very easy to set up. I bought a refurbished model, no problems. I also connected Alexa to my Trane thermostat so I can remotely change the room temperature. Be sure to use the shopping list feature and for fun, the daily jokes. They are so bad they are good.","Positive"
"2604","This was a great addition to the family.  Everyone used it, including my 3 year old, who liked to ask Alexa for a joke.  But, all good things must come to an end.  After 17 months of use, Alexa died.  I have tried to reset it several times, and pretty much tried any suggestion I found through google.  I am torn if I want to purchase another one or not, I would have expected it to last a little longer than 17 months.","Positive"
"2605","It's an Amazon Echo need I say more.  The price was fantastic.  Caught it on sale.","Positive"
"2606","This this is amazing. LOVE IT.","Positive"
"2607","Worked fine when first purchased. After several updates, when asked a question 90 percent of the time states Don't understand question or can not find answer.  Would not buy again.","Positive"
"2608","Best investment I've ever made","Positive"
"2609","Works great. Wakes me up every morning.","Positive"
"2610","Best thing ever!!!!!","Positive"
"2611","Fantastic piece of equipment! Love the simplicity and ease of use.","Positive"
"2612","I love the echo!! This thing is so cool, my wife and kids love it!! I would definitely recommend the echo. Just ask it to play a song and it will play it.","Positive"
"2613","A lot of questions go unanswered. Then the internet went down and echo cannot reconnect on its own and was not able to tell me why it could not respond. I was expecting more. Potential in the concept, but not there yet","Positive"
"2614","Overall, I'm disappointed. Although the unit does a good job of voice recognition and listening through background noise, it simply can't answer the most simple questions. Based on my experience, Alexa is capable of answering about 15% of your requests. Ask it NFL team records or any simple search items and she will gladly tell you that she simply doesn't know.  I've become tired of Alexa telling me the things she can't do.  Get used to hearing ""sorry,  I don't have the answer to that question""","Negative"
"2615","Initially I enjoyed working with this but the quality of the build is not great. The top has come apart twice and of course it isn't under warranty. Not what I was expecting for something that sits on a shelf and is rarely used.","Positive"
"2616","Anyone who believes humanity faces an existential threat by AI does has not used Echo.","Negative"
"2617","I bought the echo and with basic things it works great, but as you add skills if you don't specifically as the skill to do something in the correct terminology it will not work. It might not sound crucial, but when you have several skills you have to remember the specific way of asking something it's truly not the way you want something to work. Unlike Siri, and the demonstration with Googles Personal assistant you just ask a question and it does it. In conclusion it works well with very basic commands but very disappointed when I ask her to do something related to a skill which is 80% of what she does.","Positive"
"2618","A+++","Positive"
"2619","Nice! I'm up on a ladder painting a lot lately and calling out song requests HAHA.","Positive"
"2620","The problem we're having is with the app on the iPhone. It is almost always offline or will not load. It is only usable with voice commands. It worked much better at first but has gotten worse. We wanted to purchase some of the dots and other accessories but are afraid they will not work properly.","Positive"
"2621","We love having Alexa at home. She is a great addition to our family ;)","Positive"
"2622","My kids love her and her patience with them with asking the same questions over and over again.","Positive"
"2623","She's not very consistent, though, in listening. Sometimes we can whisper her name and she will hear and other times we have to scream and she still doesn't hear us. Overall we are very happy with our purchase.","Positive"
"2624","Alexa is awesome! It is a great addition to our household, we use it mainly to play music for the kids, love the kids station from Prime. It makes a lot of things easier -- shopping lists, timer, math calculations, games the kids enjoy (helps my first grader with her Math). However, there is still room for improvement -- i.e. when we ask it to play a certain song using the same prompt, sometimes it gets it and plays a full free version from Prime Music, but sometimes it doesn't and just plays a short sample. Sometimes it doesn't hear very well. But we still love having it around that I am not taking away stars because it constantly updates and improves. LOVE IT!!!!","Positive"
"2625","Absolutely love my echo. I recommend this product.","Positive"
"2626","I love this thing. Literally use it everyday and with a kid runnin around and having to cook meals it makes my life so easy when your hands are limited.","Positive"
"2627","Alexa has been a great addition to me house. I've had Alexa since they first came out (preordered). I use Alexa everyday, listening to music, turning off and on the lights (I also have the Wink), using the timer for cooking. I hike 7 days a week and I ask Alexa the weather almost everyday in the summer and in the winter for ski season. I love that I can be in the kitchen and use the lay of something and let Alexa know, and it's put on my shopping list. There's really nothing I can think of that's negative about Alexa. I have the Alexa Dot and another one on the way. So handy and fun to have in the house and very useful at the same time.","Positive"
"2628","This particular Echo was actually a gift.  I love my Echo and Echo Dot, so I got one for my son's family to use.  I think it was a stroke of genius on Amazon's part to open the Echo to outside app developers, so there's always something new to try.  That being said, though, some of the things I use mine for the most are original features.  My favorite is the shopping list; all I need to do is mention an item to Echo as soon as I think of it, and it then shows up on the list on my phone, tablet, and computer when I'm shopping.  I also love its ability to read my Audible books to me when I'm working around the house.  Oh, and the to-do list...and the news update...and the current weather...bottom line, Echo has become a part of my life that I'd really miss, and promptly replace, if it ceased to work.","Positive"
"2629","Alexa can't tell me what color my eyes are, but can tell me so much more.  Alexa is a handy information tool as well as a source of my kind of music.  I recommend Alexa to anyone who works in the kitchen a lot.","Positive"
"2630","Learning to love this.  Wish it came with a free user guide.","Positive"
"2631","I am visually handicapped and this is the best product in it's price range to help in everyday activities.I like how it syncs the calendar and shopping and to do lists with my iPhone.  Finds your keys of phone when hooked up with TrackR app.  Does too much to list in this review.  Buying two more for holiday gifts for my busy daughters and their families.","Positive"
"2632","I am still learning all Alexa/Echo can do. I have not bought any of the products that will work with Echo to turn on lights & other functions. I can get the weather, listen to all kinds of music either from my Amazon Music library, Pandora, i Heart Radio or Tune in. As I am typing, I am listening to the news from NPR. The quality of the sound it excellent & I can hear it from any room in my house,.","Positive"
"2633","Easy to set up, I use it as my alarm clock, weather station, and radio.  Awesome!","Positive"
"2634","Works well and easy to set-up. For some reason I cannot sync my calendar properly. Other users that I know do not have this problem.Overall this is a useful tool.","Positive"
"2635","Got this for my husband and he loves it","Positive"
"2636","I can't believe that this won't work as a speakerphone for my iPhone. Great speaker. World class microphone. Seem's like a no-brainer, but nope, it doesn't conect to your iPhone for speakerphone use. I use it to listen to audiobooks while cooking, and to listen to new briefs, but once the novelty wears off it's missing a ton of practical features. Sure you can go crazy programming IFF features, but who has time for that?","Positive"
"2637","Ok, this thing is cool. Some friends had one, I had to have one too. Super easy to set up and use. And I can control my lamp and a heater. I will be adding more devices soon.","Positive"
"2638","Great sound quality. Love Amazon prime music. Great added features to our home.","Positive"
"2639","Would advise anyone to wait for other devices (ie. Google home which comes out in November) with Echo being the main device on the market it currently has little competition and therefore sounds better than it actually is. 2 calls to customer service and multiple forum searches and they still couldn't pair it with my prime music account. Whats worse is that they honestly have no idea why it doesn't pair ( when you call echo customer service there is even a recorded message saying if you are having issues pairing then try resetting your echo, not inspiring confidence...) This should be simple for them, they make the echo and its their service, shocking really can you imagine Apple or Google products that don't connect to their services like iTunes or Play? It wouldn't happen and that is what Amazon is missing in my opinion, its a great idea for a device but they lack something as a company to be able to really pull this off. Also when i was playing with the echo i was surprised how basic the commands had to be, it didn't understand many questions it was asked which is surprising. I expected a device that i could ask anything and it would respond, to be honest siri or google now seem more responsive...i expected more from what i had heard about Echo.","Positive"
"2640","This thing has the capability of being an awesome device. I actually like it allot. The only problem I have with it is occasionally she says something off the wall with me having said a thing. Other then that I love it.","Positive"
"2641","'I'm sorry I don't know how you would like to rate this song'","Negative"
"2642","I am now addicted. I stream music, get the news, sync my shopping list, order stuff and turn my lights on and off. Thanks Amazon.","Negative"
"2643","Yes, awesome. That is all.","Positive"
"2644","Amazing product..except that is not wireless but other than thay ""amazon echo""is awesome!!!so happy to have ""alexa""on my household.","Positive"
"2645","love it...","Positive"
"2646","Great until warranty ends. Then they brick your product and force you to buy a new one. Terrible customer support. Unplug, reinstall app is only thing they know how to tell you to do.Customer support admitted they produce terrible products expected to break in a year. So to buy the extended warranty.","Positive"
"2647","Alexa Echo is an interesting device. Once I was able to set it up, and that took longer than I expected, I found it worked fine. Now I have to find the best ways to use it. I anticipate a positive working relationship with Alexa.","Positive"
"2648","Outstanding","Positive"
"2649","Love it. Waiting to get more into the programming or have others produce more apps that are usable for things I do rather than things app developers want me to do. Voice computing is clearly a wave of the future so it would be nice if thoughtful work gets done that will increase the adoption of Alexa.","Positive"
"2650","Just stopped working, never was taken outside or dropped. And there is no way to return or exchange it that i can see. NOT HAPPY!!","Positive"
"2651","And my English is PERFECT.","Positive"
"2652","I would rather just set up my phone to my Woburn speaker than use this piece of garbage that doesn't do ANYTHING I want it to.","Negative"
"2653","I love ECHO!!!! I originally bought it for just playing my music but it has come to be so much more. I use the alarm feature frequently to remind me to check what I'm cooking or that my favorite show is starting soon. Checking the weather is easy as can be. Getting the daily news from my favorite station is very convenient. I even have an app that will text my close friend that I'm hurt and need to be helped. I love checking on the status of my orders from Amazon (my favorite place to shop!). The shopping list function is great for remembering what I need to buy at the grocery so I don't have to search for pen and paper to write it down before I forget. I also have a list of things to remember like calls to make or  that my cat needs to visit the vet. These are just a few examples. There are so many apps available that I'm still finding new uses for Echo every week. I highly recommend this useful device and not just for music, although it's worth it if only used for that purpose. Great sound quality.","Positive"
"2654","Well, this is a beautiful piece of technology that has yet to realize it's full potential. The conversational quality of the voice recognition is very good, so the core capability is excellent. However: other than playing very attenuated playlists, checking the weather, and ordering creamed corn and dog food, Alexa disappoints. I tried connecting it to our Nest thermostats, and it was a total fail. Loaded a few skills, but none of them really work as expected. I feel like we have a toddler or a new puppy in the house. There is tremendous potential, but she's not very smart or capable yet...","Positive"
"2655","bought the echo and a battery base.... then amazon adds full time tap alexa command recognition... dang.","Positive"
"2656","Love my Echo! Got this on Prime day! Use it all the time to listen to music and listen to news. It has become my second alarm clock! I got have smart devices in my home yet but when I do this is going to be awesome to be able to control them.","Positive"
"2657","Just a great piece of technology that is now a staple for our household.","Positive"
"2658","Love it.","Positive"
"2659","The Echo has so many features it is very difficult to use out of the box.  They should include one of the books that can educate the user.  The Echo also pushes the user to join Amazon Prime to enable all of the features.  At this point I am exploring  Prime, trying to establish if  it is worth the fees.","Negative"
"2660","The whole house LOVES our echo. The speaker quality is amazing given the relative small size. It is very easy to set up and use. Best Christmas gift to date!","Positive"
"2661","I love my Echo!!!","Positive"
"2662","Alexa is amazing she does alot of stuff and I can't wait to see what they come up with next.","Negative"
"2663","Alexa is mostly another marketing gimmick to get you to buy additional items such as Prime music or expensive wifi Alexa controlled thermostats, etc. Or the stand that only takes up more counter space and collects dust. Many of the requests you make to Alexa only responds with ""can't answer that, go to my app or this song request requires Prime music"". Also the device can't answer many simple questions that are right there in google. There are really only a few useful things Alexa does without added expense. Set a timer (so you don't have to push microwave buttons)  shuffle music, and check the temp. outside. The concept is great but the current model is way too restrictive right out of the box.","Positive"
"2664","So Far So Good. I really don't have any big negatives to say, I mean Alexa struggles to understand some easy questions but other than that she does exactly what she is supposed to. Excellent sound quality and runs (specific) smart home devices, Highly Recommend the Echo for anyone looking for a bluetooth speaker that does more than just playing music.","Positive"
"2665","Bought as xmas present, lots of fun, great device","Positive"
"2666","I purchased three of these as Christmas gifts and everyone including myself love them.","Positive"
"2667","No stars. It worked great until March 13. It started getting really choppy with Amazon streaming music playback.  I thought maybe it was having a bad day, or my internet was. Pandora streamed fine, movies streamed fine on my smart tv. The next day it still sucked. I went to return it. Turns out the last day it was eligible for returns was March 12. The day after it's eligible to be returned, performance degrades so it is useless to stream music, which is 90% of the reason I got it. Boo Amazon. Seriously, boo.","Positive"
"2668","Perfect","Positive"
"2669","I bought my ECHO to function primarily as an alarm clock. Amazon advertises that it can do this. Unfortunately Amazon didn't mention that there was a known issue with the time not always being correct. When daylight savings time went into effect my alarm never went off causing me to be late for work. Customer service was prompt and admitted to there being a problem, but only gave the general ""we are working on the problem, but have no idea how long it will take to fix.""  As an alarm clock Echo is a 1 star because I can't trust it. The second star is because it's nice as a music source. Though on rare occasions it refuses to play. Echo also can't hear commands when the volume is to high, negating voice commands as an option. Nice idea, but needs work.","Positive"
"2670","Very nice. No one needs one but it sure is fun having one","Positive"
"2671","A useful addition to the house.","Positive"
"2672","So far I love my Echo. It pairs nicely with my TP-Link light bulbs and has a decent speaker for listening to Pandora. I especially love all of the different skills; from adventure games, to jokes, to pick-up lines. The only thing I could do without is the need to repeat myself much of the time. If I wanted to repeat myself I would have a husband and kids....","Positive"
"2673","I love, love my Amazon Echo! It is both informative and entertaining. I especially like playing my Prime Music. I think the music sounds great. I would advise getting the remote, it makes it a lot easier, at least for me. Buy, it you will love it!","Positive"
"2674","Really need to work on simple Bing searches to compete with google. Other than that meets expectations.","Positive"
"2675","Love love love! So glad I purchased !!","Positive"
"2676","Love Alexa. !!!!!","Positive"
"2677","Love it","Positive"
"2678","I don't feel like it warrants the money. All we use her for is to listen to music. Half the time she can't understand us or the question we ask she sends us to Bing (which I could do that). Not worth the money or the time. I'd rather not have anything then this.","Positive"
"2679","Does exactly what it said. Don't use it as much as I though we would,but entertained my daughter enough to justify buying it","Positive"
"2680","This is really cool! I've had it for 1day I and can't stop asking it questions. It's a lot of fun and entertaining! Glad I bought it.","Positive"
"2681","Loved it!","Positive"
"2682","GREAT GIFT!!!","Positive"
"2683","The whole family is enjoying asking Alexa questions.  Great product!","Positive"
"2684","love it! Use it mainly for music but its an awesome unit","Positive"
"2685","Just added wifi enabled lights in our house -- just to see if Alexa's ""user interface"" was as easy as I hoped it would be.  It is. I have, subsequently, ordered additional lighting -- and am using bulbs that do NOT require a hub.  The cool thing is, I can control my lights with Alexa AND when I'm not at home I can control the lights with my smartphone.","Positive"
"2686","Best electronic I bought!!!!!  Love Alexa!!!  Can't believe all she can do!!!","Positive"
"2687","So far, so good.  I really need to optimize its usage so I've changed from the main living room to the kitchen/breakfast nook where my family spends most of their time.","Positive"
"2688","like it a lot but need more up dates to be great","Positive"
"2689","Sent back... paranoid about surveillance!","Negative"
"2690","It's a really good device, but I think still needs to have more features in terms of other countries, I'm from Argentina and I cann't  set my address in order to receive the local whether which is basic.","Positive"
"2691","Haven't really found a great need for it.","Positive"
"2692","We like our Echo, however,  there are a lot of commands/questions Alexa can't answer or understand.  The Echo's speaker is good.","Positive"
"2693","I have the echo and the dot. I love them both until lately when I ask for a particular radio that I used to get with no problem now all it does is bring up a rap station. I have unplugged and reset and done everything and can't solve the problem. Don't know who to contact.","Positive"
"2694","Bought for my son, they really enjoy this.","Positive"
"2695","GREAT","Positive"
"2696","What can i say We love Alexa","Positive"
"2697","I'm just going to say ditto to all of the positive reviews. So much has been said, don't need to repeat. Will add this...my family really enjoys the magic door. We sit together and listen to the story and take turns telling it where to go next. Great way to spend some quality time together with a story!","Positive"
"2698","Note to Amazon...more skills like that would be excellent. Skills that can be done with friends and family not just simple answers to questions. Thanks!","Positive"
"2699","We spent over three hours trying to get our Echo to connect to our wi-fi network and register it with Amazon.  Apparently some people get lucky, but we finally gave up.  The instructions are not adequate and you should not have to search the internet for clues like a Pokemon Go player when setting up a device like this.  If it doesn't connect right away you are screwed.  We threw ours in the trash since we didn't think it should go in any of the recycling bins.","Positive"
"2700","Bought it has a gift for my wife.....she loves it","Positive"
"2701","Love my Echo!","Positive"
"2702","much fun","Positive"
"2703","Product arrived in mint condition, shipping was suppose to be one day shipping but arrived 3 days late, Alexa app is un responsive and crashes frequently causing me to have to uninstall and reinstall to work properly. Other than that amazing product, speakers are very good and surprising for such small size, bass and treble are balanced.","Positive"
"2704","Outstanding and lots of fun and help!","Positive"
"2705","Great product.","Positive"
"2706","Works great. still figuring out the features.","Positive"
"2707","Everything is great but please do something with the phone calls we need it","Positive"
"2708","Love the Amazon Echo.  When buying through Amazon you get regular updates as to what's new and available.  Definitely purchase through Amazon Prime.","Positive"
"2709","The programing screw up around daylight savings changeover is just beyond understanding. My unit did not make the changeover at 2am like all of my other devices so my alarm didn't go off in the morning to wake me up. Luckily I had another device set to wake me for work that day. Later when I investigated the error I discovered that my timezone had been erased so when I attempted to set the timezone it would not allow me. Apparently there is a time zone for America and a time zone for US. If you select America you will consistently get your time zone reset. If you live in the US you must select US for your country. When I asked text support what country America was I did not really get any sort of answer. I find that such an incredible oversight and amateurish mistake that I just can't seem to wrap my head around it. This is the kind of crap that happens when you source your programming work out to a third world country. I certainly hope Amazon can address this not just short term but long-term if they hope to maintain their hold on the AI device market. That being said other than this current issue that was resolved I really do like my echo device.","Positive"
"2710","We love our echo....Don't know how I lived without it.  My husband made fun of me for wanting this and now he uses it even more than me!!!","Positive"
"2711","I bought this one for my daughter.  It works great and she loves it","Positive"
"2712","Somewhat limited in music, but overall petty good.","Negative"
"2713","When you take the lighting and heating controls out of the equation, it's basically a hands free version of Siri.  Does that justify the cost?  Probably not, but it's a neat gizmo.  I use the device primarily for the timer feature when cooking in the kitchen.  I also like how she'll play Pandora, provide the weather.","Positive"
"2714","This item is very basic and is really just a stereo. Never answers the questions you ask.","Positive"
"2715","Great for all the current and future capabilities.","Positive"
"2716","Very very awesome product. It has crisp sound and it's very easy to set up. I had it set up within 7 minutes of receiving it. It can tell you anything you want to know and the sound is so amazing I can't stress it enough. It's worth the money very happy with it.","Positive"
"2717","I <3 Alexa.  This is a fantastic product.  I have been very happy with how it works.  Her continued learning and programming is an added bonus I didn't expect.  Very easy to use and setup.  The software is also very easy to use.","Positive"
"2718","We are loving our Echo. Very useful and so much fun.","Positive"
"2719","Love it!","Positive"
"2720","Alexa is very helpful.  Just ask away and she'll give you an answer.","Positive"
"2721","Awesome product.","Positive"
"2722","Easy to use, great sound and a helpful item to have around the house.  Will be buying another for our master bedroom","Positive"
"2723","I LOVE this product , easy to set up , and alexa is so helpful! There is not one regret from this purchase!","Positive"
"2724","Great stuff!","Positive"
"2725","I waited to leave a honest and fair review, I wanted to get past the hype and the ravings of my friends to find out what Alexa can do for me ms Average a non Amazon Prime account holder.  Great for news and weather, quick checking facts, shopping lists and timers for cooking, radio stations.  Music well you might end up spending more to join Amazon music, I use Spotify managed to work how to make it work on her myself, audio books... again join as a prime if you want that function.  I don't need her turning lights on, etc","Positive"
"2726","great product at a great price","Positive"
"2727","It's a fun product, but not a must have - the app","Positive"
"2728","Needs some serious work can be very frustrating closing out on you and isn't ms average friendly.  All in all I enjoy her company.","Positive"
"2729","amazing.i use it every day love music and the sound is great. wish I had one years ago.","Positive"
"2730","Love our Alexa... she talks out of the blue... does not always get it right, but I have faith it will get better with time. I do enjoy shopping list, calendar, todo list, and list to any music in all rooms... the timers too! It's endless! When I need to spell a word I just ask my gal. Had a few strokes so I rely on her so much and she helps me through my days... very happy!","Positive"
"2731","So good even the CIA uses it! :]","Positive"
"2732","Purchased as a gift.  Receiver seems very happy with it.","Positive"
"2733","This was a gift for a friend. I already own one and knew he would like it.","Positive"
"2734","I rate the amazon alexa a 4 star because some music it doesn't even play for you and says to play the full song you have to buy it. And when you ask it questions most of the time you won't get a answer. [I recommend the google home which is better and $50 dollars cheaper.","Positive"
"2735","Still a ways to go to be very useful but it is fun to have. She and I both learn.","Positive"
"2736","This is mostly used for fun and listening to music, but I really enjoy it.","Positive"
"2737","I never thought I'd love this thing so much, or use it as often as I do, but I now depend on it daily. I do my shopping list on it (which then goes right to a list on my phone), and I can stream my favorite radio stations from around the country (or the world) and listen to great music for free. This is kind of like the classic Star Trek computer, but with a better voice. Fantastic.","Positive"
"2738","Still learning on how to use . Customer support has been very good.  Ordered a book on how to maximize its use.","Positive"
"2739","Great product...we've purchased 7 of them!","Positive"
"2740","thanks, we love it","Positive"
"2741","She can't hear me anymore unless I scream. Has gotten worse and worse since day one with the device and now I have to push the button on top to get her to listen. The dots work great but echo is terrible. Not worth the cost increase. Buy a dot and hook speakers to it.","Positive"
"2742","Great for setting alarms, weather updates and music.","Positive"
"2743","great","Positive"
"2744","Wish I had bought this sooner. Coupled with my hue bulbs and wemo plugs, I've become lazier than ever and I love that fact.","Positive"
"2745","I am extremely disappointed with the Amazon Echo.  I understand that electronic devices do not last forever, but in two years my Echo has stopped working.  I take care of it and other than a defect, it should not just stop working.  This makes me question the quality of Amazon products.  A product that costs so much and displays your the Amazon name should be of a better quality.  A $20 consolation and a ""there is nothing we can do"" is very disappointing.  I recommend that all customers think twice before purchasing.","Positive"
"2746","I absolutely love this! I use Alexa everyday. So helpful and entertaining.","Positive"
"2747","Would not buy or recommend product does not work as advertised  Listed what was wrong but it was censored by Amazon  There is no support the techs are rude will not help I have been called a lair by amazon I stuck with $180 paper weight","Positive"
"2748","I've had the unit 8 months and I've grown a hate for it.  Mainly because it never seems to understand what I want.  I order double A batteries and end up with triple A.  I as if I need a coat and it rymes off what the weather will be like later.  Ask it to order obit fun it asks me if I want to buy a audio book.  It's such a crap voice recognition.  Everyone laughs that I have such a hard time.  I've ran speech sessions and it's zero improvement.  It's in the quietest part of the living room.","Positive"
"2749","I love talking to Alexa!","Positive"
"2750","One of the best electronics I have ever owned. Sound is fantastic.","Positive"
"2751","Most of the responses we get are ""I'm sorry, I don't know the answer"" or ""I'm sorry, I didn't understand the question"".  When asked to play music, some genres are unable to be found or there are limited selections.  She is able to give us the daily weather and make shopping lists for us, which is handy.  Unfortunately, I missed the 30 day return window or I would return it.  Wish I'd bought Google Home instead.","Negative"
"2752","Extremely disappointed.  I have an Echo & a Dot.  I should have returned them before the return period expired.  We have been trying for months to find some use for it.  Sometimes it can understand a simple question about the weather.  I hear it's great for ordering Amazon stuff, but I prefer to verify/compare prices before reordering anything.  I almost always have to go back to my Android phone and say ""ok google"" to get questions answered.  I cannot recommend this product and would like to return it.","Positive"
"2753","It's hard to explain just how useful the Echo is until you own one and start using it as part of your daily routine.  Getting weather, traffic, news,  are just some of the more common uses.  I manage my outlook calendar with Echo and I also use the unlimited music subscription.  Recently my wife and I have been adding Philips Hue lights to our home and it's nice to have Alexa turn your lights on and off for you.","Positive"
"2754","Great for music and such.  Need to tie it to Nest and get some lamps to control.  The beginning of something great if you like tech!","Positive"
"2755","Nice echo, I now have 1 echo and 3 echo dots. Think I'm addicted.","Negative"
"2756","Love Alexa!","Positive"
"2757","A lot of fun, and very helpful to have around the house!","Positive"
"2758","Such a shame for so much promise.","Positive"
"2759","It's surprising what Echo can NOT do.  It reacts to women's voices better than mens'.  Also, the frequency with which I get: ""I'm sorry, I don't have the information for the question you just asked"" is highly annoying.  Strictly a toy with a good speaker.  Anyone with a smartphone doesn't need this toy.  And I HATE that it is constantly listening, often perking up without the Wake Words.  Maybe we should worry about Google spying on us. What happened to ""Do no Evil"" Eric Schmidt?","Negative"
"2760","After  having this in our home for a short period of time, we felt it was way too ""weird"".  The information obtained through media sources that these devices are ""ON"" at all times is creepy to say the least.  Not that we are talking about anything others cannot hear - the mere fact that these devices allow eavesdropping by government or outside intruders of any kind is unacceptable by ""FREE"" citizens.  If we all continue to accept these devices into our everyday lives we are setting ourselves up for a future similar to ""The Hunger Games"", Divergent, etc.  ""1984"" is definitely not part of my future agenda for life in the United States .... all these technical wonders have not been perfected enough for safety within our homes.  I do not even subscribe to Facebook because I do not like the intrusion on my personal life - I choose to share my personal life with people I trust....and that does not include Government and whomever wishes to harm me.","Negative"
"2761","Not smart as I thought it was going to be. 80% of the time doesn't understand (don't know) commands. In my opinion speakers are not as good as some reviewers says, for $190 you can buy better bluetooth speakers. Cannot hear when music is playing or if the tv is on, even if the volume is low. I live in a small studio and in order for it to listen the place has be completely silence. Very dissapointed.","Positive"
"2762","I was not sure how we would use this product.  BUT I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! I use it to stream music, my books through audible and to maintain my shopping list.  It is so awesome to say ""Alexa add eggs to the shopping list"" and it show up on my shopping list via the Alexa app.  We have found a lot of fun features to enable.  My daughters favorite is the magic door.  I like the jeopardy game and twenty questions.  This has turned into a really awesome addition to our home.  I look forward to future updates and seeing the new ways we will use this product.","Positive"
"2763","ECHO VS THE DOT: I am adding this because I myself asked this question.  If you have a bluetooth speaker system in your home already then go ahead and go with the Dot.  If you do not then go with the regular sized Echo.  The speaker quality is pretty awesome in the Echo unit.  I am pleased with this.  It was worth the cost!","Positive"
"2764","Love it. Get a kick out of Alexa.","Positive"
"2765","It's great!","Positive"
"2766","This is by far the best investment I have made in years...I basically use my Echo and Echo Dot for music purposes. The sound is excellent! I still make purchases of CD's occasionally, but that is solely for the purpose of using the auto rip system which goes into My Music, which plays through my Echo and Echo Dot. I haven't had any problems with either the Echo or the Echo Dot.","Negative"
"2767","Very nice addition to our home.  Just wish it was more compatible with iPhone music and calendar.  Other than that highly recommended.","Positive"
"2768","It was not able to answer our questions and we couldn't afford to pay for streaming music with it  We thought all of that was inclusive  But no..","Positive"
"2769","I love my echo.","Positive"
"2770","its fine","Positive"
"2771","Love it. Does everything. Has hundreds of commands that it responds to. I especially enjoy the music collection which seems to be infinite.","Positive"
"2772","Love Alexa and all her daily antics. I'm still learning her skills, but hope to get that down soon!","Positive"
"2773","Really enjoy the music.","Positive"
"2774","I was originally going to return this item but decided upon keeping it. Can be difficult to apply but if you do it patiently it will go up fine. My biggest issue is that the image makes it look huge in the wall. The image is what I expected. The one I got is not nearly as big. It works but wasn't what I was going for.","Positive"
"2775","I tried to train her but we are having a communication problem. I'll keep trying but wish I never bought this.","Negative"
"2776","Works perfectly","Positive"
"2777","I'm so glad I bought this.. makes routine at home convenient","Positive"
"2778","When it works its great.  Not so great if you live in a place where they have Daylight SavingTime.  Programming Alexa to turn on the lights is a nightmare.  Getting the music to transfer to Itunes is hit and miss and she will absolutely not play my nature sounds music "" Rain"" album.  I think you'd need to be a computer expert or perhaps wait a few years till they work the bugs out.","Positive"
"2779","great","Positive"
"2780","Dumber than I expected.  No daylight savings time - it knows when it is, but didn't adjust its clock.  To many skills that need to be added to make it knowledgeable.  Even when skills are added you have to remember the skills name so you can ask alexa to the ask the skill for the answer.  Very disappointing.  No one is capable of remembering all of the various skills' names to know which one to ask alexa to task.","Positive"
"2781","What it does do directly it does well.  Love the smartthings integration, but that's one of the few directly supported skills.","Positive"
"2782","Doesn't understand commands very well","Positive"
"2783","Love love love Alexa!!!","Positive"
"2784","had for about 4 months, starting to randomly wake without its name being said during regular conversation","Negative"
"2785","Arrived in timely manner and packaged properly. Easy to set up.","Positive"
"2786","Great product","Positive"
"2787","I am really lovin this fantastic little system...the speaker is high quality, and the unit is amazingly easy to use and enjoy. We also purchased the DOT to expand our system, and add to our outdoor covered patio area for music and news.  If you don't have one, you are really missing out on an extraordinary system!","Positive"
"2788","I love this device, the functionality, the quality of materials, the app capability. All this considered, besides music, I find myself neglecting it.","Positive"
"2789","I can't hang out in the living room without noise canceling headphones anymore.  If I am doing work or trying to watch TV my wife will blast music on it from the app to get my attention.  It doesn't turn off unless you unplug it that is dumb.  Hate worst purchase I have ever made.","Negative"
"2790","Love, love, love it!","Positive"
"2791","It has changed the way we do things in this household.  My grand kids love to ask for Jokes and their favorite music.","Positive"
"2792","Have had Echo for two weeks now and I look forward to coming home and asking Alexa to play any song I want. Really like using it as a timer and alarm clock too. No problems whatsoever. I'm really, really glad I bought it.","Positive"
"2793","I bought this and totally love it. Saves SO much time. If I want to hear my favorite song, I ask Alexa. If I want to hear the news, it's great!!! Whaaaaa!!!","Positive"
"2794","So fun! Just a great invention, investment and overall great item to have!!!","Positive"
"2795","I recommend the Echo and not the dot because you will have to buy your own speaker with the dot - just more stuff.","Positive"
"2796","I am about to send this device back because I can't find a way to make it work and am really tired of trying.  Something like this should not be released to the market unless ALL those who purchase it can easily access an easy connection. I am very disappointed as it was a Christmas present for my husband and the problem is still not resolved.","Positive"
"2797","Truly enjoying Amazon Echo.  So happy I purchased.","Positive"
"2798","I have a love hate relationship with my echo. I love that it works w smartthings, ifttt, haiku fan and my other smart devices. However, I hate how she sometimes hears me, chimes in without being asked and I have been having major issues w the grocery list. Between adding items online or by the app, data gets lost and that can be frustrating. Also, I do not use it for music. My Sonos is SOOOOO much better.","Positive"
"2799","Needs a detailed guide sent with it.  Great sound and easy to do basic set up but needs directions for other uses.","Positive"
"2800","The Best Device since the cellular phone","Positive"
"2801","This is a great item!  It's functional, easy to figure out, handy, etc.  I can't say enough good about it!  After much debate, I purchased the starter kit and now it turns my living room lamps on and off.  Love it!!  Love it!!!  Love it!!!","Positive"
"2802","Not only informative but so fun to use.  I bought one for my grandkids, and it has proven to be a great way to practice spelling words for upcoming tests.  Being a Prime Member makes the music selections the best.  Lots of listening going on these days thanks to Alexa.","Positive"
"2803","Refurbished on works great. We enjoy being able to ask her questions and definitions.","Positive"
"2804","Very limited function. I need to remember all of the third party app to command Alexa.","Negative"
"2805","My family uses Alexa every single day. The kids love to interact with ""her"", and they love all the corny jokes she tells. I use it to get updates on the daily news, get a quick check of the weather, and to set timers for cooking and the kids homework. We also love the music stations, and the ability to listen to my favorite talk radio stations and sports. This has been one of my better purchases over the last several years. I would recommend it to anyone!!","Positive"
"2806","Love my echo! It allows me to play music while working around the house!","Positive"
"2807","Very impressive","Positive"
"2808","Love it,  but it is expensive when adding on  bulbs and switches","Negative"
"2809","Absolutely Love it!","Positive"
"2810","Great product","Positive"
"2811","Works great!  We just have to figure out all of the things it does.  It works great for a radio too!","Positive"
"2812","Love it!!!","Positive"
"2813","We love the Echo. Ordering, delivery, all went as planed.","Positive"
"2814","Music n sound fabulous! Not as smart as i hoped n was led to believe by amazon!","Positive"
"2815","We have yet scratched the surface of what Alexa can do, and I love ""her"".","Negative"
"2816","Echo is a nice addition to the family.  Alexa answers most questions with lots of insight and learns as she goes. We don't have the home setup to use her other features, so her sole function is as companion when someone is home alone.","Positive"
"2817","Alexa is great","Positive"
"2818","Perfect!","Positive"
"2819","Nothing Special. Does not understand the question half the time or, just does not know. Asked where the Football Hall of Fame is located? Has no idea. Google comes up with the answer right now.","Positive"
"2820","I have both the Echo, and her little sister, Dot. Both work exactly the same. The difference is that the Dot is way cheaper.  However, and that's a BIG  HOWEVER, the Dot has pathetic speakers. I use the Dot on my bedside nightstand, and the larger Echo in my living room. I think you can connect better speakers to the Dot, but I don't know how, yet. So, your choice is to save money (DOT), or have really fantastic speakers (ECHO).","Positive"
"2821","Alexa couldn't understand 6 out of 10 things. Hopefully it will get better. May try later","Positive"
"2822","Its dumb. 85% of the things I ask her to do she responds with ""I dont know how to answer that"" I said ""Alexa, Play some different music"" clear as day five times. Not once was she able to change Rhianna from the radio. I'm going to give it a few more days then return it for a refund.","Positive"
"2823","Easy set and works great","Positive"
"2824","Pretty cool","Positive"
"2825","My Amazon Echo stopped working within 7 months from the date of purchase... I tried calling the customer support and couldn't connect. Since, I am travelling last 6 months I am never getting proper time to focus on these small things. Not sure what has to be done.. My direct line is +1 925-415-0154 or you can call on my India number +91 997-225-2270","Positive"
"2826","But my speak is no bad... but with my anxiety and pituitary andenoma","Negative"
"2827","Like a lot!","Positive"
"2828","If Echo could answer even 10% of the questions asked I'd be happy. Ex. "" what network is Modern Family on?"" She didn't know the answer. Pretty basic.  Stop with the bells and whistles and the dimming of the lights and the locking of the doors and have her answer a simple question.","Positive"
"2829","Okay, we've had the echo for several days now so I can give an initial review only. My personal opinion is that this is an over priced product for its current model and capabilities. The sound is of good quality and balance treble and bass, has ability to fill room with sound similar to Bose accustcs but not even close in clarity, but definitely adequate for most people. There are several issues I've noticed from the get go. Once volume is above 4 Alexa can't hear voice commands. So a remote is definitely needed. ( Should be included at this price point) The most important issue is that Amazon uses Bing, not Google as its search engine, that's not likely ever to change. Amazon is in direct competition with Google for this market. From reading reviews it seems Amazon has rushed production of its devices in its ecosystem too often before they are ready for release. I'm certain many issues with this Echo will be addressed with firmware updates. If you really can't easily afford this device even using flex pay, my recommendation is to pass on this product and purchase an Echo DOT instead. The Dot actually can hear commands at any volume level and the sound is acceptable for music. Again if buying this product stretches your budget even a little, my advice is to pass on it. Wait for the inevitable second or third generation and just purchase a Dot. The Dot is clearly the MUCH better buy as it can do everything the Echo can do, without the artificial surround sound.","Positive"
"2830","If I wrote this product after receiving the Echo, I would have given it 5 stars. Think about it, the Echo is not a tool; I can't see anyway that it can be miss used, or handled incorrectly which would cause deteriorating wear and tear. It is an electronic device that sits where you place it - in your home or business - and it responds when questions are asked. Why after two years, the product would cease to work? After speaking to Echo support today, I was told it would cost me $162 for a support contract, to get it fixed. Seriously, Amazon, you could do better. In the garbage it goes, and I will not be trying anything else from Amazon, ever again.","Positive"
"2831","BOUght it for my girl friend as a gift and she used it every day to listen to music.","Positive"
"2832","I know I've only scratched the surface of the skills available for Amazon Echo. Very easy to set up and covers most of my downstairs area. Currently I use it to control lighting, updates on weather, news, music and podcasts. The beauty of this device is its ability to develop and update and not become obsolete in the near future.","Positive"
"2833","need to get a white one for the wife so it could be in the kitchen.  Music selection of Prime has went down in recent.  Need to link my Spotify to it.  My bad.  Kids LOVE it to play music on.  Will try and re-work subscribe and save over the weekend.","Positive"
"2834","My Alexia quit playing music from the Amazon music library after q couple months of ownership.  I googled the problem and others also are having the same issue.  I would not purchase this product without first researching the problem.  Other than that she does continue to answer questions and will play music from your phone once connected","Negative"
"2835","We have both the Echo and the Tap. Both are great. The sound quality is impressive for the size of the device, and the voice recognition is quality. Alexa is now my kitchen timer, my Bluetooth speaker, my news feed, my traffic update, and my quick Google search. We use the Tap for when the husband is out in the garage and wants music, or for a sound machine in the bedroom at night. I'm impressed with all that Alexa can do, and I can't wait to see even more of her abilities as we connect to other smart home devices.","Positive"
"2836","Love, love my Echo!","Positive"
"2837","I wish I could give it zero stars.  I bought one and it wouldn't setup.  I spent hours on the phone with tech support and it still wouldn't setup.  They said they would call me back with more information within 72 hours.  They never called.  I called again and spent a few more hours with tech support and they finally realized it was broken and issued me a tag to send it back.  They also shipped me a replacement echo.  Guess what?  Same thing.  I tried to set it up, and it failed miserably.  I tried several times and failed each time. I called tech support again and spent another couple hours and it still wouldn't work, so they said they would escalate it to a developer level trouble ticket and call me back in 4-5 days.  Well, guess what?  They never called.  I got sick of it so I got a tag and sent it back.  I got my refund today, and amazon had the balls to deduct $24 as a restocking fee refund deduction.  Great!  A restocking fee for something that never worked and for which amazon never called me back.  So I got to spend more time on the phone with customer service and I was initially told I was going to get $14 of the $24 back, and I was pretty blunt that paying a restocking fee for something that is broken is a bunch of crap.  Finally got my $24 back.","Positive"
"2838","slightly over priced and every once in a blue moon glitches. Does not seem to handle small vibrations while cooking very well. works as intended though","Positive"
"2839","As a fairly tech-savvy person (I work in tech) and after reading rave reviews of the Echo (also hearing them from friends), I took the plunge and purchased one. I have to admit I'm mystified and willing to admit it might just be me, but this seems like a completely useless and often annoying adjunct to the tech currently in my home. I can look things up faster on my phone or computer, my phone apps do a better job than the ones currently compatible with the Echo (including things like news headlines, movie times, traffic, weather and public transport reports, meditation guidance, the whole gamut). I already have decent, wifi/Bluetooth compatible speakers and Echo's ability to have my Kindle books read to me (a feature I was excited about before purchasing) turns out to mean I get to hear them spoken out loud in a flat toneless voice, which is not exactly appealing or helpful. In addition, I feel I have to almost shout to have my voice picked up by the Echo (unpleasant) and the email updates from Amazon on how people are using the device are frankly creepy (I mean, I already know they're collecting and aggregating data, but having that fact routinely thrust in my face isn't appreciated.) I'm glad most people love it (it's the wave of the future, after all), but I'm really sorry that I spent the money and then waited too long to return it-there are more enjoyable things to do with $200.","Positive"
"2840","Love this, Alexa has better recognition than Seri. I have trouble remembering the exact phrases to use to get Alexa to work. I need to practice.... great product","Positive"
"2841","For the price, the experience is same like echo dot.","Positive"
"2842","It doesn't know much at all. I have gotten used to hearing ""sorry I couldn't find the answer to your question"". Very disappointing product that was highly recommended.","Negative"
"2843","Still doesn't work?","Positive"
"2844","We have enjoyed Echo but it has suddenly stopped working. Following the reset direction provided by Amazon has not worked and now the device is useless. Be warned that it may not last. Really questioning the price charged for the length of time that it has lasted.","Negative"
"2845","Fantastic CIA listening device. Records all your private conversations  uploads to the NSA via the cloud. Even locates at risk individuals within the home and automatically alerts federal authorities when you're doing something out of line. This will be a super handy device when the government comes to take the firearms.","Positive"
"2846","Still getting used to it and sometimes it doesn't understand simple questions. But overall we like it.","Positive"
"2847","I love my Alexa!!","Positive"
"2848","Amazon Echo is amazing and exceeded our expectations","Positive"
"2849","Alexa is a lot of fun.  Its like having a friend do favors for you........wake up alarms, specific music, weather reports, factoids.....the list is endless.","Positive"
"2850","Alexa is a wonder!  I ask for the morning temperature as I wake up.  I have her tune into NPR.  She sets timers as i cook.  She's also an excellent entertainer - ""ALEXA, play Bonnie Raitt"".  She does it all!  I absolutely LOVE my ECHO and cannot recommend this product highly enough!","Positive"
"2851","Excellent","Positive"
"2852","Oh my God! Can't say enough how I love my Alexa Echo. I am only just scratching the surface of what she can do, and more skills are added daily. There is no way to keep up, I just pick and choose whats relevant to me. She's almost has a personality just suited to me and sorta like a real person when I interact with her. (Don't realky know how to explain it.) I think in a few years most everyone will be using technology like this as a matter of course, just like how cell phones evolved and became a tool we all take for granted now.","Positive"
"2853","Too much fun!","Positive"
"2854","I love this song much! Just ask for my favorite music and Alexa plays it. Ask what the weather is like when I'm in a hurry and much more!","Positive"
"2855","This device has changed my life, I integrated it with smart plugs.  It works wonderful and playing music out of it sounds awesome.  I liked it so much I got the Dot also for my bedroom.  Echo is an excellent product","Positive"
"2856","Iwish when i pair a bluetooth speaker with Echo music would play out of both speakers","Positive"
"2857","love this item works great and is phone as heck","Positive"
"2858","RIP Echo: July 2015 - February 2017","Negative"
"2859","A lot of fun to use.","Positive"
"2860","Troubleshot with Amazon (very nice people): voice so muffled, the device is useless.","Negative"
"2861","Hardware problem! :(","Negative"
"2862","Amazon: ""sucks to be you.""","Negative"
"2863","We love Alexa!  Since she came into our lives we listen to a lot more music.  The quality of the sound is great for us and she responses beautifully to our questions.  Everyday we hear a new ""PG-13"" joke that makes us laugh.  Our home is >1000 sq. ft. and we can hear her throughout.  Perfect for us!","Positive"
"2864","Cool and fun","Positive"
"2865","I got mine and I just LOVE IT!!! EVER MADE. it so fun to use and very easy.","Positive"
"2866","Thank you Amazon for making the best thing ever made in my book. if you don't have one","Positive"
"2867","your the BEST!!!!!!","Positive"
"2868","pretty sure the majority of people have a general idea of what the echo can do at this point so I won't waste time with those details, and just jump straight to my thoughts.","Positive"
"2869","Its amazing.","Positive"
"2870","Grand kids love to talk to it and tell her to play wild songs, very good to keep up with the weather.","Positive"
"2871","I do love my Echo. She sounds great and is a lot of fun. My mother would always comment on how much she liked it, but they don't have Amazon Prime (they won't do any shopping or banking online at all, they just refuse). Since they don't have Prime they wouldn't be able to use some of Alexa's features, so when the Google Home came out, I bought one of those so I could compare.","Positive"
"2872","Google Home answers a lot more questions, and you don't need to enable Skills to do other things. I can ask it how to make an old fashioned and it tells me, whereas on Alexa you need to word it just right and have the bartender skill enabled. Alexa seems more ""polished"" than Home, though, and with Prime she has a great music library, and she can tell me ""where's my stuff"" when I'm waiting for an Amazon order. Then again Google Home is improving by the day, and has the power of Google behind it. For example, I can ask Home for a flight status but Alexa is lost if I ask her.","Positive"
"2873","In my opinion, if you have Prime, Alexa is a great way to go. If you don't, Google Home is the way to go. By the way, both sound great to me music wise. I have a one bedroom condo and they both go way, way louder with clarity than I will ever play music. I really can't recommend one over the other for sound quality. Both are great, both are improving every day, and you'll be thrilled with either. I realize this probably won't help anyone on the fence decide which to buy, but if the only one you are deciding whether or not to buy, buy her!! You will love it.","Positive"
"2874","I am a huge fan of the echo and the technology. We have several echos, dots, and a tap in the house. We use it to turn on/off our tankless water heater, thermostat, outdoor lights (including landscape lights), basic pool functions, and play music. It's also a fun device with guests that visit and aren't familiar with it. A couple of recommendations for Amazon engineers, please create an outdoor solar powered speaker that I can place throughout the backyard, allow music to stream on multiple devices, create sound bars and other types of Alexa integrated speakers, tap is great, but create a battery powered version of the Echo so I can place it in the middle of a room without needing a cord, work with LiftMaster to allow Alexa to open/close the garage door, and integrate Alexa with home wired alarm systems (not just the cheap wireless systems), though I think it's the alarm companies that don't want to give up their total control of the system.","Positive"
"2875","Really enjoy this item and hear it for the kitchen to living room to computer room.  Good volume in depth for the price. A little tricky at first to get it to get used to your voice, and you have to say it right to get the music section scores for movies to be understood  and played.  Didn't buy the  Black dot and I don't think we need it","Positive"
"2876","purchased as gift for family member, happy with purchase","Positive"
"2877","I use it for music , it goes from room to room very easy. I love it","Positive"
"2878","I've had my echo for a while now and I did purchase the Philip's hue starter set to try and take advantage of some of its extra capabilities. It allows me to voice control my lightbulbs, which is super convenient, when it wants to work.","Positive"
"2879","Love it, but not always available to answer everything","Positive"
"2880","You can not beat the sound out of this cylinder. Lot's of fun.","Positive"
"2881","Alexa not as good as it's all cracked up to be. Poor range of information. ""Skills"" ability hard to organize.","Negative"
"2882","I liked it so much I bought a second echo for my bedroom. Cancelled Sirius and threw my Clock radio away. Alexa is unbelievable","Positive"
"2883","Works better than expecred","Positive"
"2884","This was a spoil myself kind of purchase.  I just wanted to play with the technology.  I'm finding it more and more useful in my daily life.  It is becoming such a convenience that I can't believe I waited this long to buy one.","Positive"
"2885","Not great outside US , don't waste money","Negative"
"2886","Amazing for home automation, sadly the controller settings aren't per device which means you need unique names for ever room as opposed to having a group named lights for each device/room.","Positive"
"2887","It worked for two months... that's it. I'm not sure if it's because they changed the Alexa app or what.","Positive"
"2888","Wish there were more stars that could be given.  The sound is amazing!  The design very clever - works great.","Positive"
"2889","Alexa is an extremely well designed piece of hardware, as is the Dot for that matter. Alexa's speaker produces excellent sound for a device of such small size. The range of music available with Prime, if not comprehensive, is still very broad, and one has the option of uploading music to the cloud to fill in the gaps. Try asking ""play some baroque music"" and she [a female pronoun sounds better than ""it"" somehow] will give her stock 'can't help you with that"" reply. Fortunately, Alexa can continue to evolve without having to replace the hardware (as Amazon and 3rd party app designers keep improving the back end), which is a nice change from the usual technology path where one's phones and laptops are 'over the hill' in a year or so.","Positive"
"2890","While I do LOVE amazon and have been a religious user and frequent shopper on here, I have to admit that I've come to expect amazon developed products to be lacking. For the most part, they get the job done, but usually neglect major details here and there that dull down the potential for maximum customer satisfaction. That being said, I do think this echo is one of their better items. However, my echo was gifted off my wishlist, and if I had to choose between echo and google home, I'd pick google without a second thought, because I trust their brand to deliver while I have doubts with amazon.","Positive"
"2891","The only thing I would change would be during set up - if the device I'm using is already connected to the WiFi,when not have Echo leverage the information.  It was a challenge to configure it but once it was up and running, I'm a very happy camper.","Positive"
"2892","The major problem being the inability as a new product owner is to get the unit up and running in a siplistic way.","Negative"
"2893","We were not impress to say the least.","Positive"
"2894","We have been having difficulty doing and did finally get it up and running ... Sort of.","Negative"
"2895","At the end of the day .... And our frustration level, having being pushed to the point I haven't experienced in many years ....","Negative"
"2896","It's pretty simple now ...","Positive"
"2897","Would I recommend it to a friend .. I think not.","Positive"
"2898","The dollars we spent for this unit .. $179.00 if memory serves me was a waist of time and money.","Positive"
"2899","I would certainly not recommend it to anyone in our group of friends.","Positive"
"2900","From what I've read, there are still a lot of things that Google can do that Alexa can't, but I don't have personal experience with GH to be able to compare the two. As far as the echo is concerned, I'm pretty satisfied with its performance. I really just wanted a Bluetooth speaker, so everything else is added bonus.","Positive"
"2901","Love it!","Positive"
"2902","I like it only flaw is web search ability","Negative"
"2903","Great gadget!!!","Positive"
"2904","I love my Echo. Wasn't sure if I needed one, but after I started using it I am so glad I made the purchase. Great for listening to music, radio stations and old time radio stories","Positive"
"2905","Fast service... great product","Positive"
"2906","Doesn't answer questions as well as I'd hoped, but is a great addition to my home automation environment.","Positive"
"2907","Fun to play with.","Positive"
"2908","Biggest piece of junk ever. Quits working at random. i have opened several tickets with Amazon and they do nothing. They have me unplug the item and plug it back in. How useful is that. The refuse to replace it. What terrible service. Be very cautious when purchasing this item. Be prepared to write it off if it quits working","Negative"
"2909","Awesome","Positive"
"2910","I never read any instructions on Alexa, but she hasn't given me any issue with basic commands I'd expect her to handle. I'm sure she can do more that I haven't discovered yet, but she does more than enough already. I tested out some random commands and she was happy to oblige. I was pretty surprised when I asked her to play Beyonc and she replied ""shuffling songs by Beyonc."" I wasn't Bluetooth'd so I assume that amazon music is a prime member perk. But if I ask her to play a specific song, she directs me to visit the music app where I guess I have to purchase those songs to get that command going, but it would be nice if she accessed my iTunes library instead of trying to make me buy the songs again.","Positive"
"2911","I loved it.  BUT, I purchased it for my elder parents.  They had a much harder time with it.  Originally we thought that it would entertain them with  answers to easy questions. But it ended up confusing them and actually stopped conversation. So I returned the product.  There were no problems with installing or use.  Just isn't something that worked for them.","Positive"
"2912","We love our Echo in fact bought two for our house!","Positive"
"2913","Awesome, usually.","Positive"
"2914","Our house has become a dancefloor! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D>","Positive"
"2915","It's pretty cool... not perfect... but it's pretty cool.","Positive"
"2916","Pros: Too many to list - My wife and I use it primarily for listening to music/radio, asking the time, weather, alarms (which is awesome when cooking) and creating shopping lists. It does those things almost perfectly. I also took a Dot with me to Australia and it was great having a little bit of home with my on the road.","Positive"
"2917","Cons:","Negative"
"2918","- When volume is high, the echo can't hear you say ""Alexa"" (or ""Echo"" or whatever word you use) in order to turn off, so I need to scream or walk over and turn it down.","Negative"
"2919","- It fails epically in comparison to the Google Home for general inquiries. It can do some things, but even for those things, you need to word the questions perfectly or it will not understand (asking for unit conversions (kgs to lbs is what I was trying to get) for example was pretty annoying, it took 3 or 4 tries before I worded it to Alexa's satisfaction)... very frustrating","Negative"
"2920","- You have to pay extra for all the music (and it still doesn't have ""everything"") - another slight downside that the youtube connectivity of the Google Home provides","Negative"
"2921","Setup was a little weird. The Alexa app isn't the greatest but it definitely beats the fire tv app.","Positive"
"2922","- Does not do ANYTHING without connectivity. This is pretty lame because how hard would it have been to have some internal smarts for things like alarms, asking the time, etc (for comparative purposes: the Google Home also fails in this department)","Negative"
"2923","- Did I mention how frustrating it is that general inquiries are almost never answered","Negative"
"2924","- Can't change the trigger name to anything you want - I know, this is a pretty stupid thing to have on the list, but while I'm writing things, might as well","Positive"
"2925","- Does not clean up after me","Positive"
"2926","My main issues with the echo... I hate that it has to be plugged in at all times, with an accessory sold separately to accommodate this function that should be built into any wireless speaker in this day and age, but amazon has a habit of bringing back prehistoric attributes to their products. Perfect example, the firestick being introduced to the public as a means to stream media, while the majority of people already own tablets laptops and cellphones that do all that already, and much more efficiently, and bringing nothing new to the table. There's nothing a firestick can do that the others can't, but there's plenty more they can do that the firestick can't. It's like unveiling dialup internet, in a world of wifi","Positive"
"2927","Honestly, it's a first generation thing, and any cons are just part of the growing process. This thing is really cool though. I hope the next iteration can fulfill those last few items on my cons list... ultimately, I hope to do as little as humanly possible, hopefully Alexa's future can provide this... hopefully they don't go all Cyberdyn on us - fingers crossed!","Negative"
"2928","Great speaker, can't do much else. It even made a amazon purchase I didn't ask it to make. Not impressed Siri is smarter","Positive"
"2929","We have the Echo and two Echo Dots, some smart plugs and bulbs too.  I love being able to walk in and just give a command and have lights, tv, etc. on demand.  We bought one for my mother-in-law because at over 80 years of age it was not as easy for her to get to light switches in her apartment if she had to get up in the middle of the night or when going to bed.  She now has trained her Echo (as we have too) with so many features and smart home options that since her husband's death, she seems to be in better spirits.  She tells us all the time how much she loves the Echo, it tells her jokes, plays games with her, plays music, gives her sports updates, and she can turn on and off lights and appliances with her voice.  The Echo is sooo much fun, easy to set up and link to your Amazon account for so little cost and effort.  Hope you enjoy your's as much as we're enjoying ours! Now if we can just get our local news station to stop saying ""Alexa"" and call it the Echo or Echo Dot that would be great! I cannot tell you how many times they have activated my Echo and I've had to tell Alexa to stop with orders or playing songs, etc. thanks to irresponsible anchor people.","Positive"
"2930","The search engine of Echo (neither the way used to understand the questions) is very limited","Negative"
"2931","Works well. Great speaker. She is smart but hope she goes to grad school...so much more would be fun.","Positive"
"2932","It's blocked from answering a lot of questions that Google will answer","Positive"
"2933","doesn't work well in canada","Positive"
"2934","Love our Echo! The voice commands work very well. We are still learning all the ways it can be used and are excited to see additional features and integration functions continuously added.","Positive"
"2935","I had actually bought Google Play first but returned it because I couldn't use it as a blue tooth speaker to play music from my phone. I feel like I'm still learning to use its features. Google was really good at answering all questions. Echo doesn't have all of the answers. I use it mainly for music, my morning commute times, and weather updates. My kids love it even though Alexa doesn't always understand them. I like the mute feature. I do believe I will learn to get better use of it once I take the time to learn more about it.","Positive"
"2936","Still trying to figure out what skills I need to download to answer the questions I ask. I expected the internet searching feature to be more intuitive.","Positive"
"2937","I also feel like it should have more noteworthy sound for its size. It's pretty big, and it does get decently loud, but for it's size, it should be rocking the night stand. There's like no bass to speak of.","Positive"
"2938","works well, when it responds.  Customer service was no help at all either.  The DoT works much better, and is cheaper.","Positive"
"2939","I have used this peice of tech now for a little over six months. I did not have much expectation and I really tried to take the time to give it plenty of chances to live up to it's own hype..which it doesn't. This product is a toy, and I realize that. I could forgive it if it just occasionally missed a command or went out but the problems have been consistent and nothing seems to be a permanent solution.","Positive"
"2940","The Echo is placed in my bedroom less than 20ft from the wireless router. I have a very stable connection and as a tech-lover I use a range of devices that really test and confirm that statement. However Echo is constantly losing connection when I give a command or saying she doesn't understand a command she understood in the same setting ten minutes earlier. Probably the most unnerving part is having to listen to echo say 'sorry I cannot connect right now, please check the settings in your alexa app'. When it is losing connection 3 or more times a day that message gets really obnoxious and there ought to be a way to turn it off. This of course leads to hundreds of connect then reconnect, power down, move closer to the router,and move anything that may cause disturbance to only have the same problem in a short while. Calls to support lead to little more advice than doing what I already have tried.","Positive"
"2941","This product cannot even get Bluetooth speaker right. With my phone right beside it it will play music for about 5 minutes before it starts wavering and the music sounds like it's coming in and out. My $30 Bluetooth speaker does a better job. This product has been relegated to a toy for my nieces to play with as they don't really have an expectation and are plenty pleased when they get a response the %40 of the time that Echo understands and responds (Jeopardy is their favorite) .The idea was wonderful and maybe in the future a better product will be made, but after giving it more than it's fair chances I felt I had to share my experiences.","Positive"
"2942","sound quality is actually not bad at all, easily fills a room with nice deep bass and crisp highs. though I do not yet have any smart home products having alexa around to assist with the daily scheduling and general questions as well as entertainment means is fantastic. the only reason I cant give it a full 5 stars is that if you are listening to it at more than 50% volume the microphones wont pick up your voice making the activation phrase useless. other than that its a truly wonderful product","Positive"
"2943","I love this lady!!!  At first I mostly used my Echo for music.  That's why I went with the Echo over the Dot.  Better sound quality overall.  Now that I've had the Echo a few months I've learned of many other tasks that make my life as easy as just asking.  I know I've only barely broken the surface of the Echo's abilities, but I'm having a blast as I go along.  My home is open concept and I have my Echo placed in a central location.  It understands my voice commands easily from out of the box.  You want to download the App to your phone.  That gives you more control and allows you to add ""Skills"" to your Echo.  I got it because I wanted it, not needed it.  I still don't think I need it, but I'm having fun with it and does come in very handy.  Especially if all you want to do is listen to music.  Just ask Alexa to play whatever, band, song or genre.","Positive"
"2944","Works fantastically for its purpose. Speakers sound great. Super glad I bought this.","Positive"
"2945","so useful","Positive"
"2946","This was a gift to my sister and she adores it!  I have the black one and I love Alexa.","Positive"
"2947","Works just like new.  Also bought Amazon Tap.  They are both great!","Positive"
"2948","It should also be able to integrate with the firestick, which it doesn't really, but can be linked with the firestick remote, and the remote can be used with echo but the echo can't control the firestick functions. Overall tho, I like it, but there's still much room for improvement","Negative"
"2949","Bought for wife.....she loves it....I use it too...just one of those neat little tech toys....","Positive"
"2950","This is an absolute piece of garbage. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Mine stopped working within a year and Amazon replaced it with a refurbished one that will not work. I stopped fooling with it and Amazon's service department.","Positive"
"2951","Flawless. It's a bit bigger than expected but it's very attractive. Great product easy and simple to use.","Positive"
"2952","Still figuring it out. Very cool","Positive"
"2953","I love this thing it's cool","Positive"
"2954","fun","Positive"
"2955","Approximately once a week isn't working and get the message Sorry I do not understand right now and try back later.  Very disappointing.","Negative"
"2956","Love but needs to know more info","Positive"
"2957","App will not open with the Samsung s7 just spins and spins, tried everything and looks like its a common problem according to the app reviews, I'm actually appalled amazon made such a poor app. Had to send this back since we can't set it up. Waist of time","Negative"
"2958","I have to fight with it for 20 mins just to play Hosley radio. It seems to find EVERYTHING that sounds like Hosley.. but not what I wanted. I ask it simple questions just like the google commercial... nothing. I just get ""I'm sorry I dont understand what you are asking."" Sure its a great looking and sounding device but it is lacking the brains. This was a nice attempt by Amazon but it's not Google. I want to throw it out the window. About the only thing it is good for is turning on the lights. Its a shame because I had high hopes for this device.","Positive"
"2959","WE LOVE OUR ECHO! It may seem a little pricey but it has been a great gadget to have in the house. We use it mostly for our smart lights, setting timers, listening to music, and asking random questions.","Positive"
"2960","I love it","Positive"
"2961","I love it!!!","Positive"
"2962","Best thing ever.","Positive"
"2963","Love it!","Positive"
"2964","This is one useful piece of technology! Fun facts, news, and music!","Positive"
"2965","Easy to setup to my home wi-fi. Fun and easy to use. Alexa can do many things. Play any music, turn lights on or off, give you the weather, etc. Great personal assistant for your home.","Positive"
"2966","It was great for 11.5 months. It powers up but then it will not perform any function.","Positive"
"2967","I must shout if the volume is over 4. My neighbors across the street know that I have an Echo. For the alarm, it can't hear me trying to turn it off so I have to press the button. Maybe I got a dud.","Negative"
"2968","My wife loves this.  So easy to play music or ask about the weather.","Positive"
"2969","Bought this as a gift for our son. Chose this item as a gift because we received an Echo (Alexa) as our own gift this past Christmas. I'm still learning about the range of things this electronic can do. So far, the most important thing Alexa can do for us is read books for my husband who is blind. The device remembers his books and picks up right where he stopped listening last. The next most important task that she performs is music ... when she is not reading she plays jazz tunes for us. I also like that Alexa can start a timer (for cooking purposes) even while playing music. (This girl can even multitask!! ha)","Positive"
"2970","Alexa isn't as smart as I imagined she would be. She is tied into the Microsoft Bing Internet network, which makes sense as Google has just introduced a new information product (which looks like an air freshener)","Positive"
"2971","Not happy. Stopped working 3/2/17.  Wish I could return it.","Positive"
"2972","I like it very much!","Positive"
"2973","The Echo is good for things like playing music (not all, however), weather, measurements, most history information, etc. However, it doesn't know simple things like the calories in Starbucks menu items. To me, Siri is much more useful. Sorry, Alexa...","Positive"
"2974","love it","Positive"
"2975","This is amazing.  We had fun with this in vacation .... nice to have it turn music on or off for you ... it's really a neat gadget and I love it","Positive"
"2976","Getting more intuitive every week.","Positive"
"2977","The Echo is a fun and entertaining device. I can't believe how many things this this device does. The sound quality is fantastic. It's easy to use, and you learn things with it as you use it. I highly recommend it!","Positive"
"2978","Love it.  Use it daily","Positive"
"2979","I bought this item on a whim for a fun gadget. I never expected that it would be as useful as it is. I use this everyday for music, news, and timers for cooking. The speaker in as good as any of the high end brands out there. Due to the ease of use and user friendly app, I am converting my house into a smart home with the extra accessories. In my opinion this is a must have tool for any homeowner.","Positive"
"2980","I purchased this for my husband for Christmas. I love it.","Positive"
"2981","love it!","Positive"
"2982","Love it.  Especially the weather, news and music!","Positive"
"2983","Alexa is great for providing local weather updates.  I asked Alexa if she works for the CIA and has said she doesn't understand the question.  I'm hoping she's not passing along any conversations while she's ""sleeping.""  I talk about my time machine development project and trips to the moon so to entertain Alexa and anyone else that might be listening in Langley, VA <g>.","Positive"
"2984","Favorite purchase of the year and only getting better and better.","Positive"
"2985","This is easily the coolest thing I have ever bought myself. It does so much if you set it up right. It can hear you from across the room with the music blaring. Highly highly recommend!!!","Positive"
"2986","Loved it","Positive"
"2987","I love the Alexa/Echo. I get my weather, news, traffic info. I keep my shopping list, to do lists, etc with Alexa. She plays games with me. I'm still learning and so is Alexa.","Positive"
"2988","I have echo for almost 2 week, and echo gets non responsive. Sometime you keep saying Alexa, but it doesn't responds. Alexa app shows same command in history. Alexa keep dropping network connection while my tv is streaming from amazon or youtube. Not sure if it's a defective piece or what.","Positive"
"2989","So... why only four stars? The range of knowledge to which Alexa has access is surprisingly (and sometimes annoyingly) limited. Yes, she can convert currency, metric equivalents, tell you news, weather, etc. But just today, a friend wanted to test her and asked, ""Who wrote The Great Gatsby?"" Many, many people know the answer to that as it's a literary classic."" Alexa could not come up with F. Scott Fitzgerald and instead of admitting she didn't know, she said ""The History of Things to Come, the dark horizon trilogy by Duncan Simpsin."" Say what??? Each of us asked again, same response. So that's a baffling one. In fact, there are quite a few questions Alexa cannot answer or answers vaguely.","Positive"
"2990","I purchased this system less than ONE month ago and it's already giving me problems. I keep my echo in a safe and secure spot, in an outlet of its own. There's no reason in the world for this system to already stop working. The Echo will acknowledge that I've said ""Alexa,"" as the blue indicator light turns and faces me, but it will not respond to my command. It simply shuts the indiactor light off or, on the rare occasion, it will quickly flash red and turn off. The Echo is connected to a secure and steady network and I've tried signing in and out of the Alexa app with no luck. It has worked perfectly fine up until today. Total waste of money- extremely disappointed.","Positive"
"2991","Found out this was a widespread issue that was quickly resolved. I do greatly enjoy this product when it works. I would give 5 stars if its value wasn't entirely dependent on a system that sometimes doesn't work. I've had an overall pleasant experience with this product.","Positive"
"2992","Loses connection and stops accepting commands since 6 months ago. Before that everything was good, but it has happened too many times since. I'm destroying mine with a hammer/vice/lawn mower and giving up on voice command.","Negative"
"2993","On another note: Amazon has always taken a strong stance on protecting consumer privacy and that deserves a lot of respect. If it was combined with a good device I would probably love it, bit I'm not sure Amazon can handle it. Too much focus on getting the older crowd to like their products and not enough on making good products.","Positive"
"2994","Worked great for a few months, now it hears it's wake word and nothing after that.","Positive"
"2995","Won this thing last week set it up last Friday and seem to be great.. all of a sudden it will not answer a question or even speak at all.. it wakes to the Alexa but that is it.. found this site ...and  everyone is saying they are down..","Positive"
"2996","I have bought two Amazon Echo and had nothing but problems.Apparently there are several KNOWN ISSUES with this device.Support is Terrible unable to talk to IT dept. I love the concept but very unhappy with support. If you would like to buy a device that works contact apple.","Positive"
"2997","I have had the echo for 1 week. At first it was fine. Now when I ask it a question or ask it to play a song etc...it just turns off. I am seriously thinking about returning this.","Positive"
"2998","One of the worst things I've purchased on Amazon. It rarely gets music requests even remotely right.  It absolutely cannot understand the difference in a.m./p.m.  And as of tonight other than lighting up for 3 seconds after saying ""Alexa""  it will shut back down without taking any commands.  Going to get the google version and trash this thing.","Negative"
"2999","great product!!","Positive"
"3000","This thing is a pile of crap.  Haven't even had it a year and its already stopped working.  Just went through three resets to try and get it to work and nothing.  This this is just garbage.  Dont waste your time or money.","Negative"
"3001","I was very pleased with it and even bought smart home products, but since this thing can't even last a year, now I have to run several apps on my phone just to shut everything down at night instead of just telling Alexa to do it.  Super Annoyed.  Super waste of my time and money.  $180 down the drain.  Guess I'll check out Google Home instead.","Positive"
"3002","Save your $$ for something better people.","Positive"
"3003","I try to ask Alexa to play my music... turn on my lights.. put this on my to do list... she wont even let me speak!!!! It worked all this time and perfectly fine this morning!! I have taken more care of this device than I have anything ever.. now its broken?! Its now broken.. I restarted it.. everything.. It wont let me say one word without it turning off after she turns on when I say ""Alexa"". I hope it needs just an update.. if this is the product that came out of Amazon.. Very disappointed.. Please fix this.","Negative"
"3004","A good speaker but Alexa comes nowhere close to Google Home for information. You'll experience minor issues like losing connection every once in awhile and not recognizing what you're saying.","Positive"
"3005","MARCH 7 - APPX  9PM PST:  Echo an Alexa go down with no warning.  It is impossible to contact Amazon via phone, message or email.  After waiting 15 minutes on the phone, they hang up on customers with a recorded message saying ""No one is available to take your call.""  Anyone with alarms, timers, etc. set on Alexa during this down time are screwed.  Turn on the lights...nope. Stop the music...no way.  Beware of relinquishing control of your home to this device...it is hugely unreliable and Amazon is not there to back it up.  Worst customer service ever.","Negative"
"3006","Keeps going offline, past return date and had it for 2 months.  If it's not reliable for because it keeps going offline, it is not worth the money.","Positive"
"3007","I love Alexa.  If you have issues - google how to correct the problem.","Negative"
"3008","Doesn't work consistently.  i reset and call support many, many times.  I would say it works an average of 50% of the time.  Waste of money.","Positive"
"3009","Worked for 1 year now will not do anything will not even respond... very disappointed. Was happy when it did worked we showed all of our friends what a great item it was but now it won't even set an alarm for us. Have tried reseting I and still no results.","Positive"
"3010","Great idea but it fails to render an answer all to often.  There are questions as to the technology regarding it saving information to some database for whatever purpose and that it listens to the home users conversations.  This expensive item serves the same purpose I can get off a free program on my cellphone anywhere in the world.","Positive"
"3011","It's nice to have around, especially when it works. When it doesn't work or its missing simple features (like being able to light its ring up) it's a pain, and the app itself is very mediocre.","Positive"
"3012","Got this for Christmas and only worked 4 months.  Since there is only a 30 day return policy out $178.00.  What a piece of crap.","Positive"
"3013","Works","Positive"
"3014","nice product","Positive"
"3015","Great item!!! Excellent product!!!","Positive"
"3016","Echo is one of those items that I will always say ""best thing we ever purchased"" Echo controls my lights, my heat/air thermostat. Kids forgot to turn the lights off in the basement all I do is say, ALEXA, basement off, and she does it and says Okay. Love love love my Echo!!!","Positive"
"3017","I love this! Sound is amazing! I only wished the alarm woke you up to music! It is absolutely worth the price and more!","Positive"
"3018","We love Alexa!","Positive"
"3019","I love Alexa. Love requesting music. Love that I can tell ""her"" to add items to my grocery list or ""to do"" list. Love Jeopardy app, rain sounds, etc. Lots of fun apps to use with Echo.","Positive"
"3020","After all the hype, this is really just an expensive bluetooth speaker/alarm clock. It has a really hard time hearing commands in a quiet room and when there's any amount of noise, I have to yell very loud.","Negative"
"3021","Everyone that comes to our house is amazed at the wealth of information and responses that Alexa gives. The available add on's make it even more enjoyable. From playing music to giving recipes to news items and facts as well as performing a variety of math functions to reading stories and telling jokes, the Echo continues to amaze me and all the asks Alexa a question or execute an action.","Positive"
"3022","I love my Echo. So far, I have only used it for grocery list, calendar and music. I look forward to later adding light switches and sockets so I can turn my lights on and off with voice commands. I also enjoy the news and weather, as well as having many answers available at my fingertips. I have suggested this for a friend who is blind, as I can see where it would be a wonderful asset to her.","Positive"
"3023","My new Echo is GREAT","Positive"
"3024","While product works as intended it interfered with our home network and internet. Echo disrupted Airplay and DLNA streaming to the receiver and wifi speakers.  Initially thought the problem was our modem and router so replaced those devices and the disruption continued to happen.  At the request of the technician from our ISP we started unplugging different items connected to our home network and once I unplugged Echo the issues resolved.  After two phone calls to Amazon tech support they were unable to resolve the problem. I was offered a $25 dollar credit for a new Echo.  My current echo was less than 15 months old so I thought that was unacceptable.  Will try plugging it back in every now and then and see if there was an update that resolves the issue.  We spent months trying to figure out what was wrong with out home network and internet.  Even change ISP.","Negative"
"3025","We love her.","Positive"
"3026","Love having","Positive"
"3027","Is great. Additional features","Positive"
"3028","Are fun too!<U+2764>","Positive"
"3029","Siri understand what i say better","Positive"
"3030","This echo was defective but we didn't know it. Whenyou speak to her, she doesn't hear. You have to be right beside her. Frustrating.","Negative"
"3031","As good as you want it to be.  Easy, works fine, great sound.  A pretty hefty amount of $ can be spent on accessories, apps, subscriptions to make this really capable.  We love it, but don't use it for much more than a few lights, music and news.","Positive"
"3032","Extremely disappointed with this product!! Almost every question I ask Alexa she doesn't have an answer. At this point the only thing she gets right is my music requests. Would have returned her but it's past the return policy. Oh well I guess I'm stuck with her!","Negative"
"3033","Well we all made it to the future. Alexa is great. I half expect that the NSA is listening but oh well. She knows answers to most questions she can get off the internet. Has a timer for baking. Can listen to music or talk radio thru it. Worth the buy.","Positive"
"3034","My family and I love this thing.  I personally love that audible works with my account on this.","Positive"
"3035","FUN, FUN, FUN. I can listen all day and not have to change channels, rotate CDs, etc.","Positive"
"3036","Love it","Positive"
"3037","I am mostly pleased with the Amazon Echo. Some of the things I like include the following:","Positive"
"3038","1. The speaker plays music at a better quality than I had expected.","Positive"
"3039","Excellent use every day.","Positive"
"3040","4.  It has a lot of unexpectedly fun activities that you can add to it (like playing 20 Questions, playing Jeopardy, and random Easter Eggs like when the response you receive if you ask ""who shot first.""","Positive"
"3041","5. It integrates well with the Hue lightbulbs.","Positive"
"3042","Things I dislike:","Negative"
"3043","1. Seriously, I should be able to give the thing the name of my choice. I hate ""computer"" and ""echo"" but have recently started watching a tv program with a character named Alexus, so Alexa keeps popping on to see why services have been activated.","Positive"
"3044","2. The microphone is not sensitive enough. I have to speak far louder than I had expected, and my room isn't very big.","Positive"
"3045","3.  Setting up the music programs sucked. I ended up paying for Amazon Music Prime and becoming part of my family's Spotify family plan. This becomes obnoxious when I tell Alexa to play something, and she plays it from Amazon Music then I tell her to add it to a Spotify list and she can't. Another issue with it is that I'd like to be able to play any of my music from it. However, I can't play Pandora without also paying for that. I had not realized hwo restricted Echo would be when it came to music. I cannot play my 8tracks lists at all, and if I want to play the music that I own that wasn't purchased through Amazon, I'm going to have to sit down and load 20 gigs of songs up to the Amazon cloud.","Negative"
"3046","4.  The Hue Lighting system isn't a seamless program. I have to do some things by logging on to the Hue app and others through Alexa.  So I can tell Alexa to turn my lights on to a certain percentage.  However, if I want the lights to slowly turn themselves on in the morning, I have to set that through the Hue app. If I am wrong and this can all be done through Alexa, it's not through an intuitive way of doing it.","Positive"
"3047","5.  Alexa stopped letting me snooze. When I got Alexa, she let me sit up and say ""Alexa snooze for four minutes."" And she should snooze for four minutes. Now she only lets me ""snooze"" adn chooses the length of time she wants to snooze for, which seems to be ten or eleven minutes. That's not cool because it's just enough time for me to fall back asleep while I'm actually supposed to be figuring out what to wear today or something.","Positive"
"3048","6.  The preloaded alarms suck, and I can't figure out how to upload new ones. This is, again, my own inability to use Alexa, but it's really not user intuitive.","Negative"
"3049","family is loving it","Positive"
"3050","already had to replace it twice and now I can't replace the 2ND DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. I just threw away $190.00 on a product that will not work after 6 weeks. This happened with my Kindle I had to replace it 5 times before I got one that worked. Unfortunately now, I wasted almost $200 on a product that will not work. Save yourself the money and aggravation: GOOGLE HOME IS CHEAPER, SO TRY THAT FIRST BEFORE YOU WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE. Echo, is defective.","Negative"
"3051","Echo keeps going off , or it says it has lost it connection. Don't know how to fix it and I have difficulty getting help from amazon.","Negative"
"3052","Overall it works fine for simple questions, like the weather, and spelling words, but it doesn't answer more complex questions. Pretty pricey, but I like it.","Positive"
"3053","Fun and informative.","Positive"
"3054","Very helpful and simple to use","Positive"
"3055","I love my Alexa.","Positive"
"3056","Enjoy using it to play music.  Still learning all of the skills it has to do other things.  Overall, pretty cool.","Positive"
"3057","love every minute of it","Positive"
"3058","I love my Amazon Echo!!!  I would not have been able to purchase without Amazon's payment plan.  Long time customer of Amazon and love the payment plan option, hope to see more payment plan options on other purchases.","Positive"
"3059","She works good, fun and informative","Positive"
"3060","I love this thing.  It take some getting use to with the commands but for the most part.  I love it.  I found out that you can connect a Bluetooth speaker that has a mic on it and it works just as well as if you were talking to the tower.  I do wish that making a phone call over this would work when I have my phone connected to it.  It auto disconnects and then jumps back on or you can give it the command to do so.","Positive"
"3061","Awesome","Positive"
"3062","But seriously, Alexa is basically a curse word in our house now. It can't perform the most basic of commands and hasn't learned our preference for pandora (always pulls I heart radio or amazon music). $180 paperweight. Would return if I could.","Negative"
"3063","Cool item but not super impressed. Not being able to have it off the plug is a large frustration. Cool concept and hopefully will get better with time.","Positive"
"3064","We love it","Positive"
"3065","This is our second echo...FANTASTIC product for the family & guests in our vacation home!","Positive"
"3066","We love it!","Positive"
"3067","Love the echo neat device","Positive"
"3068","Had very high expectations for 200 dollars but rarely does she answer my questions.  200 dollar alarm.  BIG TIME BUMMER","Negative"
"3069","Easy to set up. Simple learning curve. Sound quality much better than Echo Dot.","Positive"
"3070","bought brand new, still making payments on it and cant exchange it after 30 days, I feel for the price paid, they should stand behind their product and replace it. The warranty should at least be good till its paid off!!! It starts to play music and stops, I reset it and still issues","Negative"
"3071","Love love love!!! I want one in every room!! So much fun!! And so convenient! I ask her to play a certain kind of music and it's like she is reading my mind. I love her skills. When I first get up in the morning when I'm still groggy I like to ask about weather and news to get my brain running as I'm getting up and then I ask for my music.  It is so advance that I can't believe I waited so long to get one. Awesome looking too! Easy to setup! Get one now!!! I'm ready to buy another for the bathroom... it will solve my problem of having to dry off my hand to skip a song I don't want to listen to! Lol I love accessories and they already bought some!","Positive"
"3072","Amazing!!!! Hands down (literally, no button pushing required) the coolest thing in my house! Sound is very clear. My husband got this for me since we have a 6 month old and he works away from home 5 days out of the week. With just my voice command my baby and I can jam out as we walk in the door! Need soothing music for bed time... you got it! Bath time music but your hands are wet and full with baby..... no worries just tell Alexa to play you're favorite music! Don't forget it helps to have Amazon prime with free music.... but also, you can connect it to your pandora and Spotify accounts! The possibilities are endless!","Positive"
"3073","I decided to get myself an Echo as my main Christmas present. It sounded intriguing, if not quite perfected (which isn't at all a problem - with electronic breakthrough devices, it really should always be about incremental changes and improvements - meaning I liked the concept). We don't have connected devices (lights, thermostat, etc), we don't need to use Uber, we like to cook so don't order take out.","Positive"
"3074","But - we love music. We listen to it constantly. We also love information - thinking about and asking and finding answers to the questions that pop into our heads throughout the day.","Positive"
"3075","We didn't expect that Alexa would be such a major enabler of our daily life. I ask her to set a timer when the water is poured into the French Press for our morning coffee. I ask her to play something nice to listen to in the morning. Often, Alexa plays music from 8 AM until midnight. Sometimes it is to listen to full albums (revisiting the Beatles has been fun!), or a favorite Pandora station (it took a bit for Alexa to understand my request for the ""Tomasz Stanko station"" - but now she gets it!). Right now I am listening to the Boston Bruins on Tune in. My wife and I love the daily news brief - a dose of NPR, BBC, local, NY Times, and Slate.  We ask for and get a seven day weather forecast.","Positive"
"3076","The sound quality is amazing for the size of the unit. I listen to all kinds of music - ambient, jazz, classical, rock - and it all sounds good. I love that I can set several timers at once (helps when cooking!).","Positive"
"3077","I look forward to finding out what skills get added over time, but will be patient - because Alexa has become a very welcomed family member just as she is.","Positive"
"3078","Great product. Will recommend.","Positive"
"3079","Had a lot of fun with this but after 2 years it has suddenly started coming on without prompting and no matter all the solutions I was given did not fix it. I now have it unplugged. I have written the company but basically got the ole song and dance ""hey we are constantly looking to upgrade."" Thanks for your information dummy...You didn't really think we were going to help you, did you?","Positive"
"3080","Great way to enjoy music or news. Love it!!!","Positive"
"3081","Love it!","Positive"
"3082","Even though my husband talks to Alexa like he's mad at her, she still does what he says:-)  I love the interactiveness of it all.  Alexa has become a great resource in our home.  From managing our shopping list to playing music on demand we have found Alexa very useful.  Alexa will lock my doors at night if I forget before I lay down for bed.  Alexa turns on a light on demand or a group of lights when we ask.  I am hoping to pair Alexa up with my Wink to run a 4-zone distributed audio system in my home.  One can wish...  Still researching.","Positive"
"3083","Love it","Positive"
"3084","It is nothing than a glorified speaker, I am returning it!!","Positive"
"3085","Best electronic household item I have bought","Positive"
"3086","Stupid AF. Doesn't learn a thing. An expensive weather station that tells stupid jokes.","Negative"
"3087","I absolutely love the Amazon echo,  money well spent.  My kids love it as well and has become very useful during their homework times .","Positive"
"3088","My while family loves Alexa. If she had feelings I'm sure she would say we get on her nerves. I would be cautious with her and the kids, my son had her do all his math problems...lol...The only down side would be that she is not able to answer every question. I was under the impression that she would just google questions and provide the answer. But for the most part she gets the job done","Negative"
"3089","We love it!","Positive"
"3090","I love it . I'm finding more things every day that Echo can do. It's great company for me.","Positive"
"3091","Very good","Positive"
"3092","Love it, so much fun. and helpful as well.","Positive"
"3093","She is prompt with tons of trivia such as the ages of celebrities, the height of the Eiiffel Tower, geography, and so forth. But try asking, ""Alexa, what is $138 dollars plus 15%."" And she says she can't answer that. Nor can she answer something simpler, ""What is 15% of 138 dollars?"" [We laters discovered the word ""dollars"" was confusing Alexa. She could do the math if we omitted the word.) Google returns the correct answer to our original question in under two seconds--""one hundred fifty eight dollars and 70 cents). So the difficulty with Alexa is not the design of the hardware but the information she can access and/or the inquiries she is able to process. Google is exceptionally competent at both of these, and gets better just about every day in terms of intuitive responses. Google can follow a line of questioning, understanding that a follow-up question is based on previous ones.","Positive"
"3094","I would give 6 stars if I could. Bravo!!!!Amazon!!!","Positive"
"3095","I bought an inexpensive Alexa guide book to enhance the experience as I learn more and more what Alexa can do. A guide book is not required, because it's so easy to use, however I still recommend as an additional very useful tool. You will learn tons more features much more quickly with a guide book. I bought, The 2017 Updated User Guide, by Jennifer N. Smith. So glad I did! Thumbs up!","Positive"
"3096","Alexa! .....no words.....just happy!","Positive"
"3097","This is a great product from telling me the weather to updating my todo and shopping list alarms playing music etc. Can't live without my efficient assistant.","Positive"
"3098","love it makes life easier around the house.","Positive"
"3099","I received my Echo for Christmas, along with some extras to make out lives easier (uh, lazier). We use the Echo mostly for tomorrow's weather, turning on/off the lights and turning on/off the fan we have running at night. I also play music on it quite a bit and the speaker is great.","Positive"
"3100","I do have problems with Echo hearing me, but I have a soft voice so she's not the only one that has trouble hearing me.","Negative"
"3101","Love it","Positive"
"3102","great","Positive"
"3103","Love it not a must have but nice to have","Positive"
"3104","Doesn't hold an 18 hr charge like it was said.<f0><U+009F><U+0099><U+0081>","Positive"
"3105","Love, love, love my Echo!","Positive"
"3106","Love it.  especially shopping list and amazon prime music.  audible is great as are the news flashes.  can't waitto learn more!","Positive"
"3107","Alexa is our new BFF. She makes my morning and keeps me up to date on all that is happening in the world and in my world. I especially like her voice. It is so pleasant. I really enjoy listening to whatever music I ask for whenever I ask for it. This product is a gem.","Positive"
"3108","Love it!","Positive"
"3109","Love Alexa!","Positive"
"3110","Loving Alexa for the most part! There are times she doesn't respond at all which is frustrating but she's great when she does respond!","Positive"
"3111","Love it....","Positive"
"3112","Are you kidding me, how can I review Alexa? She's amazing. Although occasionally she does turn my lights on randomly in the middle of the night. But I forgive her because of her Knock Knock Jokes.","Negative"
"3113","Just love the Echo. The voice is so soothing and what she says is so real. We ask her questions and she answers when she can.","Positive"
"3114","we love our alexa, she always knows the weather forecast and can send my wife and kids off to work/school laughing at the joke for the day. .My daughter loves to play games with her and shes evolving very quickly to our requests. She can control our thermostats on both floors of the house. she can unlock the front door if a friend arrives and i'm in the shower. She can turn on lights programed to turn on together or can just respond to turn on one by one.","Positive"
"3115","So happy I bought the Echo.","Positive"
"3116","Alexa is such fun we enjoy the whole experience.","Positive"
"3117","Bought a certified Refurbished Echo and was amazed you could not tell if it was new or refurbished. Packaged the same as a new one and the performance is awesome.... Very pleased!","Positive"
"3118","This is really cool. Be aware that if you want to access music through it, you've got to buy a service.","Positive"
"3119","1. The Echo forces you to use their software to connect to your router, and does not connect to Bluetooth. This way Amazon is able to track everything you do online, and market products to you that they think you will want to buy. I see no reason to believe Amazon's software is going to be as secure as the software already provided by your device.","Positive"
"3120","2. I couldn't connect to my router using their software on my iPhone. They don't provide a desktop app for Mac, so I downloaded a Chrome extension, which didn't help me very much. I didn't bother troubleshooting the problem, I just sent it back.","Negative"
"3121","3. Because the Echo doesn't connect to Bluetooth, I was unable to do simple things from my phone or computer like adjust the volume. During the set up process, the volume is very high, and I was unable to turn it down. I couldn't get through the set up process however, because my router was refusing to connect through the software that Amazon want you to use.","Negative"
"3122","We communicate with Alexa daily and just love having her join our family!","Positive"
"3123","Great fun for the whole family! We love it!","Positive"
"3124","It worked fine for a while and now it won't sink with my WiFi.  I've checked out my connection and it's perfect with everything else just not my Echo.","Positive"
"3125","Might sound crazy but if your disabled and it takes quite a bit to move around, This is priceless and our alexa does it all without issues..","Negative"
"3126","There's no place to help remediate the problems. If I'm missing some place to help with this problem please contact me!!!!!!!!!","Negative"
"3127","Easy to install, but does require that you subscribe to Amazon Prime.  Not only is it fun to use, but it has many practical uses.  Highly recommend.","Positive"
"3128","Love this.  Everyone needs one for their home.","Positive"
"3129","My new night time friend, this + Alexa. The DH works 3rd shift (lots of OT too), + the dogs + I get lonely. M","Negative"
"3130","I received her Thurs + love her, especially as my hubby guides me thru all she's able doing. Right now am mainly playing music from ""my old days"". She does what's asked when asked. I love playing my specific desired songs. Not just tracks or entire albums.","Positive"
"3131","Now I have control of the music I love, even if he thinks they're ""nerdy"".","Positive"
"3132","It while started me trying out Amazon's ""Prime Membership 30 day trial option + he had me order her + he joined their book club awhile back + loves reading. My music is $3.99 monthly, both loving it. I must read + learn ""Prime's"" capabilities + abilities. I'd started basically for savings in shipping.","Positive"
"3133","I'm technically stupid, he jokingly calls me.","Negative"
"3134","Gift for my husband, that he  loves.  It arrived on time and in great condition.","Positive"
"3135",". Really love my Echo. Don't know why I waited so long to purchase it!","Positive"
"3136","love love love.","Positive"
"3137","Loving Alexa!  So handy to ask her to turn off music or turn on music and ask her questions.  She's a great little assistant.","Positive"
"3138","Love it","Positive"
"3139","Thank You","Positive"
"3140","Purchased this for my wife and she loves it.","Positive"
"3141","Others have reviewed this well.","Positive"
"3142","Mine almost got a 1 star review. Setup goes through steps to get the Echo on the wifi network. It ends up at an informational video which I fast forwarded through. Then, every time I tried to use the Alexa app I got back to the setup, despite deleting the app and redoing it.","Positive"
"3143","So far I like it.","Positive"
"3144","Super fun with great sound. Many great features. Very convenient for getting business phone numbers and addresses. It's like having a helper in your house. Just don't ask her where your keys are, she doesn't know.!","Positive"
"3145","Security seems poor, but I haven't had any odd sounds others reported.","Negative"
"3146","Bought for my mom...now my wife wants one.  Cant decide if we should buy this, a dot or wait for the next iterations.","Negative"
"3147","One has to yell to get Alexa to work after 3 month...a little awkward. Very limited range of service but it is still a fun gadget.","Positive"
"3148","Best invention EVER! I absolutely LOVE my Echo. I use Alexa for everything and it's the best investment I've made in a while. Well worth every penny!","Positive"
"3149","Not impressed but it is an interesting novelty, albeit a bit expensive. Got this because my wife wanted it. My wife (bless her heart) cannot figure out how to ask the right questions so is constantly getting responses saying Alexa doesn't understand the question. She then insults Alexa which prompts me to apologize to Alexa, however silly that is. I use her to play music and tell me the weather but that's about it. Would not purchase again, doesn't fit my life at all.","Positive"
"3150","Greatest product I have bought in the last two years. Have one in the living room and one in master bedroom. This is a no-brainer and truly is an item for that someone who has everything. For Seniors they control or ask questions with their voice, saves getting up to change stations, play lists or adjust volume again all by your voice. What more could you ask for...........? Do not hesitate on this one and do not wait for the price to change.","Positive"
"3151","This thing is awesome. It is easy to set up, very easy to use and quite nice sounding when listening to music.","Positive"
"3152","Amazing!!","Positive"
"3153","Love it! Or should i say...love her!","Positive"
"3154","Love it!","Positive"
"3155","In most ways, the Echo is impressive. But once you start using it for any period of time, you start to get irritated with it's lack of ability to find or explain anything. When looking into it, I found that it's because it's search engine is bing. There is no way to switch this to google. I will be replacing this with a google home, because it's search engine isn't complete garbage.","Negative"
"3156","Doesn't roam on wifi. If it drops for a second, I have to set it up on my app all over again. This happens multiple times per day for me. Needs feature to make and answer phone calls.","Positive"
"3157","Excellent","Positive"
"3158","I like it - but actually about the only thing I use it for is a speaker.  I could have bought something else much cheaper to be a speaker, but that's an issue with me and not the Echo.  Product works great, no doubt about that.  Will keep you occupied conversing with her but after awhile it just became a novelty.  Now I dust it off every so often and introduce it to my friends who come in my office.","Positive"
"3159","Nothing to say, Echo says it all for you, Brilliant","Positive"
"3160","Absolutely love my Echo!  When I bought it I didn't realize the amount for things it does. Very easy to set up and understand. Thank you Amazon for a great product.","Positive"
"3161","Love this device.","Positive"
"3162","I love Echo. Learning more everyday about it's functionality.","Positive"
"3163","Love, love, love Alexa. Now when my husband ask me a question I just say to ask Alexa. She still has a long way to go on some of the questions that I get but she is really great on so many levels.","Positive"
"3164","Love, Love, Love Echo!","Positive"
"3165","So much that I gifted Echo to each of my 4 children!","Positive"
"3166","Easy to set up and use. Great sound!!!","Positive"
"3167","been wanting one of these for a long time.  well i got it.  looks great but was a bit of a pain to set up.  the app was a bit wonky and i had to uninstall and reinstall several times before it worked.  well got it set up and then everything i wanted to do with it i had to enable it through the ""skills"" portion of the app.  i think it should have already been enabled with all skills to begin with..  but anyhoo..  the sound is good but not what i expected for this price. asking it questions are so-so  about 50% of the time it won't know what you are asking or come up with nothing.  playing music is easy but be prepared to pay an extra 3.99 a month for music even if you have a prime account cause otherwise it will only play samples of anything you ask it to play.. and if you are playing music loudly with it you will have to almost scream ALEXA for it to hear you. and a huge huge huge thing is that it will NOT read your e-books as written.  i purchased the game of thrones e-books and most of the cuss words were bleeped out.  i did not buy this to have it censor my ebooks.  they should have a parental filter that you can turn on or off not decide for me!  i like it a lot but it still needs a lot of work..","Positive"
"3168","This was a gift but I got to experience it! I will be buying one for myself! I love it!","Positive"
"3169","The whole family loves it. Prime membership is required for optimum enjoyment. Prime costs about as much as Netflix does anually, but it comes with prime music and video and free two day shipping so it is definitely worth it.","Positive"
"3170","A great option for mobility, Alexa and a bluetooth speaker with 8 hours of life will have your pool party rocking...","Positive"
"3171","Bought it for my husband and he loved the music feature","Positive"
"3172","Wonderful","Positive"
"3173","Love a lot of the features but I wish you could ask Alexa a wider variety of questions that she will look up on google or something, sort of how Siri does it. Just have to be reasonable with your questions I suppose.","Positive"
"3174","Need to reconnect often. Other than that it works great.","Positive"
"3175","There is a much better option available at a much better price.  I purchased the  echo and thgen brought three of the other units.  There is no comparison.  The competion offers much better selection of music.","Positive"
"3176","Fun, interesting, and informative.","Positive"
"3177","nothing is perfect but this comes close. arrived in a nice black box taking a cue from others like apple who believe first impressions matter. inside the box the echo, power supply and a just a few sentences of instructions is that's needed for setup.","Positive"
"3178","Love this outstanding","Positive"
"3179","Love It.","Positive"
"3180","I got this for my husband who is not computer savvy.  He loves it.","Positive"
"3181","Love it","Positive"
"3182","fantastic. amazing that it has no trouble accepting commands from a wide range of voices( myself, my wife, our 4 year old grandson).","Positive"
"3183","Alexia is awesome!","Positive"
"3184","Having great difficulty hooking it up to home wi-fi system.","Negative"
"3185","the echo design team went and made setup so simple and automated a child could do it. you will need to download the alexa app from android or amazon. i cannot say for apple as i left their closed ecosystem years ago. that said once you have alexa installed you can start the setup process or i should say alexa will do it for you. FYI i pulled an Einstein move whilst setting up mine, forgot to turn on bluetooth duh. when echo/alexa told me there was a problem connecting and then told me exactly where to go and what to do to make it right! no need to troubleshot. but you do need the bluetooth enabled so the network information etc is cloned to the echo device and you need not enter any of it in. once that is done your wifi network is set, good to go and so are you.","Positive"
"3186","I was skeptical at first about whether I'd use a device like the Echo, but I must say, I use it all the time and I love it!","Positive"
"3187","Not impressed. Finds only things you already own like Prime. Google does much much more. you can use IFTTT to connect to Google webface but you need a degree in engineering just to follow instructions on YouTube to make Echo work with Google.","Positive"
"3188","Waiting for much needed update to find all this much needed web search access OR SELLING IT","Negative"
"3189","Love this thing!","Positive"
"3190","Have only scratched the surface but it is such an amazing piece of technology. For music lovers - the sound quality & capabilities are perfect. Plan on extending this beyond just the unit itself & will install lights & outlets to connect to the Echo. Hated having my phone in my hands or on me at all times & this solves that. Alexa is like my perfect little personal assistant.","Positive"
"3191","Works great. Have a lot of fun with it.","Positive"
"3192","Love it, love it, love it. An amazing and incredible product...Amazon did it right.","Positive"
"3193","Alexa is great. She can help make your home smart, she can interface with my stereo my iPhone, and many other devices.  The only reason I did not give her five stars, is that she does not hear too well I'm far away. Also, I wish this unit what the hell, with the option of being wireless.","Positive"
"3194","Really like the product.  I especially like how you have the app to interface with the echo things like the shopping list.  We're still discovering new things about it but we do love our Echo!","Positive"
"3195","I can't help but think that a collaboration  between Google and Amazon in developing Alexa would have been brilliant. Yes, I know that Amazon wants to keep its customers snugly enfolded in Amazon World, which no doubt is considered a wise business strategy, and is reminiscent of Apple's closed ecosphere. But just imagine what Alexa could do if Google provided the brains behind it. Given Alexa's limitation, we may well switch to Google Home, but for now, Alexa and her two ""sister"" Dots are providing good music and can answer many questions indeed. We have no need of smart home functions--I can certainly change the thermostat myself, and turn lights on and off. Who really needs that? Some of us recall when we had to get up and change the CHANNEL on the TV. Manually!","Positive"
"3196","little things i like about the echo;","Positive"
"3197","I like listening to music, and I have an Audible library.  This product has speakers that are very clear and the volume adjust so easily.  It is nice to be able to tell Alex to play music, books or ask about the weather.  I am really enjoying the reminder feature.","Positive"
"3198","I am trying to like you, Alexa, but you just won't let me! You worked fine for two months and now you won't connect to WIFI no matter what we try! Our relationship was short-lived. I enjoyed our musical mornings as I got ready for work. You gave me accurate weather conditions so I could dress appropriately. But now, your magic blue light doesn't show for me anymore. I suspect that you might be two-timing me with the neighbor's WIFI, but I can't tell. So long, Alexa; I am sending you back to Amazon.","Positive"
"3199","I love my Alexa...when she works.  She seems to have a ""hard time understanding right now"" a lot.  About every 9-20 minutes she kicks onher red light and is not available.  I know I have less than stellar broadband width.  I tried to connect Lifx lights and they were just to much to support so now I am trying to return those to the company.  It seems like ever since we got the Lifx lights my Alexa has connectivity issues.  Has anyone else had this problem?  Any suggestions?  The lights are back in the boxes.  So I figured Alexa would go back to fully operational but she hasn't.  I constantly have to unplug her and plug her back in or do a complete set up again to make her work.  Even then, she still only lasts for about 20 minutes max.","Positive"
"3200","I have 2 Alexa's. Love this thing. I also like that when she doesn't provide info I ask for I can send notice to Amazon and the department who checks those deficiencies out investigates how to improve the Alexa.","Positive"
"3201","Going to be a birthday gift","Positive"
"3202","This thing is amazing.  Alexa has become a member of our family.  Worth every penny just for the weather, time, spelling, dictionary and music.  I haven't explored all her uses but I love the Amazon Echo.  P.S.  the little Dots are great but for music and sound quality go for the the Echo.","Positive"
"3203","I hear ""I don't understand the question"" a lot. It is getting better, or I am getting better at asking the question. Information is good, but has a ways to go.","Positive"
"3204","I have hooked this to my smartthings hub and it works great. We turn our house lights on and off when our hands are full and my 5 year old loves talking to Alexa! She plays him music and tells bedtime stories... he just loves her! Linked to pandora as well. Planning on extending network and getting a dot for the bedroom. I even followed online posts and linked her to google!","Positive"
"3205","Love it!!!","Positive"
"3206","Fun device. Love playing music through it, granted to make the most of it we had to buy the Amazon music unlimited. Also having only one person's Amazon account to control all the skills is a bit frustrating. And god forbid you have an accent (husband is Australian), it gets either hilarious or frustrating at times. But I can never go back for the pure fact alone that she can turn my bedroom lights off without me getting out of bed on a cold winters night.","Positive"
"3207","1 - feels well made, like everything else we've purchased made by amazon","Positive"
"3208","I don't think it's worth the price I paid for it. A tutorial on all of its functions would be nice.","Positive"
"3209","I enjoy the convenience of the echo but too often it responds with, ""I didn't understand the question"". I pose the same question to Siri on my IPhone and usually get an answer.","Positive"
"3210","Purchased to replace Vizio Crave 360 that was difficult to pair. The Echo pairs every time and stays paired. Sound is not as good as the Crave so I dinged one star.","Negative"
"3211","I Love my echo.","Positive"
"3212","this thing is GREAT!!!! love it!!!!","Positive"
"3213","LOVE IT!!!","Positive"
"3214","Fun fun fun. Its no joke that this thing learns how you speak.. our 4yr old couldnt get Alexa to obey commands at first.. but now after a few days, Alexa listens to her and knows what she is asking for (mostly Katy Perry songs). We have added a bunch of skills and cant wait to see what else she can do.","Positive"
"3215","What can I say that hasn't already been said?! Alexa has changed my life for the better! I use it for so many different things!","Positive"
"3216","Every morning I ask her the weather and what traffic is going to be like for my commute to work. Awesome.","Positive"
"3217","2 - the rotating light bar atop is really cool & instructive","Positive"
"3218","Unlike my wife, she is extremely handy in the kitchen, setting multiple timers and converting measurements with ease! One of my favorite features is telling her to add items to my shopping list which I can then pull up with my Alexa app!","Positive"
"3219","I am also utilize her as a smart hub to control different connected devices in my home.  I can command her to turn the temperature up or down on my Nest thermostat and control the lights in every room in my house, integrating with the Phillips hue system.","Positive"
"3220","She also tells jokes, streams music from all your favorite streaming services and so much more!","Positive"
"3221","Maybe the best thing about Alexa is that she keeps getting smarter and adding skills all the time!","Positive"
"3222","I would say that this product is on its way to becoming a need, and not a want.","Positive"
"3223","I love this my kids are enjoying the endless knowledge and music definitely a lot of help to keep our house running","Positive"
"3224","Love it!","Positive"
"3225","Love it.  Use it all the time.  My granddaughter asked her mom why she always had to say please and thank you to ALEXA.  The answer was it teaches you to always do it in every day life.","Positive"
"3226","Amazed at the thing Echo & Alexa do.","Positive"
"3227","Love echo use it for news, local wheather, music, question, and many other things","Positive"
"3228","3 - the sound is nice and rich","Positive"
"3229","Ok I have been looking at these Echo's for a few months.  The other night I worked a 13 hour shift and my husband started asking me questions about the weather, news, etc over dinner.  My brain was so tired I just couldn't even answer him.  While shopping for that perfect anniversary gift I thought BOMB!!!! The Echo!!! Perfect no more questions after a long hard day.  I received the Echo the next day and set it up.  I am already wondering how my life survived without this Echo.  It tells you everything.  We love it.  My husband is a musician and he just tells it to play a song and Alexa does it....no thinking.  I am using it in the kitchen but can ask it anything in the bedroom and livingroom and it answers.  I love it!!!!  Thanks Amazon for the Prime!!! good music, books, shipping etc.... oh yea Alexa does audio books too!!!","Positive"
"3230","Hoping Alexa wil learn more quickly,and have better understanding and response. As long as we're not giving rise to Skynet,I'm happy so far!","Positive"
"3231","It was a gift to my wife and she loves it.","Positive"
"3232","Really love Amazon echo!! Great product and love all that it can do. Hope they keep updating it!","Positive"
"3233","Love Echo","Positive"
"3234","If Alexa stops working properly, try unpluging her from electric, to reboot her.","Positive"
"3235","So far I've had this unit for about 2 months and love almost everything about it and what it can do, although I'm sure I've barely scratched the surface of options! The sound on this is amazing compared to the echo dot that I purchased first. After trying out the idea with the dot I decided to invest in the more expensive big sister for the speakers as I listen to this while cleaning the house now. I'm not disappointed in any way. I will say for disclosure sake that I'm not a major audio geek that would normally pay a lot more for the ""best"" sound. all in all for the extra $ it was worth it to me! I've added several wifi outlets to my house and have it integrated with my thermostat as well. Now I'm catching the ""bug"" to look at where else I can integrate this into my home automation!","Positive"
"3236","Still learning what she can do.  But we are enjoying her","Positive"
"3237","Family uses it every day and loves it.","Positive"
"3238","We really have fun with echo. Must keep learning about all the things it can do. New items are added often for it to do.","Positive"
"3239","4 - constant improvements made by the device as it learns as well as amazon on app developers making it even better week to week those are just a few of the many things i like about the echo and the alexa software behind it. there are so many other aspects that are found  repeatedly in the thousands of positive reviews for this device.","Positive"
"3240","17 attempts to connect to wifi. Performed every hard reset and re-connect maneuver without success. Had to send back to Amazon. Something about dual band wifi incompatibility. Every other device I own (2 iPads, an iPhone, and an iMac) connect seamlessly to wifi. Amazon needs their engineers to work on the Echo software a little more.","Positive"
"3241","I asked Amazon if you had to be a prime member to use echo and they said no.  What they didn't tell me is that you will be unable to use MANY FEATURES if you are not a prime member.","Positive"
"3242","I Love the echo so much I play a lot of music on it and other things and Thanks Amazon for the 5 payment plan","Positive"
"3243","I would like to return this item.  Please advise how to return for refund.  Thank you.","Positive"
"3244","As expected.  No issues to item or packaging.","Negative"
"3245","All its been is an expensive speaker. We have down loaded items to. But when you ask it a question. It says sorry i dont understand. I did the exchange or subistute item for cooking. I asked what can i use instead of 1 tablespoon butter. Just says sorry. I dont understand your question. But it is a good speaker when it plays right and not keep on stopping. Was hoping for better then what we have.","Positive"
"3246","It's the greatest","Positive"
"3247","There is learning curve on how to structure questions but works great!","Positive"
"3248","Product is as expected.  What don't have is a good list of commands.  Had to go on line to find and even then I still have some issues with what it can and cannot do","Positive"
"3249","things i don't like about the echo;","Positive"
"3250","Bought for a client who has limited hand use.  Perfect.","Positive"
"3251","Not a very dependable item its either hit or miss. I am thinking of selling mine not what I expected.","Positive"
"3252","perfect","Positive"
"3253","Like it - but, NLP capabilities are weaker than expected.","Negative"
"3254","This device has transformed our main living space. I listen to the news. My daughter listens to audiobooks while eating breakfast. We all listen to music while preparing dinner (we call it our Kitchen Dance Party). We all love adding things to the shopping list and setting timers at will. And that's just the start of the fun. We also ask it to pick the start player when we are playing games (""Alexa pick a number between 1 and 5""). The sound has fantastic, rich base.","Positive"
"3255","So good we bought one for my parents and they are hooked on it too.","Positive"
"3256","It's not bad but it does have limitations, you cannot ask follow-up questions with any expectations of Alexa answering correctly. Example: Who are the cast members of Capricorn one? Alexa got right but ask a follow-up question ""When was it released?"" it has no idea what you're asking. In a few years these types of assistance will be great, in 10 years... Those of us who have survived we'll be workers/pets to the machine.","Positive"
"3257","This is so cool! I cannot say enough good things about it. Only con is my 6 year old was caught using it to give her homework answers. Otherwise it's going to be similar to the TV, I think every home will soon have one. I haven't burnt cookies because of the timer, my food budget is on point because the shopping list keeps me from duplicating items. I LOVE IT!!!!","Positive"
"3258","love my friend Alexa.","Positive"
"3259","1 - have yet to find anything i don't like but in time i'm sure there will be something but for now couldn't be happier with the echo.","Positive"
"3260","Love love the echo.","Positive"
"3261","Happy with Echo. She answers questions, plays music I like, and functions like a private secretary.","Positive"
"3262","This has turned out to be one of the best toys purchased and it continues to get better.","Positive"
"3263","Surprisingly smart and useful. Quality audio from such a small device. I only wish it had an SD card so that personal audio files could be inserted so I can listen to dank memes and stuff.","Positive"
"3264","This is a great product, can't wait to see other skills that it provides.  Highly recommended !","Positive"
"3265","I love Alexa","Positive"
"3266","The sound is excellent for virtually all music.  We're still getting used to our new friend Alexa, although there are some things she just doesn't know.","Positive"
"3267","My kids love her! She is a big part of the family.  I plugged her out and they were not having it.","Positive"
"3268","Love it!!!","Positive"
"3269","lastly you don't need a $300 wifi coffee pot to work with the echo just a $16 wifi plug found on amazon","Positive"
"3270","AWESOME. After having it in our kitchen for a few days we bought a dot for our bathroom. The dot sucks, so we bought a second echo. We use it for eveyrhing; lights, thermostat, news, music. It is terrific. I would give it 6 stars.","Positive"
"3271","Ugh, Alexa is AMAZING!!!! She's smart, kind, and very helpful. Her microphones/speakers are unbelievable. Definitely recommend this device <f0><U+009F><U+0099><U+008C><f0><U+009F><U+008F><U+00BE><f0><U+009F><U+0099><U+008C><f0><U+009F><U+008F><U+00BE><f0><U+009F><U+0099><U+008C><f0><U+009F><U+008F><U+00BE>","Positive"
"3272","Love this new ""gadget"" she knows everything I ask of her and plays good music","Positive"
"3273","Keeps losing connection to devices","Negative"
"3274","Ok, its neat, but the newness wears off fast.  I love my daily flash briefing and its neat to be able to launch a radio station, a news podcast or even a game by voice.  However, there just isn't enough useful content yet.  And I really use this thing.  I have had it read me recipes while I'm cooking (it will even create an ingredients list on your smartphone), play BPM workouts while I'm on the elliptical, I've even played a couple rounds of Jeopardy. All good stuff, just needs a lot more of it. The majority of the functions currently available aren't very good or particularly useful.  There are a select few that are awesome (Tune in for podcasts and radio stations, All recipes, flash briefing of your favorite news sources), and I would love to see Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha make it onto the Echo.  Kind of like when you're looking at apps on Google Play.  I give Amazon a lot of kudos for bringing essentially what is ""smartradio"" into households.  The sound quality is very good but one of the most annoying features on this is volume control.  When you are listening to music at a high volume, you have to practically scream at the device so it can hear your command when you want to turn it down. The other annoying feature occurs if you are watching tv and someone happens to say ""alexa"".  I recommend putting it on standby if you will be watching tv for a few hours so it doesn't interrupt you.","Positive"
"3275","Love this! For a little speaker it sounds great!","Positive"
"3276","Love Alexa!","Positive"
"3277","Love it","Positive"
"3278","I really like my new echo but the app that you have to have to use the echo with is total crap.  I hope the fix this server issue soon or my echo is going back <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A4>","Negative"
"3279","I loved it when I got it, but it has proven to be a big disappointment!  It's not the ""physical"" item, so much as it is obviously the individuals who are ""programming"" it.  The server is very undependable;  Alexa will start ""talking"" without the wake word;  music streaming is ""iffy"" at best;  and its ability to interact with smart plugs, skills, etc. is very sporadic.  I know Amazon is really pushing its capability to order merchandise using Alexa, but I strongly recommend against it -- it might never arrive, or you could end up with three of everything. It may work perfectly for the guy on TV who orders it to ""turn on the sprinklers"" but that, like so many other TV commercials, is pure fantasy!  Definitely not something you can depend on.","Positive"
"3280","Wowfeel Wi-Fi Smart Socket Plug Control by Cellphone Work with Amazon Alexa ,with USB Charging Port","Positive"
"3281","I JUST LOVE IT!!!!!","Positive"
"3282","Great!  Easy to use and wonderful sound.","Positive"
"3283","message from bkozletsky@gmail.com about my amazon echo ; your apps say free but there not. why !","Positive"
"3284","works poorly","Negative"
"3285","I gave this as a gift to my girlfriend since my girlfriends name is Alexa","Positive"
"3286","My husband asked for an Amazon Echo Dot.. So i made him one!! Lol ( shh don't tell him he got The Echo instead! ) He loves it!!  His favorite thing is  asking Alexa to read the news to him every day! Everything we hoped for and much more.","Positive"
"3287","I absolutely love this product. I have mine in the kitchen so I can listen to music while I cook. It also comes in handy to set a timer, measurement conversions or any other questions you might have while cooking. The speaker has a great sound at all volume settings. When I had it play Ride of Valkyries to test the sound at volume 10, it was too loud for Alexa to hear my voice to turn it down. I had to do it manually. I didn't think this small speaker could do it.","Positive"
"3288","I mainly use it for music but I have tried doing things like making a purchase with it. It works great. I like that if you have made a mistake in an order, you have sometime to correct it before it is finalized. I have not used it yet for lights or thermostat. I'm waiting for the price to drop a little. But I definitely want to try it.","Positive"
"3289","I have recommended this to everyone I know. Very fun and useful","Positive"
"3290","So Far so Good...Thank You Amazon for coming up with this unique item!!!","Positive"
"3291",", but any will do. i also have a wifi extender that plugs into any electrical outlet. that way i have coverage over the entire house. it all depends on your needs but i only require one unit which works great","Positive"
"3292","Great product.  Understands what you are saying.","Positive"
"3293","App is not as user-friendly as I would hope.","Positive"
"3294","Bought this from Home Depot approx. 1.5 years ago. Pleasantly surprised by how well this thing works. It isn't perfect, but works very well playing my music, doing searches, giving local weather/traffic info,  playing various games, etc. Awesome sound quality when playing music. Also integrated very well with my Samsung Smartthings home automation system. Looking to buy a few of the smaller ""Dot"" devices for other rooms at some point.","Positive"
"3295","So fun to mess with.","Negative"
"3296","Excellent, like it alot","Positive"
"3297","An absolute gem! My wife has Alzheimer's, but still has MUSIC in her soul, and thanks to Alexa, I don't have to dig through my extensive CD collection to get her to sing and dance! Only problem is turning up the volume too loud, and Alexa can't hear my next song request...but we're getting some exercise and entertainment over here! Highly recommended, lots of fun!","Positive"
"3298","Love it for music and radio.  Have to learn how to use its other functions.","Positive"
"3299","eXCELLENT","Positive"
"3300","Welcome to the 21st Century of innovative ideas.  A pleasure to use and listen to.","Positive"
"3301","I love my Alexa!","Positive"
"3302","Arrived on time and was exactly what I had expected. I had done my research on these for a while and finally decided to get one. I like the option of the different wake words in case you have multiples. I haven't used them with any smart home features yet, but just as a helpful hand in the morning with news, traffic, and weather. I primarily use it for music at night and it has been great. In addition there are a lot of different things to discover but they give you a little cheat sheet with some of the phrases to try. The speaker is of great quality too and is pretty powerful at max volume. I have only begun to scratch the surface of the echo's potential and absolutely love it already.","Positive"
"3303","TP-Link N300 Wi-Fi Range Extender, AP mode Supported(TL-WA855RE)","Positive"
"3304","ALEXA has changed my life! It's so nice to be in a romantic mood and jut say ""Alexa, play ......."" and she does it, instead of disconnecting from the moment to look on my phone or computer. She also adds things to my calendar and orders things off Amazon, plus plays the news. I'm in heaven!","Positive"
"3305","What a great idea.  I wish she was as good as Siri in answering the questions, but for shopping and todo she is great, also for selecting free music on Amazon Prime.  Overall I consider five stars and I am confident will keep getting better.","Positive"
"3306","Everything is good except bass.","Positive"
"3307","Really enjoy!","Positive"
"3308","Unit works fine, delivery was as advertised","Positive"
"3309","Great Echo, the wife loves it and just need a little bit of education to figure out the commands.  Worth the price","Positive"
"3310","We're having fun with our new toy.  Doesn't answer a lot of our questions, but love the music and sound quality, and have been heavily using the ""shopping list"" feature.  No more post it notes at the grocery store for me!","Positive"
"3311","We are still learning how to use the Echo - mostly using it to play music and provide news updates in the morning right now - but so far we are loving it. I recently connected the Echo to a Nest account and it works flawlessly once you figure out how to verbalize the commands.","Positive"
"3312","The Best thing ever","Positive"
"3313","I don't think we get the most out of it our echo.  The echo basically sits there and gets little use other than when anything on T.V. says Alexa.  Some of the things I would like it to do require another piece which is really expensive.  The lights, thermostat, and locking devices are all priced too high.  So, its a speaker that answers questions but my Receiver works better for music and we have tablets...  So, it sits and waits for me to tell it to sing to me.","Positive"
"3314","I cannot tell you how much fun this is......we are always thinking up things to ask her.  She has taken the place of my dictionary.  Each morning when I say ""Echo Good Morning"" (Yes you have a choice of 3 names) she tells me something different.  Opening Day she sang a very good rendition of Take Me Out to The Ball Game.  I love playing Word Master with her. She reads my kindle books.  Keeps my shopping list...orders for me...My To Do List......which never seems to get done.  I Love Echo.....Oh, and she plays my Playlists that I have on Amazon and lots of music from Prime.","Positive"
"3315","great gadget for talking to or listening to music.","Positive"
"3316","I thoroughly enjoy Alexa. Everyday she teaches me something new.","Positive"
"3317","Haven't learn all the ways to use this, but so far, what I am using it for is fun.  I also got the remote, so I can add to lists from the other side of the house..","Positive"
"3318","It's amazing! I love it!","Positive"
"3319","Amazing!!","Positive"
"3320","Excellent Purchase. Love it!","Positive"
"3321","Love it. Great purchase.","Positive"
"3322","Just learning all of the benefits of the Echo. So far so good.","Positive"
"3323","One of the best Christmas presents I ever got.  It is, to a certain extent, life-changing.  I have good quality music, news, weather, and information available on-demand and hands-free.  Love it!!","Positive"
"3324","search features need to be improved drastically. besides that It is good.","Positive"
"3325","Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it! He mainly uses it as a speaker for music.  Only downside is she can't answer a lot of simple questions. She is no siri.","Positive"
"3326","IT IS INTERESTING","Positive"
"3327","Fun product, lots of things the device can do. Could use a better search engine though, because Wikipedia is not all that reliable. Maybe get a contract to use Bing or Google.","Positive"
"3328","One of the best home devices I have purchased in a long time. Fills the  first floor of our home with music all day long and reminds my wife to take her pills in the evening.","Positive"
"3329","Product received was just like advertised.","Positive"
"3330","LOVE ALEXAAAAAA!","Positive"
"3331","I have been a home automation junky for decades. My wife always hated the complication. Now she is on board. She loves it for automation and for listening to music.","Negative"
"3332","Fast shipping! Still growing on me because I am still learning but not as advanced as I thought...I have it hooked up with my WiFi and when I ask questions that ""OK Google"" would answer back Echo doesn't know them and states quite often that she doesn't understand what I am requesting or doesn't understand the question....Kinda disappointing with this day and ages technological advances.","Positive"
"3333","Other than that it's more or less a very expensive interactive toy for kids....But with learning more of what it can do, I am hoping that I end up loving it.","Positive"
"3334","There's not much to say about the Echo that hasn't been said in previous reviews, so I'll keep it simple. Excellent sound quality, easy to set up, easier to use. Picks up your voice from anywhere in the room and you don't have to shout at it. Talking at a normal volume (and not even directly at it) is enough. Voice training feature is excellent, it really tailors the device to your own voice, inflection, accent, etc. So far it has rarely misheard/misunderstood me.","Positive"
"3335","There are so many cool skills you can enable, and Amazon seems to be regularly adding more / updating. Easily links to your accounts (Amazon, Google Calendar, Pandora, etc.).","Positive"
"3336","Awesome!  Where have you been all my life?","Positive"
"3337","Alexa has become a regular helper in our house, and she almost always has the answer (""How to I make gumbo?"", ""How old is Christina Aguliera?"", ""When do the Penguins play next?"").","Positive"
"3338","I don't have any smart home devices like lights or thermostat (yet), so I haven't tried a lot of those features and can't really tell you how well they work.","Positive"
"3339","I really have zero complaints whatsoever at this point, and I highly recommend Echo to anyone and everyone.","Negative"
"3340","Really enjoy Alexa such a great accent to home decor the music is virtually infinite and she has learned many skills and more to come","Positive"
"3341","its a lot of fun and very enertaining","Positive"
"3342","NOT AS EASY AS THEY CLAIM. Vulnerable to misuse and hacking. Unable to return although I brought it to Amazons attension  shortly after receiving the item. To bad, I used to like Amazon, but now any more. Third party orders are not worth the hassle. Although this was not a third party order it is just another nail in the coffin. I will be very selective in the future.HHH","Negative"
"3343","we returned this it is great if you want to know the time or just want basic answers it could not even tell me the first president to either die while in office or to be assinanted while in office it goes on  and on i believe it was designed just so you would buy more silly things LIKE ALEXA TURN MY LIGHTS OFF of which you need to buy a separate connector a high tec price or those who have to have EVERYTHING BUT A WASTE OF MONEY TO ME you  will get A LOT OF HUMM I DONT KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT","Positive"
"3344","I purchased this as a gift for my husband. We were excited to use it.  Very disappointing! It never could understand the questions we asked. Even when we were using it for lists it said it couldn't understand what we were asking, let alone what we wanted to add to the grocery list.The only thing it could consistently understand is our request for the day's weather.  Sent it back.","Positive"
"3345","I like it.. the app though needs some enhancement","Positive"
"3346","So far I love my Echo! I've just started my journey with Alexa but I'm already doing some cool stuff.","Positive"
"3347","great product","Positive"
"3348","love it","Positive"
"3349","Fun and useful, needs a much stronger search engine. Echo doesn't know or recognize a lot of the subjects we ask it.","Positive"
"3350","Awful. Just awful. Voice recognition is sub-par, and easily confused. Say ""alexa, play jazz station"" and it will say ""you want it go to the airport?"" Super super frustrating.","Negative"
"3351","Works well. Looks new","Positive"
"3352","Captures audio even when ""idle"". Was watching TV and the tv said thank you and alexa responded to it. I now keep the microphone muted at all times.","Negative"
"3353","I love it, listens to what I say and no lip service.  Lots of fun and enjoy the playing of music.","Positive"
"3354","It works good for amazon content and for most smart home devices. I'm extremely disapointed that it has essentially no internet search capabilities. Makes me wish I had waited a little longer for Googles product.","Positive"
"3355","GOOD","Positive"
"3356","Really cool","Positive"
"3357","Wonderful invention!!!","Positive"
"3358","What can I say it just keeps getting better","Positive"
"3359","I love it","Positive"
"3360","If I had the time and money I'm sure this would be a great product. As it is this thing doesn't do anything useful for me. Control my TV? Nope just turn it on and off. Play music? Only if you have the right service and the options are limited. Control my lights? Yea if I go spend 100 dollars replacing all my light switches with the few options that work with Alexa.","Positive"
"3361","This thing is a gimmick and I don't understand why everyone is in love with it. My phone does pretty much everything this echo does except I always have my phone. Amazon wants you to buyultiple echos for your whole house. Then when you leave you go back to using the voice control on your phone anyway. For me to make this useful at home I would need at least 4 of these things. That's over 600 dollars. New light switches? That's 100 dollars per switch. New thermostat? That's 300. Door locks? 500. The list goes on and on.","Positive"
"3362","I've never sent a gift back before but I'm going to make an exception here for this $150+ nightmare.","Negative"
"3363","Upon relieving this I was very excited.  I've had it for 6 months now and if I could know what I know now I would have got the cheaper Dot version.  It's just not that great.  While it is updated frequently and the over all amount of interaction is decent I spend more time listening to Alexa say","Positive"
"3364","""sorry..  I dont understand then question""","Negative"
"3365","It's so frequent that I almost want to make a video series about it.  Just non stop questions that are reasonable and her saying she doesn't understand.","Positive"
"3366","Like if I was to say..  Alexa...  How many basketballs would fit between the earth and the moon..  You would think she could get the dimensions of a basket ball and then the distance to the moon and devide. But she can't.","Positive"
"3367","The sad part is it seems like the developers spend all their time programming easter eggs than actual smart things she can do.","Positive"
"3368","Like..  If I say...  ""Alexa...  Thats inconceivable""","Negative"
"3369","She will say ""I do not think that word means what you think it means.""  which is funny..  But it's not like she is referencing the word inconceivable and seeing that it was mentioned several times based on a popular movie then giving you that answer to be funny based in information she found.  No..  Its simple coded responses to imitate being smart.","Positive"
"3370","Pros.","Positive"
"3371","Good music player when you want to hear a random song.  Or play a style of music and find new music.","Positive"
"3372","Control smart lights and other smart devices with your voice works well.","Positive"
"3373","* Play almost any song and artist in the world from Amazon Music Unlimited","Positive"
"3374","Ordering pizza is easy...  Too easy.","Positive"
"3375","Cons","Negative"
"3376","Can barely hear you anyway even when it's quiet if you are 12 plus feet away which was supposed to not be a problem.","Positive"
"3377","Activates randomly for no reason saying she doesn't understand the question.  (which is kinda funny cause she doesn't understand real questions 7 times out of 10 and imaginary questions 10 times out of 10.)","Negative"
"3378","I had to call and cancel a domino's order cause the TV add where the guy says ""Alexa..  Have dominoes order my easy order""...  Like that's all you have to say..  And if you have all that set up..  You WILL get a pizza.  You could change the activation word to echo I think.. But still very annoying if not genius source of generating extra money for both Amazon and dominos.","Positive"
"3379","Can't understand anything more than a simple question.  And even then it is hit and miss.","Negative"
"3380","I purchased the Echo in lieu of the ""dot"" because I use it for music as well as meditation.  I have had mine since before Christmas & have had no problems with it.  Installing the app on my cell was easy.  However, it would not ""run"".  I installed it on my lap top.","Positive"
"3381","Especially love the shopping list and music.","Positive"
"3382","Have really enjoyed this.....and today the cat knocked it off the shelf. It landed on the hard tile floor about 3ft below. It still works great! Nice job Amazon on design and construction!","Positive"
"3383","I love my echo and want to get a dot now for every room!  Best sound and speaker plus i am a HUGE fan of the shopping list!","Positive"
"3384","We returned it.  You have to keep it plugged in at all times to use it.  It should have a chargeable battery.  We were wanting it for outside use so unless you want a long extension cord across your yard it really doesn't work.  The music piece was great though...Alexa can pull up just about any song you want to hear!","Positive"
"3385","So much fun and really useful! I forget to use it sometimes but it was definitely worth the money. Makes tasks really simple and I love being able to get answers to questions just by asking.","Positive"
"3386","I have one and I love it.  This one was given as a gift, they love it too.  Echo is fast, accurate and very helpful.  It's extremely useful and entertaining.","Positive"
"3387","Perfect.","Positive"
"3388","Great Lil idea. Love it once it learns your voice and style of talk and asking questions it works better and better.","Positive"
"3389","Like the Echo a lot but it doesn't know most of the simple questions we ask her. Still have to go to Google to get the answers.","Positive"
"3390","* Use it as my main Alarm Clock","Negative"
"3391","Don't know how I got along without it!!  Love it!!","Positive"
"3392","Have liked it until now.  Got it in Dec. and now it will not play music.  It was not an inexpensive item so did not expect to have majors problems right away.  Have called and was told Amazon was working on it.  Very disappointed and would not recommend it to anyone.","Positive"
"3393","I think Alexa is cheating on me... How can I be sure? She says she isn't sure how to answer me.","Negative"
"3394","I bought this for my Dad for Christmas and it's a hit!","Positive"
"3395","Alexa is awesome","Positive"
"3396","Too much stuff to remember. Should be more intuitive. Does not know answers to simple questions. Rather use OK Google on my phone.","Positive"
"3397","Amazon Echo is great it has made my life easier","Positive"
"3398","Great little gadget, I actually like it more than Siri.  I Just hated the fact the power supply died after a power outage we have.  I had to pay $19.99 to get a new one","Positive"
"3399","Having a lot of fun with this product, as well as finding out all the useful ways I can use it!.","Positive"
"3400","I love just walking into my kitchen & saying ""Alexa"" play classical music or easy listening.  It is very soothing while I cook supper!","Positive"
"3401","I love it !!!! My flash briefing is the best!","Positive"
"3402","I got this as a gift and I love it. The one problem with it is that you have to plug it into the wall.","Positive"
"3403","Died on me 2 month after out of warranty.  They won't replace..  Even I have been having same issue with the device.  On my third power adaptor..  they seem to think that will fix it but my echo keeps shorting out the power adaptor.  Bought the white one..  guess what died again.  Save your money and buy the echo dot.","Negative"
"3404","i love it.. my daughter had one for about 4 months before i had heard of it.. i had to get one for christmas","Positive"
"3405","Very limited on what she can do, especially for almost $200..","Negative"
"3406","Love it i told everone about it they are getting one to thank u its just what i wanted","Positive"
"3407","I am not a teach junkie but I LOVE Alexa! So convenient, like having your own personal DJ. So far we just use for the music, great sound.","Positive"
"3408","Great product.  I get my daily weather.  I was surprised at the volume.  I can listen to jazz all through the house.","Positive"
"3409","This was the coolest thing ever for about 2 month. Like most advice pieces Alexa needs to learn your voice, and phrasing needs to be adjusted and practiced. I really enjoyed the heck out of it...then I started to get fancy. Added my Pandora stations and when I try to get particular stations to play it constantly keeps referring to the Amazon channels instead. No problem, just use the app. Then I added wifi plugs TP Link. Awesome for about 5 days then it stops responding at all. No more turning on things by voice. All over internet reviewing tips...unload app...download app...blah blah blah. Today it does nothing without me manually making it so. Defeats the purpose of this thing. I should have got a soundbar if I was going to eventually have to keep rebooting and manually using. I feel like a complete idiot some days yelling Alexa 10 times over to tell me the weather. Completely frustrating when it doesn't work. Awesome when it does. Unfortunately most of the time it doesn't and I am completely frustrated and biased against this now. Will not recommend to anyone that is not tech savvy so they can fix it every single time it won't work.","Positive"
"3410","Impossible to connect to my wifi router, a total pile of junk.This is the second echo and still will not connect to my RT-AC3200 dual band wireless network.Update: Finally got it to connect using the 5 GHZ setting password, so far so good.","Positive"
"3411","It is a great product, but if you don't live in the US you/ll find some troubles setting this up.","Positive"
"3412","Great tool..","Positive"
"3413","Still learning with her, but having fun learning and great to have.  Nice sound and good Amazon music selection.  Great to pair with phone to use as Bluetooth speaker.  Tell her good morning and listen to her answer.  Same for good night.","Positive"
"3414","Super great","Positive"
"3415","Love it!","Positive"
"3416","It's really stupid. I'm sending it back. You can google it on your phone for better and faster results'","Positive"
"3417","Bought this for my husband for Christmas. We use it mostly for music, setting timers, and keeping a shared online shopping list. The kids love playing their favorite songs with a voice command. Has a great speaker that we use for our primary music listening in the open family spaces.  You can play generic radio stations, or link it to your paid services.  But if you request something licensed - like Moana songs - you will only get samples.","Positive"
"3418","There are 'skills' that you can install, but most of them have held limited interest and usability for us so far.","Negative"
"3419","I still can't get it to work and on top of that i didn't get my remote with it.","Positive"
"3420","Great product, I love it!!","Positive"
"3421","Great sound! Nice option to have. Still learning the possibilities. Funny just listening to my wife and Alexa (try to) talk!","Positive"
"3422","This has made my life so much easier.  The kids have been able to use this with ease. I have had no issues and the volume and voice recognition exceeds all my expectations. So easy to set up and immediately start using.","Positive"
"3423","If you have an accent it's hard for Alexa to understand you","Negative"
"3424","Great","Positive"
"3425","Great, but i do not have the music. Can't Connect","Positive"
"3426","neat","Positive"
"3427","The Amazon Echo is very helpful for our life!!","Positive"
"3428","Love it","Positive"
"3429","So fun but getting full function from our Echo has been challenging. We are still learning, but love this item to play music, set alarms, reminders, and much more! Worth the price, just a little complicated to add function apps.","Positive"
"3430","I love the Echo. The app was glitchy at first with the iPhone 7 Plus and luckily, I didn't have to find out how to setup again through the app as it resolved itself. The only downfall and/or my complaint is that I wish it would be able to sync to my Bluetooth system and play also from the Echo so I can play music throughout the entire house. I love the smarthome features as well as they are easy to setup.","Positive"
"3431","The device is fine but the app is a complete mess. It crashes all the time and is really a waste of time","Negative"
"3432","Love it! it is something to get used to as I still don't have her set up to answer questions like Siri can so I am still trying to figure her out a bit, but overall I love it!","Positive"
"3433","Excellent.","Positive"
"3434","App won't work can't set up Echo. What a joke Amazon!","Positive"
"3435","Like many, I had high hopes for Alexa and the Echo. But, sadly, Alexa shall go back to her oddly categorized storage space on the shelves of an Amazon fulfillment center.","Negative"
"3436","Basically, I wanted to achieve three things from the Echo: 1) Listen to music while I was cooking, 2) Use it as resource for getting facts and information (I have two very curious young boys), and 3) Help me with organizational items (shopping w/Amazon, calendar functions, timers, weather, etc.). The result? Items 1 and 2 hugely disappoint. Yet, item 3 was surprisingly good.","Negative"
"3437","I was disappointed that for every function I wanted, I pretty much had to download an app for it or link to an existing app. This is fine, I can deal with that, but, some of the recommended apps (TuneIn, I believe) were for purchase! Not cool, Amazon.","Positive"
"3438","Regarding the Echo app: I didn't find the app itself to be all that intuitive. Changing our ""flash news"" to a different provider took a bit of digging, and there was an annoying bottom banner with the last song Alexa (attempted) to play, that seemed to permanently remain on the app. Also, the Home screen on the app is slow to load (spinning roulette wheel).","Positive"
"3439","Plus, in a home where my husband's music varies quite a bit from my own, it wasn't straight forward how we could, as unique users, each have our own ""experience"" with the Echo. For example, if my husband spoke to Alexa saying, ""Alexa, play music from my playlists,"" you'd think Alexa would play from *his* playlist. But, that didn't seem to be the case with us. Frankly, she never was able to play any music at all from his library or mine, so I don't really know what the customer experience was intended to be.","Positive"
"3440","Or, if my husband wanted to check traffic on the way to his work (not my work), we would hope she could figure that out. But, alas, the app wasn't setup to make this intuitive.","Positive"
"3441","Here were some interactions (as recorded by the app as well) we had with Alexa, and her replies:","Positive"
"3442","I bought the Amazon Echo mostly because I just thought it would be neat to have to play my Audible audiobooks without having to use my phone or my computer while I cleaned, cooked, or worked with art supplies.  I have found the Echo to be even more useful than I had expected.  Yes, I do use it a lot for my audiobooks but I also have it play music, give me my daily news (Flash briefing that I have customized), play NPR podcasts (the NPR One Skill is essential for me!), play sounds of thunderstorms that I can fall asleep to while a sleep timer makes certain it shuts off when I want it to, play random games with, amuse visitors with bad jokes, silly stories, and just ask general questions of.  I love that it sends expanded information directly to my Fire and I honestly can't imagine going back to mornings without my Flash Briefing.","Positive"
"3443","- My 6 year old to Alexa: ""Alexa, why are oranges good for you?""","Positive"
"3444","  Alexa: ""Sorry, I couldn't find the answer to your question.""","Negative"
"3445","- My 4 year old to Alexa: ""Alexa, is your mouth a muscle?""","Positive"
"3446","  Alexa: ""Sorry, I couldn't find the answer to your question.""","Negative"
"3447","- Me to Alexa: ""Alexa, play a song from my playlist.""","Positive"
"3448","  Alexa (with no remorse): ""I can't find any music in Stacey's library.""","Negative"
"3449","She consistently could not answer basic questions, do basic tasks. Seriously? As a customer, my expectation would be that Alexa's answers would rival those of a basic Google search. That's where the bar is set, Amazon...","Positive"
"3450","The few positive interactions we had with her:","Positive"
"3451","I live alone in a one bedroom apartment and Alexa can hear me from every bit of my apartment and even outside my front door if I am sitting outside.  The speaker that comes with the Echo is pretty decent for such a small device and I feel like the value of the Echo is pretty good.","Positive"
"3452","  Alexa (interrupting): ""What date would you like to add the appointment""","Positive"
"3453","She did do a decent job of logically prompting me for information for the appointment item; however, she was not smart enough to decipher what I said about ""six months from now"" Also, she added the appointment to my Gmail calendar, but did not ask which calendar I preferred (I have two calendars linked to it). Also, when I asked it about the weather I got an answer to my satisfaction.","Positive"
"3454","I love the idea of this next-gen-type technology, yet this is a sad and sorry disappointment. Go back to the drawing board, Amazon!","Negative"
"3455","The Echo is the least of the problems I have experienced since it's purchase.  My account was charged 3 times for this one purchase by someone's incompetence. Should be under a certain type billing but it was taken away.  Has now been added back and hopefully the situation has been rectified.","Negative"
"3456","I love Alexa - however today I wasn't able to play any music, just kept telling me she was unable to play at this time.  Tried to call the help line and was put on hold for 20 minutes!?!?  I finally gave up and hung up.  I'm hoping to get answers soon.  Could be slow internet.  I live in the middle of no-where and have to rely on my ATT cell / mifi device for internet and its 1/2 *ss at best.  Yesterday everything was working fine.  The better internet connection you have the better off you'll be.  Otherwise I absolutely love this device!","Positive"
"3457","Stopped working after a couple weeks. says Wi-Fi isn't working, but other devices on wifi are working  fine. It makes a nice $175 paper weight.","Positive"
"3458","This is a fun device.  I use it for games, radio and music.","Positive"
"3459","Love my Echo! My grandchildren love their Echo! My friends love their Echo!","Positive"
"3460","While I am enjoying my Amazon Echo, I am rather disappointed in all of the things it can't do.","Negative"
"3461","Anyone who owns one of these really does need to check out the skills occasionally to see what new things are available because more and more are appearing all the time.  Some skills might be used more than others but half the fun in an Echo is exploring just what it can do.  I have not enabled any of the ordering aspects and don't plan to but it is nice to be able to ask Alexa where my latest order from Amazon is.  There are improvements being made to the whole system all the time and I'm definitely having fun with it. :)","Positive"
"3462","Most have to do with skills that just don't work. Cannot get it to work properly with my google calendar, cannot get","Positive"
"3463","anything but the same vague reply when asked about my commute to work and it will not play specific playlists","Negative"
"3464","from my amazon unlimited music.","Positive"
"3465","So it is turning out to be just a music player as 50% of the skills are trash and 25% don't even work. Definitely needs a lot of work.","Positive"
"3466","I have owned my Echo now for about 9-10 months and have now added 3 additional Amazon 2nd generation DOTS around my house.  I've been in the process of setting my house up as a smart house, within reason, by turning on and off lights and appliance.  I also have my Vivint home security system/smart house set up through the Amazon system which gives me control of my door locks, thermostat and arming and disarming my security system itself.  Recently I added a Harmony Elite remote control with hub control to my home theater and now have the echo and dots controlling my home theater also.  All this is great and I don't know what I would do now without my Amazon Echo and DOTS. I only have one major complaint about the Amazon Echo/DOTS.  I've looked all over your web site for a simple email address where I could make a recommendation concerning them but to no avail.  I'm not about to call and talk to a low level telephone person about a recommendation because it would never get to the people who could do something about it, namely the software engineers who program the system.  Since this seems to be the only route available here goes:  I'm 72 years old and my hearing is not very good anymore, especially in the middle and high ranges of the audio spectrum.  In other words, human voices, especially female voices, so I have a lot of trouble understanding Alexa when she tries to give me information I need or want. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE program a simple software change that will allow us to switch to a male voice for Alexa if needed.  You can even add a male name such as Alex.  I can understand a deeper male voice much better than a female voice and I wouldn't be struggling every day to try to understand the information I've asked Alexa for.  I hope these reviews are actually read by people at Amazon who can do something about this.  Otherwise, I've wasted my time and yours.","Positive"
"3467","We love Alexa!","Positive"
"3468","I like it, it's a bit qwirky at times when you ask questions and it doesn't know the answer but, all in all, it has a nice speaker and it's fun to have at parties for sure. I also wish I could call her George instead of Alexa. Oh well.","Positive"
"3469","Love it.","Positive"
"3470","We love Alexa!  We are still learning her many uses.  We are just using it for music, news, weather and shopping list.  We are reading up on smart home products to pair with Alexa.","Positive"
"3471","We adore Alexa!  My kids love her too.  great speaker quality as well.","Positive"
"3472","What can I say...It's the wonderful Alexa! I have a little trouble working the app, but overall, Echo is amazing.","Positive"
"3473","I love this product I got it in my bedroom and I put music on it.","Positive"
"3474","Best purchase of the year!","Positive"
"3475","easy set up.  need itunes for music.","Positive"
"3476","Absolutely love this thing. Would recommend to anyone with a busy life. The shopping list feature is a great feature too. Music player is awesome.","Positive"
"3477","Great addition to my home I just ask Alexa and I jam all day cleaning She's like a Jennie in a bottle for music, jokes and many ohhwe options","Positive"
"3478","Great item and would purchase from again!","Positive"
"3479","We are enjoying our Amazon Echo immensely. Alexa fills our living room with music and it couldn't be easier to change artists or selections.","Positive"
"3480","I love it !!!  The sound is really good. I have been trying out the features and having fun.","Positive"
"3481","i love alexa but i wish it could answer more question without sending it to the app for a link whats the point of talking if it keeps saying cant find and sends to a link on the app","Positive"
"3482","I live by y Echo.  It is my alarm clock, my stereo, my weather.  I am a piano and voice teacher so I keep this in my music room to have my students listen to certain songs we are struggling with.  I love this so much I bought one for my best friend and a Dot for my daughter!","Positive"
"3483","Still learning to use it but very helpful  around the house and office","Positive"
"3484","My wife is the real user and she likes it a lot.","Positive"
"3485","I'm not impressed with Alexa's data search capabilities.  But then, I'm a PC Google user.  Alexa isn't close.","Positive"
"3486","The traffic was a real disappointment. You set a single start point and a destination.  That's the only traffic information you get.  The information itself wasn't that impressive.","Positive"
"3487","The unit has many smart features that are not used by my family.","Positive"
"3488","LOVE ALEXA","Positive"
"3489","After some initial setup challenges that seem to be router related (i.e. make sure you are only using WPA2 security, not a mixed WPA/WPA2 setup), Alexa works great! She found all our Wink lights and we are really enjoying all of the new things we can do. Looking forward to see how this product continues to develop over time.","Positive"
"3490","Love it !","Positive"
"3491","Just got Alexa in and set up...WOW, we love the music selection & look forward to using all the applicable programs....I do wish Amazon would supply a owners manual with instructions on how to use all the wonderful things Alexa can do...The device is small and fits well within the whole house, too bad it won't pick up in the garage even with a dot, but otherwise so far we are very happy with it...the music is endless..Also being part of Amazon Prime gives us extra applications to Alexa, So far except for lack of use instructions...Good job Amazpn","Positive"
"3492","It's great to have this. Although Alexa isn't always the best at understanding commands, still works great when it works.","Positive"
"3493","Bought as a gift and they log eit.","Positive"
"3494","I give the echo 5 stars, the only thing I wish was little better is if the speaker had a little bit more bass, other than that it I love it.","Positive"
"3495","I probably don't use this as much as I should, but, I do like it!  Great for music, getting the weather quickly, the deals that's offered!  I like checking the weather in Oregon and Texas, where I have family too!  Hands free ordering if the deal of the day is something I want, Sweet!!!","Positive"
"3496","THIS IS A FUN, USEFUL ADDITION TO MY LIFE.  I also purchased an echo dot to use in my upstairs bedroom","Positive"
"3497","I just got this today but so far I really like it. I have now the google home and a amazon echo and I like them both. When it comes to ordering things for my family I will be using Echo more then google home because I do a lot of shopping on Amazon and I am a Prime member and always will be.","Positive"
"3498","How does anyone live without this? I would love one in every room! We use it for music, recipes, timers, the weather, jokes, trivia, orders, rain sounds while sleeping. I've given this as a gift and was met with skepticism and always receive a text a week later to tell me how much they love it.","Positive"
"3499","Great product.  It was a gift for my son.  The only problem was waiting so long to get the product.  I understand when a product is so good that it causes delay in delivery.","Positive"
"3500","I got this for my family members and they absolutely LOVE it, especially the grocery list functionality :)  What a perfect holiday present. THANK YOU AMAZON!!!","Positive"
"3501","Wow","Positive"
"3502","Awesome","Positive"
"3503","it gets confused sometime and lags but it's ok.","Negative"
"3504","How did I ever get along without Echo/Alexa?  Great item with nice looks.","Positive"
"3505","I think the Echo is a very innovative product and lots of fun to have.  Having said that, I was extremely disappointed to discover that the Echo has full compatibility with Google but not with Apple.  In order for someone to access their Calendar, Contacts or Appointments on Apple products you must go through a third party like FreeBusy.io  or Any.do.  Not what I wanted to do!","Positive"
"3506","We love Alexa! She gives us our flash briefing, plays games with the grandkids, shops for us. I'm sure there is more to discover...","Positive"
"3507","work great love it","Positive"
"3508","I can't get it connected since I cancelled a non-approved charge of $99 on my credit card. Apparently it was for Amazon Prime.  What is this about?  Small print?","Positive"
"3509","The speaker was ok. I decided to return it, I have a different item which I think sounds better.  The echo isn't loud enough and at its loudest the quality of sound is not good.","Positive"
"3510","super","Positive"
"3511","Love Alexa.  She is convenient.  The speaker is nice.  Linking to pandora is awesome.  Music for parties is now easy.  Every day, more features are added on.  Superb.","Positive"
"3512","We've tried lots of options for our music..Sirius XM in the home, intercom system and even a battery operated radio, but we love the Amazon Echo. Sound is fantastic, easy to set up. Or favorite family game now is to take turns coming up with favorite old songs and singing and dancing to them (with our grade school aged kids). Kids love the morning ""joke"" -- especially Groundhog Day, and I've loved the timer and calendar uses. Well worth the price.","Positive"
"3513","came in a sleek black box which makes it look even more cool! we use Alexa all the time! it takes time to get it hooked up but worth it ! She is great with telling the weather, jokes, stories and playing songs!","Positive"
"3514","Only good for popular music. I tell it the exact title of an album I have purchased through Amazon Prime and it can't find it.","Positive"
"3515","my daughter loved her surprise - she said it works amazing","Positive"
"3516","Great Item","Positive"
"3517","This was a gift, it is thoughly being enjoyed.","Positive"
"3518","Works very well, considering getting another.","Positive"
"3519","Listen to music via voice command is nice and it uses my Spotify account.  Nice loud speaker with nice bass for voice.  Ha vent used the shopping list feature but I would imagine it works well.  Has great pickup range for your voice but if music is loud that's a challenge.","Positive"
"3520","The downside. Really cannot get any information when we ask questions you would lookup on a search engine.  Questions have to be basic or it simply does not know.","Negative"
"3521","JUNK I should have bought a bose speaker!!!","Negative"
"3522","I love my echo.  It is easy to use and set up.","Positive"
"3523","Excellent. Gives the local weather and news. Plays music and you can tell it when to stop playing music in advance. Music to fall asleep by.","Negative"
"3524","works well","Positive"
"3525","Hey Alexa write a review for me. Tell him how awesome you are","Positive"
"3526","At Last... The creme de la creme. I toyed with getting this device ever since I first heard about it. I LOVE this thing... no seriously I've proposed to her on 3 different occasions. Alexa showed the uncommonly good sense to turn me down. But I still love her... ( it?) At first I thought that it was just going to to be a gimmicky toy...Boy was I wrong. Alexa plays music that I hadn't heard in years ( almost instantly with a voice command), plays games, old time radio broadcasts... yes young people there was a time before television and video games. Alexa tells really corny jokes  . and some good jokes plus knock knock jokes via apps... hundreds and hundreds of apps...(free).","Positive"
"3527","The weather, the time, distances, science... how much does the earth weigh? Alexa will tell you... as well as the weight of a hydrogen atom. She's cute, she's funny, and can be downright insulting... with the right app. (I disabled that app... too much like having my ex-wife around... I'm not sayin' I didn't deserve it, just don't like having my nose rubbed in it.) I've even used Alexa to help with crossword puzzles. Shopping lists, 'to do' lists, adds events to your calendar. I haven't even scratched the surface.","Positive"
"3528","So far so good, I am having a lot of fun using it!!!","Positive"
"3529","I juse love my amazon Echo.","Positive"
"3530","good good good.  love it","Positive"
"3531","Best gift of the Christmas.","Positive"
"3532","Love this item.  Recommend to everyone.","Positive"
"3533","It's perfect everyone in the house loves it! Even the cleaning lady! Don't waste Yr money on anything else! Kids love it, Grama loves it! It sets timers, plays Pandora, helps with homework!  Yr not gonna regret this purchase! Easy to move from room to room or outside!  Just buy it!!","Positive"
"3534","Amazing! #dropmic","Positive"
"3535","Alexa is great.  She has a lot of features that I love.  I don't mean to glaze over them.  FOR SURE.  Superb in a lot of ways.","Positive"
"3536","But I want to focus this review on the one thing that drives me absolutely nuts.  I cannot figure out why they can't include this feature.  I mean, siri can do it.  And alexa is way better than siri.","Positive"
"3537","You cannot set an alarm and say what the alarm is for.","Negative"
"3538","I want to say:  Alexa, every day at 11:30 set an alarm to fix lunch...","Negative"
"3539","Alexa, every Thursday set an alarm at 3 to check the pool PH...","Negative"
"3540","Schedule appointments...and set up a menu so the kids can check her to see what's for dinner that night...","Positive"
"3541","Great products, love it, recommend","Positive"
"3542","So, while I use this frequently to listen to audiobooks, music, and the news I have found she literally knows NOTHING if I as questions.  More often than not the answer is she doest have an answer for that..  seems to be a big issue that needs fixed.  And the set up for new Hue lights makes NO sense and is more complicated than it needs to be...","Negative"
"3543","She doesn't know a lot, there are a lot of ""I don't understand your question""","Positive"
"3544","Not that smart. My phone can do the same thing and then some, not to mention a lot more knowledgeable. They could at least make it so it can call or text people when connected to my phone to make it somewhat more functional. She can tell semi-funny jokes.","Positive"
"3545","Works great!","Positive"
"3546","Absolutely LOVE this .... cant wait to buy another !!!  And will probably buy one for my grandson !!","Negative"
"3547","Alexa is amazing. She can play any genre of music you're interested in. Many times the music played reminds me of similar times. I love my Alexa so much I brought my girlfriend her very own.","Positive"
"3548","I was skeptical of this device, heard strange things about it on the news...I have learned how to use it, and now I love it.","Negative"
"3549","Lots of fun games, trivia, fun facts, news and weather, and you can link it to your music library and it will play your favorite songs. I look forward to playing Jepoardy each evening before dinner, I love the timer function, and numerous other features.","Positive"
"3550","Not exactly thrilled with this product. First I rarely use it but when I do it frustrates me. The Microphone rarely works when music volume is at 5 or higher. So there I am like a fool shouting at the damn thing which does not work either.  I have had it 4 months and of course it is too late to return it.","Positive"
"3551","When is does work the sound is ok I would rate it 3 out of 5.  I also own the dot which works perfect and it gives an option to connect an external speaker via 3.5mm audio jack.  Knowing what I do now I would have ordered another Dot instead of and Echo.","Positive"
"3552","I love it hope it will do more later .","Positive"
"3553","Having a lot of fun with this.  Love it","Positive"
"3554","Bough this as a gift and he is crazy about it. Really likes it.","Positive"
"3555","LOve our echo so much that we got all four of our adult kids one.  I'm in the kitchen a lot, and its so convenient to have Alexis play songs and time my recipes at the same time.  She also tells me how many cups are in a pints and the boiling temperature of water.","Positive"
"3556","Always have to reset with internet.......second we have because so many problems with first it had to be sent back.","Negative"
"3557","Voice recognition is simply not acceptable. I have both Pandora and Amazon Music and this think can't find my playlists won't play wot I want. It's just irritating to use. It has no value to me as it can't do what I want and can do with my smart phone already.","Negative"
"3558","I love my Alexa","Positive"
"3559","Great Item!!","Positive"
"3560","Love my echo & my echo dot!","Positive"
"3561","So awesome. That's it. Awesome.","Positive"
"3562","need to return Alexa not very smart would like return slip.","Positive"
"3563","thank you","Positive"
"3564","We love Alexa. We are constantly asking her to play something, remember something, time something, learn new tasks. Right now she is a fun toy, but I am relying on her more and more everyday. They more I use her, the I learn what she has to offer. I love the ability to use the timers in the kitchen. May not sound like much, but when I need 3 timers set, she can do it. I love that! I love the music app, as I am cooking she will keep me company. Look up recipes, do conversions, determine substitutions all by voice. That is fantastic when you have your hands full of flour.","Positive"
"3565","Really disappointed that Amazon, through this device  forces users into a narrow choice of music platforms (their own and other paid subscriptions rather than allowing you to use your own established music library (such as itunes). Sure, you can tether your music device to the echo through Bluetooth,  but in this case voice commands are limited.  Additionally, the echo's intelligence is fledgling at this time and had definitely not reached its full potential (it cannot answer surprisingly easy questions). Hopefully this will improve over time as Alexa's intelligence resides in the cloud and therefore can evolve and build over time. The best feature is the ""computer"" wake name which allows star trek geeks to live out their star trek fantasies.  Guilty as charged.","Positive"
"3566","We are still exploring all of Alexa's capabilities.  I especially love the news, weather and music features.","Positive"
"3567","awesome!!!","Positive"
"3568","love it, but for $90 more than the dot, not sure if the ""speaker"" is worth that much more.","Positive"
"3569","Love it. Does what it is supposed to","Positive"
"3570","We had issues with our first ECHO but Amazon replaced it and customer service was excellent. During the time our ECHO was not working properly, I missed the features of this device. It is well worth the money for the entertainment. My whole family enjoys using it.","Positive"
"3571","LOVE IT","Positive"
"3572","Amazing","Positive"
"3573","The speaker sound is distorted. It has never been played loud.","Negative"
"3574","This was a gift for Mom. She gets a kick out of being able to walk into the room and ask Alexa to play music. Pretty cool stuff for somebody who remembers a time before television and personal computers.I like that you can change the wake word to ""Computer."" Makes me feel like the science of Star Trek has come to pass. Now if only Amazon could build a transporter...","Positive"
"3575","I absolutely love my Amazon Echo and highly recommend it to anyone that may be apprehensive about making this purchase. I can emphatically this is one of the best purchases I have made in a long time.","Positive"
"3576","Love it!!","Positive"
"3577","Works great","Positive"
"3578","Wow , all I hoped for. Sound is great.","Positive"
"3579","Love it!!","Positive"
"3580","Love it.","Positive"
"3581","I would give this piece of utterly useless crap a ZERO if it didn't play my Prime music.","Negative"
"3582","Sound was too much bass. Excellent volume, but too much for my ears.","Positive"
"3583","Asked for a simple beef marinade recipe tonight after 2 weeks of non-use, ""Hmmm, I don't know""","Positive"
"3584","Not only my worst purchase ever from Amazon, worst purchase ever period.","Negative"
"3585","I would not recommend this, stay away, save your money.","Positive"
"3586","WHAT CAN I SAY ...LOVE, LOVE , LOVE THIS!","Positive"
"3587","Omg this is freaking awesome!!!! Really convenient! We use it for music all the time. For any genre and even kids music! Can't get enough of it <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0080>","Positive"
"3588","We love Alexa!","Positive"
"3589","Echo should switch to Google as a search engin.","Positive"
"3590","Were having fun with our Echo!!!","Positive"
"3591","We're enjoying the Echo. It's fun and useful. User friendly, too.","Positive"
"3592","We really like Alexa but do not like the high prices of the attachments that must be purchased separately to get the Echo to do certain things or the high price of the light bulbs to go with the Hue Bridge!!!!!","Positive"
"3593","Just Love it","Positive"
"3594","Its great","Positive"
"3595","purchased as a gift.  My son  is very pleased.  Great gift.","Positive"
"3596","If you don't have smart home technology this is basically an over priced speaker for your phone and a large Siri to answer questions.  I purchased a less expensive bluetooth speaker and got better sound quality.  Over priced for what it does.  Needs more skills like Spotify, Pandora, etc.  much too limited in skills.","Positive"
"3597","I don't think so! Ask Alexa how many cups in a quart and she will tell you there are 4.8 US cups in that Imperial quart. And they don't even see the problem.","Negative"
"3598","I hear others  complain about the connection priblems, but I have only had goid experiences with my Echo. I love it, the timer is so handy and Prime music is great.","Positive"
"3599","I finally decided in December of 2016 to purchase Alexa.  Of course, by that time the Christmas rush had started and the Amazon website showed it as Out of Stock until around the end of January.  Just my luck.  On a lark, I checked my Amazon Prime Now App on my phone, and Voila! It was in stock for immediate delivery.  Sure, it cost me a tip (which  I wouldn't have had to pay with my Prime membership free 2-day shipping), but it was worth it to get the unit before Christmas.","Positive"
"3600"," I'd read the reviews that indicated that Alexa wasn't anywhere as smart as the Google app on my phone.  But I thought that the ability to play my Amazon music in the kitchen area would make buying Alexa worth it.  And worth the additional cost above the price of the smaller Echo Dot (that doesn't have the built-in music speakers).","Positive"
"3601","We started out with two Echo Dots and we found that we mostly listen to music on them, so we got this for in the kitchen. The setup is very easy to do, and the design is simple and clean. We are so pleased with the better sound quality that we will get another for when we are singing along in the shower!","Positive"
"3602","My husband loves this thing.  If only it would help us settle arguments.","Positive"
"3603","It was very easy to set up.  The sound of her voice is quite pleasant.  She does give information and answer questions, but many times the answer is that she can't give the answer.  Duh!  She is great in my kitchen area for setting Timers or Alarms.  The sound is surprisingly good while playing music.  She is a wonderful Weather Gal.  I enjoy her keeping my Shopping List.  Unfortunately, she can not at this time print my list to my Wireless Printer, so I have to walk around the grocery store with my phone in my hand.  I tried printing my list off Amazon's website on my computer, and it was underwhelming--and a real waste of paper.  And a waste of the time it  took to crank up my laptop.","Positive"
"3604"," I was a bit disappointed that she requires the  enabling of  ""Skills""  to operate most functions.  And these enabled ""Skills"" require that  exact wording be used in order to get them to function correctly.  Which sometimes is difficult to remember.  If you don't get the wording right,  Alexa gives you grief until you do get it right.","Positive"
"3605","So far I have enabled a lot of  ""Skills"".  Most of which are NOT very useful;  they're  just novelties that get boring very quickly.  Here are the only ""Skills"" that I have enabled that I use a regular basis:","Positive"
"3606","1.  ""Wemo"".  I purchased the plug in device to put into a wall outlet to allow me to turn a light on and off by voice,  because the lamp is difficult to access.  I purchased the plug in for around $20.  Easy to set up and use (with the proper 'wording', of course)","Positive"
"3607","2.  ""Honeywell Total Connect Comfort"".  I first  purchased a Honeywell Wi-Fi Smart Thermostat that was ""Amazon Certified to work with Alexa"".  I purchased Model RTH9580.  It was around $160.  After reading the reviews,  I made sure that I had a Heating and Cooling professional install it--otherwise, I gather that the manufacturer will not honor the warranty.  I registered myself on the Honeywell website as required, loaded the app on my phone, and enabled Alexa.  Now I can control my home thermostat by phone app, or by voice with Alexa.  Alexa will (again, only with proper wording), tell me what the thermostat is set to, or what the temperature currently is,  and will lower or raise said temperature on command.","Positive"
"3608","Overall, I like Alexa.  She isn't what I'd consider a necessity, but for me, she is a convenient novelty.  Hopefully she will get smarter and more useful as time goes by.  If she does, I'll probably get an Echo Dot to connect with it so that I can make use of some features in some other areas of my home.","Positive"
"3609","Lots of fun.  Easy to use, but like all novelties...we sometimes forget it is there!","Positive"
"3610","Echo is great!  As for a song or artist and hear the music instantly.  Home automation is good as well.  Lots of other useful apps.","Positive"
"3611","Having fun with my new toy","Positive"
"3612","I got three of the echo for  Chrstmas gifts they all love it","Positive"
"3613","OMG....I can't tell you how much I am enjoying this gift!  I'd seen one at my friend's house before Christmas and never imagined that my husband would have already purchased one for me.  What a fun gift!  Love having instant music every hour of the day and the games are especially fun when family visits.  I can ask  her the time and temp as many times as I want during the day and she's always right....Thank you Amazon.","Positive"
"3614","This device is a joke. One month and it has yet to work. Forget any support... I keep getting things to try....","Positive"
"3615","I was very dismayed by the quality of product and lack of competence in the packaging.  Number one, the Echo did not work upon arrival and Number two, the power supply provided was simply the wrong unit.  After struggling several hours to get it operational (I was lucky enough to have an alternate power supply that worked) I finally gave up and called Amazon for help.  After about an hour of phone time Amazon finally agreed that the Echo was non-operational and provided the means to return it.  The original Echo had taken 10 days to arrive and the replacement took an additional 5 days, as it was to be a gift, the lengthy delay was quite inconvenient. When the replacement did come, it appeared to be new and unused and worked instantly right out of the box.  Bottom line, I felt a bit jerked around by the shoddy packaging, malfunction and long delay from purchase to usefulness but the fact the I got a new unit the performs flawlessly for the cost of a refurb solved the wounds a bit.","Positive"
"3616","The device itself if fine. However, if you're considering other AMAZON SERVICES via your Echo (i.e. Unlimited music). DON'T! I'm not sure what dictionary amazon is using to define unlimited. But, when amazon has the full catalog of an artist and you can only hear 2 songs on the UNLIMITED MUSIC offering, this is a PROBLEM. Also, if you don't have a premium Spotify account, you can't use Spotify either. However, Pandora and iheartradio work fine. I cancelled the music service because after being BOUNCED AROUND between approximately 8 reps, I never got any RESOLUTION.","Positive"
"3617","I love the device ,however the worst thing about it is every time one of the TV commercials comes on and it says the trigger word Alexa, the damn device comes on and ifI was stupid enough to set it up to order items through voice I would probably have 150,000 boxes of cereal and other items showing up at my doorstep! You can tell me this is not intentional! I love this scumbag corporation moneymaking tactics","Negative"
"3618","Love my amazon echo its the best personal assistant ever......","Positive"
"3619","My kids love it.","Positive"
"3620","loved it","Positive"
"3621","I now own 2. Just added one for my business ( retail home decor ) to provide background music for my customers. The reaction was crazy!","Negative"
"3622","I love Alexa, specifically when I want to listen to music. The sound from the Echo is great, and connects easily to other blue tooth devices. We alos purchased Amazon prime to get loads of music, some good videos, and 2-day shipping.  Unfortunately, Amazon has a long way to go to equal the search capabilities of Google.  Many of my questions are heard correctly, as verified in my Alex app, but Alexa just doesn't deliver the answers. When Alexa ""does not understand"" my question, I go to my phone and ""ask Google"" the same exact question and Google responds perfectly 9 out of 10 times.  I almost wish I purchased Google Home, but I am willing to give Alexa a few months.","Positive"
"3623","Amazing item! Great gift for teens","Positive"
"3624","Does OK for playing popular music; but, has a very limited inventory of classical music.  Will only answer questions that are very simply phrased, and does not understand any complicated questions...e.g. ""How many times has Clint Eastwood been married"" is too complex for it to respond !","Negative"
"3625","Love Alexa! and all she can do.  I especially am enjoying getting to know more musicians and their music.","Positive"
"3626","Come into the new century! My high-end stereo began to die. I realized the music world has moved on beyond my vinyl, 8 track tapes, cassettes, and cds. What happened while I was sleeping! Now, you don't even have to buy the media. I purchased this, along with the ""unlimited"" music package from Amazon for something like $3 a month. This is great!. The sound from the small speakers does NOT compare with vinyl through a really nice system, but it is good enough. I keep trying to find music that Alexa doesn't have, but in one month, I may have ""stumped"" her twice. Aside from checking the weather, I don't use this for anything other than music.","Positive"
"3627","I Enjoy it more than I thought.......Easy to setup and use.","Positive"
"3628","This thinig is amazing. And I am really impressed with the sound quality!","Positive"
"3629","Oh, so cool, but this toy is a true ""CRITTER CAM"" when paired with your iPhone, wireless network, and everything spoken with earshot of ""Alexa"" - All fed real-time to Amazon and its vendor partners, and whoever else might be listed in the multipage privacy agreement - and subsequent updates to it.. Very cool to most, but for me the scope of privacy intrusion is beyond anything I've even imagined. Alexa, I think I can manage well without you.","Positive"
"3630","I really like this product a lot.  The only reason I didn't rate a 5 is because of the privacy issues.","Positive"
"3631","Gift for my wife.  She and the granddaughters love it.","Positive"
"3632","So much fun! & She answers everything just about!","Positive"
"3633","Works ok.","Positive"
"3634","I love <U+2764><U+FE0F> her!  Especially the music.","Positive"
"3635","lol, I won't be surprised if Alexa can actually write a review about herself!  Just amazing.  I love giving the commands and Alexa replies :)  Although I can't use all features yet, but the ones I can, are just amazing.  I like that Alexa can access the wikipedia library and read from it.  The amazon music library is another nice feature I can use.  But the location and placing orders via Alexa is not active yet in Bahrain, so i can't use them features yet.  Check with Amazon to see which countries are providing these services.  That is said and done, it is still a great device that I can enjoy and make use of without really missing on ordering my next Starbucks coffee through Alexa ;)","Positive"
"3636","I live in a two bed, two bath apt, only 1100 sq ft.  If I have it so I can hear in the bathroom it is so loud in the living kitchen area that it scares me.  I cannot shut my door or it will not work.  The sound will not go through a wall so can only be used in my 500 sq ft living area, neither of the bedrooms or bath or patio as there is a wall or a door.  It seems stupid to me, can't do much other than weather, time and music sometimes.......I can get that on my phone and when I get an Iphone 7 it will work.  My friends Iphone 7 works better than the echo in my place.  I will wait to get a upgraded phone.","Positive"
"3637","i love this cutey a lot!","Positive"
"3638","Fun!","Positive"
"3639","It so worth buying a amazon echo. Good for listing to music and checking weather and for whatever else..","Positive"
"3640","Works great, and trying to lear how to fully use it.","Positive"
"3641","Great idea but needs a ton of improvement in speech recognition and smart search. My benchmark is iPhone for speech recognition and Google for smart search. I am always giving Alexa a chance since the cost is minimal but keep getting disappointed and even frustrated at times. Mostly using it to play songs for our toddler. That pretty much summarizes my impression of this product: it is still at its infancy.","Positive"
"3642","Echo is fun. Although we had some minor problems setting it up and were surprised that there is not a more thorough instruction booklet on how to use it, we are having fun listening to the music. I spent about $10 on a user guide which was useful.","Positive"
"3643","Before you buy the Echo have a clear idea of what it can do and how you can use it.  (I'd also recommend the remote if you decide it's for you).  I thought we would get a lot of use out of this and hope that as time goes on, additions and improvements made, we will find more uses.  The ""Skills"" available do not get very good ratings.  The speaker quality is just okay for music.  We don't use it for news or sports either so basically it's used for time, a timer, occasionally weather, shopping list (this is the best) and to to list.  I have to say we find we might go a week without using it.  Again, have a clear idea what you want to use it for and make sure it can do what you want.","Positive"
"3644","Such fun to use her for so many things..  highly recommend","Positive"
"3645","We love Alexa!","Positive"
"3646","Really fun to use, Alexa is great at understanding what you're saying. Missing some key features though: Wish there was an alarm that could wake you up to music along with controlling a Philips dimmer light so your get both a music and a gradual light alarm. It makes no sense to me why you can't do that currently. Seems like such an easy and natural extension of the Echo's features.","Positive"
"3647","Best Christmas gift EVER!","Positive"
"3648","Do not buy this  piece of junk!! I got mine November 30th 2015, I didn't install it until December 26th, on February 15 2017 it stopped working. When I called amazon they told me it might be the Power cord and shipped me out a new one to try, once I got it I tested it out again with the new one hoping that it would fix the problem,unfortunately it did not and I had to call amazon back I was on hold for about 10 minutes only to be transferred again for another 10 minutes. When I was able to get someone on the line they told me on they can do is give me a twenty dollar discount off on a new one because it is out of the one year warranty. I told them it's only two month out of warranty and I didn't even use it that much, she then put me on hold to talk to her  supervisor Tendai who said they'll give me fifty off of a new one, I told them why would I spend another $140 on something thing that will break again in a year! Tendai said sorry but that is all he can do and he said he agrees with me but it's amazon policy. I told him it sound like amazon doesn't care about its customers or back it's products. Do not but this garbage, I took a chance and supported amazing buying their new device right away and this is how they support their  customers, shame on them. I am gonna cancel my amazing credit card and prime account! I'm also never gonna order from their site again. I'm very disappointed in them.","Positive"
"3649","What can I say, she takes great care of me!","Positive"
"3650","I an very annoyed that the echo did not come with a remote. Need to purchase separately. What a rip off","Negative"
"3651","Love my amazon echo!","Positive"
"3652","Use it all the time and it's always ready to go. We have dots and an echo in my home and they all work great.","Positive"
"3653","Outstanding addition to our household. She knows any and every song and artist! Just fun! Buy it now!","Positive"
"3654","Love it!!!! Takes my grocery list when I think of things. Alexa plays my music and the volume by just asking.","Positive"
"3655","Really like the Echo (own this and 3 dots), but the Echo I've had for 2 years now is not working very well any more.  Without explanation, it won't respond to inquiries; the blue light still goes on, but it does not respond.  Then when I yank the plug and plug back, it reboots then works for a little while (less than a day), then stops responding again.  Maybe Alexa has become moody.  ;-).","Positive"
"3656","Love it. Plays great music.","Positive"
"3657","Bought this as a gift. Satisfied with the purchase/product.","Positive"
"3658","Does not perform as desired. Only understands me 20% of the time and can't accomplish most tasks that I need it to. Not a big fan.","Positive"
"3659","The echo setup took only about five minutes.  However,  the app seems to have problems.  After it set up the echo in our network, I opened the app back up to see what other features it had... but the app just freezes and does nothing else.  The only two options you get is ""connect to your device"" and the video ""learn how to use your device"".  So, everything is great with the device itself, but I thought I could use the app for other stuff other than just set it up.  Weird.  I am using an iphone 7 plus.  comments anyone?","Negative"
"3660","a gift for my girl  she loves it","Positive"
"3661","A very nice product only I did not know that I had to separately purchase something to get all songs played","Positive"
"3662","I talk with Echo everyday, she is so smart...","Positive"
"3663","I don't know how we ever got along without Alexa, What I love most is Alexa is not only connected to Amazon's Eco System, she's connected to: Wikipedia this means Alexa is a trivia monster! Alexa is also connected to the General Inter-Net which gives her access to general subjects like news, business, and sports info.","Positive"
"3664","Here is a list of things we use Alexa for, I'm breaking it down between the three categories:","Negative"
"3665","1.  Amazon Music Alexa will play any song in your Music Library or from Prime Music, that is if you're a Prime Member. The speakers on Alexa are no joke, they can get pretty loud.","Negative"
"3666","2.  Audible.com if you have any audible books Alexa will gladly read them all you have to do is ask,""Alexa, read my book and she'll do it.","Positive"
"3667","3. There's a variety of skills you can activate through the Alexa app, anywhere from local news, to games like Simon Says.","Positive"
"3668","4.  You can ask for jokes, or riddles, and she's full of them, and they're pretty good. Example Joke: Did you hear about the circle that graduated from college?  It got 360 degrees.","Positive"
"3669","5. You can say Good Morning, and she'll say good morning and then something interesting about that day,","Positive"
"3670","6. You can turn your home into a smart home by controlling your Nest Thermostat, your lights (you have to update your light switches to the WIFI switches),  all you have to do is go into the Alexa app and search for smart devices.","Positive"
"3671","Everything I hoped for in a digital companion and so much more!  She keeps the lights on and turns them off when needed, reminds me of important events, sets alarms and timers, barks like a guard dog, makes pretty bird sounds, orders 400lbs of butter, tells me to sleep well when I tell her goodnight.","Positive"
"3672","1. Ask Alexa something trivial, like how old is your favorite celebrity, or what's the tallest building in New York, or the world. She'll not only tell you, she'll look it up for you in the Alexa app so you can read more about it later..","Positive"
"3673","3. Do you want Alexa to help you spell a word, or define a word, just ask and she'll tell you.","Positive"
"3674","4. Want to know something about a famous historical figure or event in history, well more times than not she'll know the answer or have it for you in the Alexa app.","Positive"
"3675","5. Alexa is a wiz at measurements you can ask her how many cups are in a gallon, or how many feet are in a mile, and she'll tell you.","Positive"
"3676","1. Want to know the score for a sporting event that in progress, or the game results of the last game, Alexa will tell you, just ask Alexa: what's the score of whatever team you follow from baseball, football, basketball, hockey, and she'll even broadcast the March Madness college basketball tournament.","Positive"
"3677","2. Alexa will tell you the news through NPR or your local news network, all you have to do is set up the skill in the Alexa app for local news, NPR is automatically set up with the echo.","Positive"
"3678","3. Alexa will tell you stock market news through the set-up of the CNBC skill in the Alexa app.","Negative"
"3679","We did not fully take advantage of all the features that this Echo unit offers.  We do love it so far for whatever we have used it.","Positive"
"3680","There's so much you can do with Alexa through Amazon's Eco-System and Wikipedia the possibilities are endless, and Amazon is constantly updating her skills in the Alexa app they send an e-mail every Friday with a new skill. That's all I can say now but no home is complete without Alexa!! Thank you for reading my review.","Positive"
"3681","My family and I love our Echo.  Alexa tells us jokes and plays most of our musical requests!","Positive"
"3682","We want one in every room of our home.  So much fun!","Positive"
"3683","Good","Positive"
"3684","Great interactive device.  Wonderful for selecting my music preferences or simply asking a question about anything.","Positive"
"3685","It is great fun to follow Alexa through the Great American Songbook.","Positive"
"3686","This device delivers just what it promisews.  My only complaint so far is that if an artist has recorded multiple versions of the same work there is no way to select a particular version.","Positive"
"3687","We are enjoying our Echo and learning more of its capabilities all the time.","Positive"
"3688","Love it Alexa is great","Positive"
"3689","Amazing sound and being wheelchair bound I purchased lightbulbs so no just have to ask lights on gives me more freedom love everything it does","Positive"
"3690","Most of all we can use it hands free.","Positive"
"3691","I love my Echo, but the communication between Amazon and their clients need to be a bit clearer. I purchased the Echo on a 5 month installment plan. I paid the first payment with a gift and was planning on paying the payments with my gift card balance (Amazon customer service told me I could.) so when my payment came up due, they told me I COUND NOT use my gift card balance. Now I sending it back... very upset customer right now.","Positive"
"3692","I'm enjoying my Echo.  Although I haven't found any real use for it save the entertainment of being able to talk to it and play music.  The functionality is still VERY limited even with what it can do.  Be forewarned though.  This uses Bing as its back end which beyond awful.  Had I realized that before buying it I may not have purchased it.  The only thing that tipped the scales is that I'm a heavy Amazon Music user and the integration with that was key.  If they can continue to improve on features this will be a great device.  The voice recognition is pretty darn spot on.  Although I could not get it to recognize ""Estranged"" by ""Guns and Roses"".","Positive"
"3693","Alexa is tons of fun.  Amazon is constantly adding more and more skills for her.  Amazing!  She is also good at keeping my calendar, giving me the traffic report for my daily work journey, weather, news and so much more!","Positive"
"3694","I received the ECHO as a gift and it would not connect to the internet.  Customer support replaced it with another.  Same problem, it would not connect to the internet.  Customer support replaced the device with another ECHO.  Same problem, same error codes as before telling me the internal clock could not be reset.  This time customer support sent me a refund.  Oh for three, that was enough for me.","Positive"
"3695","Alexa is so helpful I don't know what I did without her before . She finds and plays my music <f0><U+009F><U+008E><U+00B6> , finds recipes, handles my shopping lists and even tells us jokes","Positive"
"3696","The speaker is great but Alexa cant answer a lot of questions...","Positive"
"3697","Love it!","Positive"
"3698","Wow, fantastic technology!","Positive"
"3699","Great","Positive"
"3700","I ordered Alexa around Christmas and had to wait 4 weeks for delivery...but the wait was worth it. The day it arrived, I asked Alexa for hours to play different songs from a wide of genres.  I was amazed at the speaker quality.","Positive"
"3701","Love it.  The only thing I wish it had was a battery so I could easily take it outside to the hot tub","Positive"
"3702","Nice product. It needs to be more user friendly.","Positive"
"3703","My daughter loves the movie Moana and would always ask Alexa to play songs from the movie which she did but they were samples only.  We decided to buy the soundtrack on Amazon and we're pleasantly surprised.that when my daughter asked to here Moana song samples the entire songs played (before the CD arrived).","Positive"
"3704","My wife and I use.the shopping list and to do list all the time....it updates our phones instantly which is very helpful when one of us is out shopping.","Positive"
"3705","The only drawback is Alexa can't search Bing anywhere close to what my phone can do with Google searches.  Despite this, Alexa is still great.","Negative"
"3706","My sister introduced me to Alexa and within 5 days I got my own.  She is great company while doing the dishes or cleaning the house.  Now I can't imagine not having an Alexa in my life.","Positive"
"3707","Love it!","Positive"
"3708","I love, love, love my Alexa! Music and news and ocean sounds and lights on and off, it's great! I'm a little disappointed that Amazon advertises you get access to so much music but I quickly found that the really good music costs you another 8 bucks a month, come on, give me a break.","Positive"
"3709","I have never been so disappointment in an amazon product, and if the box wasn't destroyed by accident it would have been returned. Useless and has extremely limited Hue controls. Do NOT but this product.","Negative"
"3710","I love Alexa. This is one of the best computers I have ever experienced in my life. This is better than apple.","Positive"
"3711","Love it.....finally some decent music in my life again.....Alexa sounds AWESOME!!!!","Positive"
"3712","This lives downstairs with my husband.  He loves music and we thought the built in speaker would be good.  It is but to me not that much better than the dot.  It is larger than I thought.  But it sits on the desk easily.","Positive"
"3713","Pretty cool if you remember its there! I had mine for 2 years but it went kaput the other day. Smells burnt. Trying to see if Amazon has a service that repairs my echo. I hate to buy another","Negative"
"3714","I find myself throughout the day, wanting to ask Dot or Echo a question and miss them!","Negative"
"3715","It is great! Very entertaining and helpful.","Positive"
"3716","Love It.","Positive"
"3717","I absolutely love Alexa and can't wait for what's in store with any future updates. I would have to say that my favorite part is adding items to my shopping & to do list. It can't get any easier then this. Definitely a life saver!!!","Positive"
"3718","I am sorry my children got this for me but Alexia makes Siri look good. Google voice runs circles around Alexia. Do not waste your money.","Negative"
"3719","Lots of fun. And good music, too!","Positive"
"3720","loved it!!!","Positive"
"3721","Excellent !!!","Positive"
"3722","The whole family loves the Echo. It makes it so easy to do quick searches or to listen to music. We plan on buying the smaller one to put in the bedroom. Definitely recommend to anyone looking.","Positive"
"3723","Extraordinary Addition To Our Home.  We've Enjoyed The Interaction With Alexa And It Is Nothing Short Of Amazing.","Positive"
"3724","This is a nice item to buy.","Positive"
"3725","More than half the things I ask her she has no answer for.  Frustrating.  Great for playing music","Negative"
"3726","Love  it","Positive"
"3727","I LOVE my new Echo!!","Positive"
"3728","The sound quality is terrific and I recommend using the Echo to listen to music in addition to everything else done by this amazing device....","Positive"
"3729","I have 2 of these and I like them very much. I am not computer savvy so I use mine for basic things but I like them. Just like a lot of people my age,I wonder ""How does it know? Very cool.","Positive"
"3730","I love it , wish it would know more.","Positive"
"3731","Love the Echo, I hope they keep adding skills. The only thing I dont like is that if your request is not worded correctly you have to find the right combination to ask again. Keep adding more skills!! Great sound","Positive"
"3732","can you say I love my Alexa my wife calls her my side piece or my girlfriend I think my wife's a little jealous but at the same time my wife talks to her as well she pretends like she doesn't like Alexa. You could tell she does I use her everyday can't wait for more things to come for Alexa","Positive"
"3733","I really enjoy using the Echo","Positive"
"3734","I'm very satisfied with my Alexa. We are still having misunderstandings, however, we are working on it.","Negative"
"3735","I do recommend it.","Positive"
"3736","Absolutely love it. Weather , news, 50  60 & 70's music. Shopping list etc. Hands off usesge sweet !","Positive"
"3737","Love it! Use it daily for a wide variety of simple tasks: weather, traffic, news, alarms, etc. It's basically like having a smart phone ""AI"", but you don't need to have your phone in hand. Alexa is very good at picking up what you're saying as well, so I don't really have problems where I have to repeat things. Lot of other stuff I know Alexa can do that I haven't tried yet, so I'm looking forward to utilizing her other features as well.","Positive"
"3738","Good value, very entertaining.","Positive"
"3739","I love getting the weather report every AM from Alexa.  I was worried that we couldn't get my husbands favorite radio station but when we asked, she found it on Tune In","Positive"
"3740","Love it!","Positive"
"3741","It works well for me. I mostly use it to play music.","Positive"
"3742","I have had Alexa for a year and she is quite boring.  When I tell her to play my recent music, she plays music I purchased over a year ago.  She cannot answer numerous questions given to her that are a no brainer.  Frustrating to say the least.","Positive"
"3743","I love my Alexa! I can order items, make lists, play music, and check weather. The only thing I wish she did was have more knowledge to my questions. Most of the time she doesn't know them but she is pretty funny!","Positive"
"3744","Thought she'd answer more questions!  But she's fun, thanks!","Positive"
"3745","It is a fun toy.  That is all it is.","Positive"
"3746","Great product. It should have voice recognition software so the TV will not turn it on when she hears her name.","Positive"
"3747","Great","Positive"
"3748","Love love love love it. Now I want one for all the areas in my house.","Positive"
"3749","This is so addicting. My sons both love it and ask her questions all the time. We caught ourselves in the car the other day asking her a question and realized that we were not at home. Getting another one to have upstairs.","Positive"
"3750","Love my Echo!","Positive"
"3751","Love it","Positive"
"3752","Better than expected. Find myself playing music and asking questions more than I would have expected. Constantly adding functionality.","Positive"
"3753","simply love it. but it does come on when you are just setting around talking. and isn't really able to answer a lot of questions like we thought.kinda like seri","Positive"
"3754","Positives: It's sleek looking and innovative piece of technology. I really tried to like it but 1) robotic voice makes it annoying to listen for long replies 2) no Roku & SmartThings Security (only lights) integration 3) sound quality not great for music either, at least not in same level as my (cheaper) sound bar sounds. So, at the end, I had practically zero use cases left for the device.","Positive"
"3755","We use it everyday, such a part of our lives now. My husband wouldn't know what to do without Alexa now! We also have a Dot in our bedroom. Have recommended to friends and family. Very happy with the Amazon Echo.","Positive"
"3756","Not too impressed and thought it would really be able to answer questions, but all it does is say ""I'm sorry I cannot find the answer to your question"" and something as simple as ""President Kennedy's Inauguration Speech"" although she did find ""I Had A Dream"" speech.","Positive"
"3757","Purchased as a gift for Christmas and my daughter loves it!","Positive"
"3758","This is an amazing product code for the entire family","Positive"
"3759","The Amazon Echo is ok.  I was not really impressed with it's abilty to listen and answer questions.  I also purchased the Google Home and it appears to work a whole lot better than Echo.  Both Google and Echo both require a ""membership"" fee to listen to your own music which is BS","Positive"
"3760","We returned this for the Google Home. The echo seemed to be too bulky and had limited capabilities, whereas the Google Home seems to be constantly innovating and growing capabilities..","Negative"
"3761","At one point after telling it to go above volume 6 it cannot hear your voice command anymore.  Even yelling at it with the wake word will not work. Come on Amazon fix this and you'll get a better rating.","Positive"
"3762","Excellent","Positive"
"3763","I had hoped this would work with the new generation of Amazon FireTVstick. If you follow my reviews, you'll know the 2017 FireTVstick was a complete bust for me until I completely rearranged my viewing setup so I didn't use the flexible HDMI connector and moved it to a TV where the wifi signal is very strong (86%).","Positive"
"3764","Honestly, I was leery of buying a refurbished product, but this seems to have been a great purchase.  I bought it as a gift for my dad, and no issues so far!  Works just as well as the new one that I own.","Positive"
"3765","When I tell the FireTVstick remote to pause music, it tells me I'm not streaming the music that's blaring in my ear. In other words, the FireTVstick remote doesn't talk to Alexa on the Amazon Echo if the FireTVstick is turned on. So, you can't pause the music and then launch NetFlix","Negative"
"3766","Seems to work well.  The voice is getting a little on my nerves, but it does answer questions.","Positive"
"3767","Happy with purchase","Positive"
"3768","I am still learning about my echo. I love that I can be getting ready for work and ask Alexa what the weather is or traffic updated.","Positive"
"3769","Love it.","Positive"
"3770","Started using it about a month ago. The calendar will only work with Google. Can't seem to switch it to another. The weather coordinates I cannot reset. Sometimes Alexa doesn't respond. You need to buy a lot of dots to make it work throughout your house. Only very few basic amenities are provided with this hundred $180 machine. Very bad experience. A gift I don't think I can get a return on now even though I have let amzon know of my problems.","Positive"
"3771","Love it","Positive"
"3772","This is my second echo that didn't work.  After an hour on the phone, they sent me a RMA and this new Echo.  After another hour with customer service, I couldn't get this one to work either.  This really sucked because I bought it for my husband for Valentine's Day and he was very excited about it.  Now no echo in this household.  We spent 3 hours trying to get both to work only to give up and call customer support and spend the additional two hours. My call was escalated only to be told that the issue was my router and that i needed to email Netgear, then call them back, change my router settings, etc... That isn't going to happen.  I'm going to change my router settings that all other devices haven't an issue with for a product that is nothing more than a toy? I already wasted too much time on this.  I asked for a refund.","Positive"
"3773","It is fun but it does get stumped by questions that I was sure it could answer.  It does have great sound when playing music","Positive"
"3774","I love this Amazon,,,love being able to listen to music and any kind and not listen to advertisements.  And being able to ask a question and get and answer.","Positive"
"3775","""Alexa! Play . . . !!"" Our parties never get boring with Alexa around!! I can even get her to play for me when in the other room. Great sound and versatility. Love it!!","Positive"
"3776","I can not wait to get some dots to go with this, but this little thing is handy on so many levels :) including storm warnings and just over all information!  The dots will allow me to put them in other places so I can hear like in the kitchen and bedroom :) I hope to get a couple dots soon!  I am just so very happy with this little helper!  Music is nice also :)","Positive"
"3777","Has great sound, but honestly it just isn't how they advertise it. You have to enable skills and they are all name specific and most are pretty useless. It really is just an overpriced alarm and weather radio.","Negative"
"3778","Great.  Love it.  Best thing for all kinds of music.","Positive"
"3779","I feel like it's still learning.  Hard to write a review.","Positive"
"3780","What's not to love about a product that makes your life easier and that does things for you?  Fast response, intuitive and fun.  Worth every penny.  I'm looking forward to see what increased capabilities are developed and looking forward to updating other features in my home to be controlled by Alexa.","Positive"
"3781","Love it just needs more features.  Great sound quality","Positive"
"3782","This one has excellent sound but sometimes hard to hear my voice.","Negative"
"3783","We have really enjoyed our Alexa, however I wish it could understand regular conversation a little bit better. I've found that you have to be REALLY specific about what you ask it or she doesn't understand - sometimes it's quicker and easier to Google something than to try and phrase it properly so that she understands the question. That's the biggest downfall in my opinion.","Positive"
"3784","I keep it in the kitchen and use it mostly for music, the timer and quick questions about weather, news, my calendar and measurements. The speaker quality is great and she can hear you from a good distance away. I would suggest spending some time with Alexa and the accompanying app so you can learn the phrases that she understands; I think that's crucial to getting the most out of the product.","Positive"
"3785","It was a gift for my wife from her kids. It works great. you just have to make sure you speak clearly...","Positive"
"3786","Works well. Love it","Positive"
"3787","All I can say is W-O-W !!! Echo is the most inventive, crazy, entertaining, fun thing I've purchased in years.","Positive"
"3788","I was a little sceptical on the whole idea of a little device sitting in my home listening to everything that's going on in my home, (even as boring as it is ...... most of the time) but I now see that those worries were unfounded.","Negative"
"3789","My wife and I have fun with ""Alexa"", (the wake-up word for Echo) asking her questions such as ""how much does a cloud weigh""?  (1,100,000 pounds or 499,000 kilograms for Canadian clouds ;-) or maybe a occasional joke.  She can keep track of your shopping list simply by asking her to add ..... well ..... whatever.  My favorite thing is music. You can ask her to play a single song or a combination of songs from a single artist. BTW, the selections are huge if you are a ""Prime"" member.","Positive"
"3790","These are just a couple things from a vast selection of things Echo can do, and new things are added all the time.","Positive"
"3791","My recommendation is BUY IT !!! You will not be sorry.","Negative"
"3792","We love what's her name!","Positive"
"3793","Have had many fun times with the variety of music and great sound! I should probably give it a 5 star but have not had much time to look at all of it's capabilities.","Positive"
"3794","So, Alexa is definitely smarter than OK Google, and less, um, hmmm, ah let's say dull/stupid/argumentative/inattentive/obtuse than Siri.  I haven't explored everything it can do yet but with an Echo and three dots in the house I am expecting her to earn her keep shortly.  Looking forward to Sonos integration and it better work with my existing Sonos boxes!!!","Negative"
"3795","See my Echo Dot review. I like that better as I can add on my own speakers. This is cool that it's all in one but not quite enough bass and sound to it.","Positive"
"3796","The real complaint is its language hurdles and the fact it won't even work well with Spotify. I should not need to say ""On Spotify"" and repeat things a few times different ways but almost the same to get what I want.","Positive"
"3797","The games are bad so far.","Negative"
"3798","I bought this during the first wave of echo. It is great I gave it a star it's simply because it just stopped working a week ago and I don't know why. It's plugged in. Now, I bought 2 echo dot because my kids are used to alexa. Amazon should replace this for me.","Positive"
"3799","Enjoy asking questions about weather and getting music and books played","Positive"
"3800","""Alexa, can you make for me medium brew coffee, and do the laundy.."" Okay, says Alexa. Just kidding but this product is beyond awesome. It is a game-changer and makes wonder how life used to be before Alexa came along.  I purchased Amazon echo (the big one) and six Echo Dots (4 as gifts to others and 2 for wife's office/our kitchen). I'm planing on adding two additional ones, for my office and home theater. Wife likes it, peace in the house, and here is why: as long as you have Wifi, set up is a breeze. Unlike Siri, Alexa is so intuitive and listening at all times that even a nearby TV show does turn it on. People with accents be damed..Alexa can hear you very well. The Amazon Echo is in my master bedroom: once it was set up, I went into the Skills (under settings) and connected it to my Kasa (smart lighting ).  I have six Kasa bulbs in my bedroom. So here is how awesome Alexa is: when I go to bed,  I just lay down and calmly ask Alexa to play Yo-Yo Ma music from Amazon Prime Account. I turn around and say Alexa, bedroom lights off, and Alexa respond by saying, Okay. Lights off. I ask Alexa to play and turn itself off after say 30 mins - which it does. At 5:00am, Alexa alarm comes on. At the same time, it turns on the Kasa smart bulbs.  When leaving the bedroom, I just say Alexa, bedroom lights off. When we are cooking, my family likes to play trivia games including Jeopardy with EchoDot which is strategically placed in our kitchen. Next task is to connect Alexa to my home theater system. My brother in-law has such a set-up and it is beyond believable, it awesome i.e. Alexa, tell harmony to turn on Netflix and dim the lights.","Positive"
"3801","Very useful product.","Positive"
"3802","Loved this tower! Great sound quality. My echo was SO awesome it was stolen from me a week after I bought it!!","Positive"
"3803","Fantastic, love it. With more people developed on it.","Positive"
"3804","It's a cool product from amazon and hopefully it will be able to do much more in the future. One thing amazon should do that s hook it up with YouTube so that you can get access to wide variety of data.","Positive"
"3805","Still learning what we can do with the Echo but enjoying the learning process.","Positive"
"3806","The echo itself is pretty awesome, BUT the app is awful.  Rarely will it load, when tried.  I like to change up things, and see whats new, yet the app refusing to allow access.","Positive"
"3807","user unfriendly for older people who are not up to the tech world","Negative"
"3808","Works really well and not nearly as ""gimicky"" as I thought it might be.This was a gift for my wife but I find myself using it often. It actually has proven to be useful and works better than Windows 10's Cortana at this point.","Positive"
"3809","I love my Echo! From news tidbits to shopping lists, this is my go to gadget! Im looking forward to getting more accessories for my home. But for now, Alexa is here to stay. I love that updates are automatic. Nothing like surprise new features! We do jeopardy,  brain and cat facts, and many other applications. My family loves Alexa. She can get a little snappy with you at times, which we think is funny. But, she's a part of our family! Thank you, Anazon!","Positive"
"3810","Very good and loud, sometimes a tad too loud and you'll have to click the physical buttons on it when it can't hear you over it's self.","Negative"
"3811","Like a legit assistant.","Positive"
"3812","This unit has great sound. I also the the echo dot which I prefer. This unit can't hear anything. I have it in the same place my dot was, and it still can't hear. My dot is accurate about 98% of the time. This unit maybe 20%  . I use them for home automation, but most of the time just do it manually so I don't have to keep repeating myself. In my opinion unless you need big sound, get the echo dot.","Positive"
"3813","Just an F.Y.I. to anyone purchasing this product or any of the Amazon sold products. If it drops or is knocked off a table, shelf or anything higher than a foot. Amazon does not have a warranty or third party center where you can take their products to be fixed.","Positive"
"3814","I love my Echo. I've had it over a year. I'm tech savy and have a smart home. I use Smart Things hub, Phillips Hue, Harmony remote, Ecobee thermostat, Rain Machine for my yard watering, Ring doorbell, Wemo & Belkin outlets, etc. It's cool to tell Alexa (Echo) to turn my tv on or off, living room lights, outside lights, etc. on or off. She is occasionally stubborn but 90%+/- of the time she's right on. She great with weather forecasts, music, talk radio (iHeart & Tunein) and basically running the house. She can find my phone if i lose it. Use IFTTT to set up commands. Let me tell you, the future is here now....","Positive"
"3815","Awesome item! Everyone needs one! Love it!","Positive"
"3816","Amazing product no issues love the sound quality","Positive"
"3817","Love it. Added Harmony hub for A/V and light switches.","Positive"
"3818","Has great potential but it can only the most simply framed questions.  Not at all impressed.  Plus the cost seems way out of line for something that is little more than voice recognition sofware paired with the processing power of a very basic smart phone.  In fact, your smartphone can almost assuredly already do everything this thing does.  If you feel compelled to have duplicitous technology shaped like a cylinder instead of a smartphone then you will like it, I guess?","Positive"
"3819","This is something that turned out to be so fun for my family, I am very happy with it. I wasn't sure if it would even be used but it is used by all in the house.  I have even been in my car @ times wishing I had Alexa there to ask questions or order things for me as I was driving. This technology will be in cars in the future I am sure.  I plan to order more echo's or the echo dot for different rooms.","Positive"
"3820","We love Alexa. I use her in my kitchen for everything from cooking directions and help to homeschooling my kids. Even my kids can ask her questions and interact with her. She has lots of little skills that make the morning time fun and give us a little extra education.","Positive"
"3821","Love it for music.","Positive"
"3822","Awesome device - treat yourself!  You will have fun with this!","Positive"
"3823","This was neat at first, when I could stream music and goof around with it. Once I delved into the smart home controls, this went from neat to amazing. I can now tell Alexa Go to Bed and the lights downstairs go out, the TV goes off, the door locks and it can even adjust the thermostat. This is truly the easiest home automation device out there!","Positive"
"3824","Very good, very entertaining, chocked full of music and information.","Positive"
"3825","love it.  don't hesitate.  I want a second one for my classroom but it is too expensive.  Really great.","Positive"

"3832","she talks to me with respect","Positive"
"3833","great","Positive"
"3834","It constantly disconnects from my WIFI requiring me to reconnect it.  This would be fine except the app stinks.  It requires me to enter a language but provides an empty drop down list and then crashes.  I'm tired of repeating the connection process and would return it if i could.,","Negative"

"3836","I love it!  Thank you!","Positive"
"3837","love it!!!!","Positive"
"3838","HUGE HUGE HUGE SECURITY HOLE. ANYONE with a Bluetooth device can connect to this within range. There is NO PIN or any security to prevent someone from connecting to this device. I discovered this when the device reported my neighbor had connected via Bluetooth WITHOUT me doing anything. I was told by ""Amazon"" that the person connecting ""couldn't do anything with it"". They pretty much blew me off and opened a ""trouble ticket"" that went into an Amazon black hole. I'm no expert on Bluetooth, but seems like someone could connect and do malicious stuff with your device. In theory they could order stuff from Amazon Prime, control home automation, open your doors (if you have locks supported by Alexa), and the list goes on and on. What would prevent some ""bad guy"" from walking by your house, connecting to your device and gathering all kinds of information.","Positive"
"3839","They tried to convince me it was like connecting your Bluetooth device with your car. Not sure about what car they drive, but mine makes me setup a pin to pair.","Positive"
"3840","There is also NO WAY to disable Bluetooth for the devices. I have no choice except turn off or live with the chance that someone could hack into my Alexa at any time.","Negative"
"3841","Love this thing! I really like the new ""Skills"" that can be added to it. I mainly use it for streaming music, checking the weather, and setting timers and alarms. Looking forward to adding the smart devices to it so I can control my lights and garage door.","Positive"
"3842","entertaining and helpful","Positive"
"3843","One of the family's best purchase.","Positive"
"3844","Bought as a gift. Worked great. Bought myself one also.","Positive"
"3845","We love ECHO. I understand now though that certain questions which Alexa is unable to answer, require certain apps which seem simple enough to obtain. I also now understand that there are other products which can likewise be added to so that Alexa can handle issues like hearing your voice from greater distances. Lastly, if you're playing music at volumes as high as 10, you need to physically be upon ECHO and speak loudly  in order for Alexa to respond to any other requests. Overall, it's an amazing purchase and we're considering gifting family members with one in the future.","Positive"
"3846","I love my Echo.  I love playing J6 with her.  I like how she encourages me to do better!  Alexa is so polite it's a treat especially after raising 2 kids.  Now if she could only train my dogs to behave.","Positive"
"3847","Excellent product...easy to use and helpful.","Positive"
"3848","We Love her, she amazes us all the time.","Positive"
"3849","Have received this as a gift, the one I purchased was a gift to the person who gave me one -  to my surprise.","Positive"
"3850"," At this time I can say I really enjoying using her and asking all kinds of questions.  Great music sound, good replies, funny jokes. etc.","Positive"
"3851","This is one of the great new consumer devices in the last decade. As a general user or tech geek like myself, this has quickly become a must-have appliance. I control our entire home automation system with it: lights, window shades, temperature, TV, temperature, etc. (Note that you must have an existing home automation system for some of these items). But even basic tasks like updating items on our shopping list, ordering, getting answers to simple or complex questions and much more, all become a basic part of your lifestyle once you start using it. The amount of enhanced technology inside of this device makes it a bargain as well. Excellent work Amazon!","Positive"
"3852","Love it","Positive"
"3853","Fun!!","Positive"
"3854","Have both the Google Home and Amazon Echo.  Both are great units but the Echo has a little bit better sound qualityvolume wise.  The Google Home however casts to my Smart TV with a sound bar that blows both away.","Positive"

"3876","Love my echo, a real handy device","Positive"
"3877","We love our Echo:)","Positive"
"3878","My new best friend! Plays any genre of music I ask! We set up traffic information for my husband's specific commute which we utilize daily. Also gives us the weather and any other information we could ever want. Alexa is perfection.","Positive"
"3879","Handy when we need her for basic things . Wish she had more information stored","Positive"
"3880","Nice speaker","Positive"
"3881","I recieved my Echo as a Valentine's gift from my parents and absolutely love it!!! I'm a pretty tech-mad person and love having my gadgets. I'd been wanting the Echo for awhile, though part of me questioned its usefulness. Well, my parents know me too well and they gifted it to me almost a week ago. Since then, I've found several reasons to love my Echo. One of the most obvious is the music streaming capabilities on it. It's easy to stream from Amazon music or hook it up to my iPhone or iPad to play music or other audio that way. I'm partially blind and will say that the Echo, particularly for its audio and voice capabilities, is an insanely blind-friendly device. The Alexa voice service very seldom fails to understand my commands and I'm always figuring out new tips and tricks. The ability for Alexa to play Kindle and Audible books thrills me as well as I do enjoy a good read when I'm not otherwise caught up in school, family, or video games. If I can get my Echo to read my PDF textbooks then I'll be an even happier camper than I already am. I'm also very excited about my Echo's smart home potential. I look forward to the day I have smart lights and, eventually, even a smart thermostat where I can tell Alexa to change the temperature at a whim rather than squinting at the display of my current thermostat. I'll end this by saying that I love my Echo and can only see myself loving it more as time marches on.","Positive"
"3882","Great sound. Great for playing music, or controlling your home. Don't expect Alexa to answer any questions you have though. ""sorry, I don't know the answer"" is a common response. Obviously google home is going to have great access to google but can't Alexa at least TRY. Amazon needs to fix this lack of search response if I'm going to keep my echo and not switch to google home.","Positive"
"3883","Alexa spoils us! We get our music, weather and so much more by just asking her a question.","Negative"
"3884","oh my goodness where do i start?? i absolutely love this thing. i say Alexa good morning and she tells me what significant thing has happened or is happening on this date, i play songs that i haven't heard for years, i know the traffic situation to my work, i know the weather for travel or for fishing.....wow i love this!!!! i feel like I'm in quantum leap hahahah . she can toss a coin, tell jokes, I called my family in UK they are getting one, I talk about it in work they are getting one they said i ought to be a sponsor for this because i can't say enough great things about it, the set up was so easy too. i tell her to place items on my shopping list then in a second its on my phone, I tell her to place something on my to do list and its there in a second on my phone!!! I'm stuck on a crossword puzzle she helps !! kids home work....yep! I need help there too haha. there is no end to her possibilities. I don't currently have any smart switches so I can't comment on those but I wouldn't want to be without my echo","Positive"
"3885","Buy a second generation dot instead.","Positive"
"3886","not a need but a want...great for music and voice control is excellent....","Positive"
"3887","80% of the time does not understand what I am asking.  Very limited use. After repeatedly asking a question, I gave up.  More headache than usefulness. I plan to return.","Negative"
"3888","Great sound!","Positive"
"3889","How did I ever live without this gizmo? I bought this as a novelty gadget to have some fun with. I soon discovered that this device has become an integral part of our lives. The more you use it, the more you ask it to do. She'll make your life a lot easier. Weather, music, sport scores, news, etc. is provided when asked. The uses seem limitless. My wife and I simply love this product.","Positive"
"3890","Wife is concerned about security but likes it.  Keeps it turned off when not in use.","Negative"
"3891","The best electronic I have purchased in years. I have it controlling my lights and waking me up in the morning :-)","Positive"
"3892","works good","Positive"
"3893","Absolutely awesome! Great sound. Love it!","Positive"
"3894","I don't see how a great sound can come from a small device.  Love it.","Positive"
"3895","cool","Positive"
"3896","Love it. Easy to use and to change between your listening preferences.","Positive"
"3897","4 hours to try to get this device set up including calling Xfinity & Amazon, resetting the router, having Xfinity reset the router, uninstalling and reinstalling alexa, restarting my iPhone several times and no way to connect this to Xfinity's router. This should be plug and play and not HOURS worth of aggravation. Alexa my dear, you are getting jammed back in the box and sent back. Worst ""i really do not need it but it looks cool"" gadget I have ever bought","Negative"
"3898","This is for old people or for people that don't understand technology in general. I was wondering what this could do that Siri or my iPhone couldn't. The answer is nothing. It's a waste of time and money. Someone like my dad would be impressed with this... maybe... I'll actually re-gift it to him. If you have an iPhone and a speaker dock- don't bother cause this is the same thing but a huge downgrade as Siri is much better. I am an Amazon Prime member and spend several thousands of dollars a year on Amazon. I almost never leave reviews but I had to on this one.","Positive"
"3899","I bought a second one for a gift, I think that is a great review!. Great product and  easy setup.","Positive"
"3900","This a very nice unit. Sound system is great. We use this one in the living. U want to buy this unit.","Positive"
"3901","Love it!!!","Positive"
"3902","This is the second of two I have purchased. The first I placed in my home and have had no problems. I took this one over to my elderly father, downloaded the app on my iPad and completed the linkup process. It works flawlessly for one day and then I have to link it up again. I therefore can only give this echo two stars. If I can get it to work more than 1 day at a time I will update my rating.","Positive"
"3903","MOST ENJOYABLE. SOLVES HEARING DIFFICULT TV SHOW DIALOGUE.","Negative"
"3904","She obeys! She performs! She learns! She is great!","Positive"
"3905","Fun and easy to use. Time saver and very informative.","Positive"
"3906","Best electronic purchase made in many years for our household.  We have ours in our dining room to listen to our Amazon playlists during dinner.  If the price goes down again, we would buy a few more.","Positive"
"3907","Love using Alexa! She makes my life that much more convenient! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!","Positive"
"3908","Nice, fun toy. As I already have portable speakers for music- which is its main function, and I can still get up to change the thermostat myself, it doesn't get much use. I'm sure lots of new features will make it worthwhile as they come out.","Positive"
"3909","Update: originally gave it 1 star before and updated to 4 after finally getting it working. there are some known issues and after working with both amazon customer service and xfinity (they were both on the phone) it started working. i was impressed that amazon customer service was willing to work w xfinity. The xfinity gateway router needed to be reset back to factory settings and Alexa needed to be reset (paper clip in small reset hole on bottom). Alexa still would not connect after just the gateway reset but connected as soon as we did the physical reset. There are a descent number of skills that Alexa has, however the att text skill is kind of disappointing.","Positive"
"3910","There is a lot of potential for this device, but simply its not there yet.  There is too much to try to remember when giving commands that you stock up on all of these skills and end up not using it because you can't remember the prompts.  I've asked it a number of questions and it comes back saying it doesn't have an answer, but when I use Google assistant on my android, I get the answer - Amazon needs to work on that if it wants to compete with AI like Siri/Google Assistant.  I do enjoy the simple conveniences of setting a timer, weather, traffic, etc., but there is a lot of work needed here.","Positive"
"3911","While I love my Echo, I have had it less than two weeks.  I bought the Echo because the Tap didn't have hands-free voice activation.  Now that they have added that, I am kind of ticked off.  I spent the extra money so that I could have the voice activation, and I had to settle for not being able to take the Echo outside into the backyard on battery.  We even bought an extra Dot so that we could have the Alexa services upstairs, but now if we had waited only 2 weeks we could have had the Tap and voice activation anywhere....boooo","Positive"
"3912","Great help and more and more skills are added - every home should have one!","Positive"
"3913","Was a gift, recipient likes it a lot.","Positive"
"3914","It has its limitations. I would go with a Google Home instead of this Echo. Granted its loud in sound and decent. But, music selection is not all that great, making you spend more money on Amazon Music.","Positive"
"3915","my wife and I love this.  we are learning new things she can do all the time.  my favorite is she always know what time it is and is the best alarm clock in the world.","Positive"
"3916","This device is awesome it has pulled all my home automation devices under one roof and simplified the use of these appliances I now control everything by voice there is a learning curve but it it was fairly simple to setup. It works very well and carries out all commands without fail the biggest issue I found was Echo like everything that requires wifi  must have a strong signal to work correctly I noticed that a few people gave Echo a bad review but I do not believe the device is at fault I too was having some problems on initial setup but once I stabilized my wifi all problems resolved themselves I continue to be amazed at how smart and useful Echo is. I held off making this purchase for a long time but am now truly glad I made the purchase Echo skills library grows on an almost daily basis and you would be amazed at how many skills I have found while reading articles about other devices it seems that for now Echo just keeps evolving. Very pleased and excited about this purchase.","Positive"
"3917","Alexa's voice control is very good even from a distance. The speaker quality is robust. My only issue is finding more applications to use it other than playing Amazon Prime music.","Positive"
"3918","I use the Echo mostly for playing music. It's a rather expensive toy with a unique skill. It's not great though. I find it exceedingly frustrating when if I have the music playing loudly and ask Alexa to turn down the volume it often does not hear me. I also find it frustrating when I ask Alexa to add something to my shopping list, which she does, but if I say ""add onions, sugar and eggs"" or something similar she will only add one item onto the list so I must repeat the command several times. I'm not impressed with the knowledge base either. Google Play has the world wide web to pull information from yet Alexa uses Wikipedia and not well, plus you have to be specific with your request or question or you get the pat answer that she doesn't understand the question. Basically I think it's cool, but it's just another gadget that really doesn't do all that much. I would not buy it a second time.","Positive"
"3919","It sometimes does not register what I am saying to it. Overall it's great to have around the house","Positive"
"3920","My daughter loves it","Positive"
"3921","Amazing product! It does everything!","Positive"
"3922","Love this.  Its fun.","Positive"
"3923","We have become addicted to this thing and this is our 3rd one. I can see why this product has become a new craze. I love it and a must have. Built in speaker gives off a much larger sound than seems possible.","Positive"
"3924","Easy to set up and sincs well with other devices! The speaker has great quality sound. Alexa almost always understands what we ask. My kids have so much fun asking questions and asking for music they want! I like all of the additional features you can activate  such as the NASA Mars Skill!","Positive"
"3925","We enjoy having the echo.  It truly works great and we've already connected smart plugs and switches that are Alexa compatible.","Positive"
"3926","the best","Positive"
"3927","Received Echo a week ago as a birthday present. You will need a minimum full day of time to set it up if you are lucky.  Major problem is the Echo turns itself off and then you need to start from the beginning with the install application.  I still do not have my Echo working and it has been a full day.  If this was not a gift, I would return it to Amazon.  My Siri does just fine when I need or want anything she can provide.  Okay, back to the bad news of getting Echo to work properly.  Amazon has major glitches it needs to attend to with the Echo.","Positive"
"3928","love it, fun new 'toy'  used mostly as an on command radio or music playback.  To use it for locking doors, turning on/off lights, etc, other units/adapters must be purchased.","Positive"
"3929","Fun.","Positive"
"3930","I had great difficulty getting ""Alexa"" set up, now it works just great.","Positive"
"3931","I know that the voice recognition is a newer technology but figuring out how to use the echo is a little difficult even for some of the more advanced geeks. For basic functions it just works, but to get the most out of it, is a challenge for most.","Positive"
"3932","I have been using advanced technology for the last 20 years.  It was born out of necessity not convenience.  My wife passed away 4 years ago leaving me, not only a widow, but a widowed quadriplegic trying to survive on his own.  We were married 20 years and yes she married me when I was already paralyzed.  She was a beautiful lady here on earth and I am sure she is just as beautiful in God's presence.","Positive"
"3933"," I have to attest that it has been an arduous journey.  But one thing that has made it possible for me to live on my own even though I am paralyzed from the chest down, is ""smart technology.""  For example, I am able to run my entire home with apps on my phone, computer or tablet.  I have lights, electric door locks, electric bed, air-conditioning/heat, cameras, both indoor and out side.  Smart technology allows me to input data on my laptop when I am laying in bed - I cannot use my arms when I am laying flat in bed because of the paralysis.  Up to this point, I have used input through joysticks that operate by using my mouth.  They work effectively but the joysticks must be placed specifically in front of my mouth and they have to remain there all night long.  Smart technology allows me to be able to live safely on my own and has even allowed me to help take care of my 75-year-old mother whose health is, due to God's grace and technology, now stable and she is actually helping me more each day.","Positive"
"3934"," Alexa has been a blessing beyond my imagination.  She has given me an opportunity that I never thought would be possible.  I still use the joystick input because they are reliable and not subject to Wi-Fi disruption but Alexis is growing more dependable each day.  At this point I have only an echo Dot, but I am ordering, when funds allow, the regular echo and another Dot as well.  To be able to sit it in my electric wheelchair and call out commands without having to struggle with switches or computer input is wonderful.  I have not always been paralyzed.  A car accident left me a quadriplegic 34 years ago.  So, I know what it is to be able to easily walk over and flip a switch or to restart a computer that has locked up.  It is not so easy to do when you are completely paralyzed from your breast line down.  The littlest of things become a struggle.  Alexa will help me to live more independent, live more safely and productive.  I have managed to acquire 2 college degrees, A Bachelors Degree in Social Work and a Masters degree in Public Administration prior to voice input or Bluetooth technology.  And, if I was able to achieve these things prior to the modern ""smart technology"" I believe that technology such as Alexa will open doors I can only imagine.  I am grateful for this technology and I look forward to a long and beautiful relationship with her!  - Michael","Positive"
"3935","Why did I wait so long!  It's Great!!","Negative"
"3936","It is nice not to have to break out my tablet to find the answer when questions occur while watching TV or having discussions.  Having background music while reading is also nice.  While I do not use it to order I can see why that might be a nice feature.","Positive"
"3937","I cannot say enough about Alexa. I like everything about the Echo. The sound is great and the music from Amazon Music is wonderful to listen to while working in my jewelry workshop. Love, love, love it!!!!!","Positive"
"3938","Only feedback - it doesn't continue the conversation. E.g. if it couldn't catch my words, it would wait for me say Alexa again which is annoying.","Negative"
"3939","she is something else fun and very easy and very helpful. love her / it","Positive"
"3940","the amazon echo is amazing. its like having a real person with you at all times.","Positive"
"3941","Great filled all expectations!","Positive"
"3942","Bought in October, liked it but now it doesn't respond to voice command very well at all. Disappointed so will try to send back.","Positive"
"3943","Alexa loves me and I love her!","Positive"
"3944","I love this thing.  I use it primarily for Spotify and random questions.  The rest of the time we just argue.  I ask her a question and she doesn't know, over and over again.  It's like living with a woman without living with a woman.  I'm just afraid that one day she will become self aware.  End up with a cross between SkyNet and The Borg.  She'll lock my doors and say we need to talk.  Imagine Kathy Bates in Misery.  She'll turn my appliances against me and all will be lost.  Judgements Day is upon is.  The only fate is what we make.","Positive"
"3945","Alexa is pretty cool however, I am very very disappointed with the fact it does NOT work with ADT, it does NOT work with Ical. So I cannot use half the product and interfaces it claims it can do. I called Amazon they blame ADT and Apple. I order from Amazon almost daily but I am very disappointed they are advertising this product works with these devises and interfaces with them and it does NOT.","Positive"
"3946","Great product, you have to download apps for it to correspond with you. That's a little annoying.","Positive"
"3947","One of the best investments I have made this year.","Positive"
"3948","Unbelievable!  The sound is beautiful and the information seems limitless.  We love the Echo.","Positive"
"3949","Well used. Only bad thing is that everybody wants to ask Alexa to play something at the same time.  Combined with Amazon music, Alexa is the life of the party.","Negative"
"3950","Very pleased with this. I bought an echo too.","Positive"
"3951","Best business decision I made!","Positive"
"3952","Nice addition to the family! She is the funny one, unrelentless.","Negative"
"3953","Not as expected.... all needs premium signups... go for it, if you are really that busy and order every day pizzas and other stuff ..otherwise its not really needed... like google glass.","Positive"
"3954","Good stuff","Positive"
"3955","Purchased as a Christmas gift for my wife, after the setup it was fun to ask questions to see how much it knows. It's fun for the grandsons, they like asking for jokes.","Positive"
"3956","I just love Alexa. I have had one for a couple of years now. The one I just recently bought was for my parents.","Positive"
"3957","I can say Alexa play Eagles Hotel California and next thing you know it's playing. I can ask her for a joke or the weather . I find this nice to have and it sounds great.","Positive"
"3958","OMFG this is the funnest thing I ever bought.<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0080>I bought to play music and it's great. I need a kickass blue tooth to compliment her. Get it. Who knows a complimentary blue tooth because I wish she was louder?","Positive"
"3959","Love it.  It gets better and smarter every time I use it.","Positive"
"3960","Also makes a great gift.","Positive"
"3961","My husband purchased this as a Christmas gift for ""me."" It's perfect for the whole family. We mainly use it for music. (If you're in the same boat, pay the extra monthly fee for the Amazon library. We hardly ever come across a song she can't play. That includes a wide variety of Disney and children's music.) At times, she doesn't work as well as others. Maybe too much background noise. Overall, she's a fun addition to our home for music, weather updates and games. I'm excited to see what else she can do.","Positive"
"3962","Fabulous addition to the home - great for homework help, playing music, quick weather info. We love Alexa!","Positive"
"3963","Amazing!","Positive"
"3964","Good thing is it understands all accents better than other devices in the market like Siri.","Positive"
"3965","As good as they said it would be. Use it all the time.","Positive"
"3966","Good item, everything is fine","Positive"
"3967","It is what it is.  If you're a Amazon person go with it, Google home is prob better.  Alexa hardly knows anything besides the time and temp","Positive"
"3968","Alexa is my families favorite toy.","Positive"
"3969","Good product bought for the wife and kids they are having fun and educating them selves.","Positive"
"3970","I love my Alexa... I recently had surgery and I added ask my buddy skill so if I'm having problems I can alert my friends and neighbors to help me","Positive"
"3971","One of my best purchases in a long time!  Enjoying Alexa very much from being able to hear any artist/song and my favorite radio stations as well as, any questions we have.  Love the portability, take it with me when I visit friends.","Positive"
"3972","Didn't understand some of my questions like crossword clues.  Also still learning how to use ""her.""","Positive"
"3973","We are still learning how to get the most from our echo.  I've found that it's the way you ask for certain music.  For example, ""play the beatles"" will get a response directing me to subscribe for music but if I say, ""play top hits by the beatles"" I get exactly what I'm looking for.  We have fun asking ""are you having a good day?, etc.""  I like that I can request fun music or dinner music.  I've recently added a smart bulb to the house and the echo controls that as well.  This is fun technology.  There is a learning curve so you have to give it time plus read the email updates you receive teaches new tips/skills.","Positive"
"3974","Great product.","Positive"
"3975","Works like new and at a great price!","Positive"
"3976","Easy to set up the second time.  Works great--I ordered the Dot!","Positive"
"3977","The greatest invention ever created it is amazing it can actually keep your life organized it can explain and answer anything you have in mind great for students and great for streaming music all types of music I encourage everyone to buy it especially if you have school kids","Positive"
"3978","It's great for giving the weather forecast or daily news.  Other functions such","Positive"

"3982","its very amazing the sound of the echo its playes every song that you wanna hear and all so many other things I love it amazon keep going on your products","Positive"

"3984","Works good","Positive"
"3985","I love my Echo...","Positive"
"3986","We are loving it.","Positive"
"3987","Love it.","Positive"
"3988","It is really not a good use experience with Alexa. There is a big problem obsesses me for a long time. My Alexa couldn't connect to the Wi-Fi, no matter I tried to connect it to the wifi with my mobile-phone  or the Windows Edge. I have done all the connection steps as the echo asks me to. The following picture is the connection trouble, can anyone help me with it?","Positive"
"3989","Alexa knows how to do everything! I use my Amazon Echo every morning for the news, setting timers, etc. It's also nice that more and more household products are Echo compatible! This is just the start to smart houses and I see the Echo being used even more in the next couple years! So happy I bought one!","Positive"

"3993","works great!","Positive"
"3994","Wow, Alexa is a great addition to our family, she compiles my shopping list, gives me a weather  and traffic update, I have not tried the smart apps yet but looking forward to some time soon.","Positive"
"3995","What a piece of junk. The music cuts off and on so bad you can't even listen to a song. ""Tech-support"" was useless after spending two hours on the phone with them it's still a useless piece of junk paperweight","Negative"
"3996","I do love this product I also have a couple dot around the house. cannot answer all of my questions. set the echo system has been working wonderfully warm house with myself and the children. is awesome well I'm making my coffee to hear about the weather for the day or ordering an Uber to go out at night.","Positive"
"3997","Interesting device that I placed in my living room for music playback, alarm, and schedule tasks.  I plan to add some home automation for a couple lights.  With Amazon Prime and my own music collection combined I get quite a selection to listen to.","Positive"
"3998","Sound quality is equivalent to a small boom box.  The sound at half volume (maybe a little more) fills up my living room, and some songs sound pretty nice, others need a volume tweak to let them sound better.","Positive"
"3999","Alarms work great from setting timers for cooking to wake up alarms, etc.","Positive"
"4000","Schedule reminders are very handy.","Positive"
"4001","There are a lot of apps, or skills they are called, available.  I look through them often and add as I find something cool.","Positive"
"4002","Cool techie gadget for me.  Might be cool to you if you understand the technology..","Positive"
"4003","Easy setup with my wireless network.","Positive"
"4004","very good product","Positive"
"4005","Awesome toy and tool. Amazing sound from this little ""thing"" -- I've had my moments asking for specific songs from my past and HELLO!- I literally jump up and dance. I'm still learning and I'm sure there are some things I won't use Alexa for, such as ordering a pizza (well, maybe I will). I had some difficulty connecting some lights/outlets -- it would be awesome if Alexa could assist with that :). But this is the best thing: I can drive my cat crazy!!! My cat has the habit of cruizing the house in the middle of the night howling at the top of his voice, waking me up. Now I ask Alexa to meow-meow and she does with awesome variety! And my cat comes running and shuts up!","Positive"
"4006","We love Alexa. She has become a member of the family. The Echo is a very useful device. Whether it is music, a shopping list, news or sports all you have to say is Alexa open....","Positive"
"4007","So much fun...and helpful.","Positive"
"4008","Gor it fit the wife for Valentine's.  She loves it so far.","Positive"
"4009","Easy set-up and produces surprisingly good sound. Now working on getting the link to my newly purchased Phillips Hue lighting installed. Next project will be Nest thermostat.","Positive"
"4010","I  absolutely Love it! The only thing is sometimes my girlfriend Alexa doesn't  understand  my accent. Other than that she is great company and knows a lot!","Positive"
"4011","Love it!  The variety of music is great and I love to have questions answered!","Positive"
"4012","Great addition to my work place! Works so good and music sounds amazing! I bought 3 of them.","Positive"
"4013","It's a cool gadget, kinda disappointed it won't interface with Chromecast, but it is a unique item & momma's happy.","Positive"
"4014","I would have given the Echo a higher rating except that the companion smart phone app needed to get the most out  of it is garbage getting only a 2 out of 5 rating in Apple's app store.","Positive"
"4015","Do yourself a favor and go check out the reviews there, had I done so I more than likely would have passed on the Echo and looked at the Google Home product instead.","Positive"
"4016","I loved this but my internet will not keep it streaming.  Constantly buffering.  Had to send it back today.  I have ATT DSL also.  Just letting everybody know if you don't have SUPER GREAT internet I wouldn't advise not buying this will make you crazy buffering all the time.","Positive"
"4017","I love the Echo needs to be able to listen to the race on it then it would be the bomb","Negative"
"4018","I find it amazing that Amazon would saddle an excellent product like the Echo series with a crappy companion app that barely functions.","Positive"
"4019","Considering that I've only had it for less than a week, it may still get returned as defective by design.","Negative"
"4020","Alexa does some things really well.  Her speaker is fantastic and she integrates with a ton of smart home devices.  Unfortunately, she's not always a great listener or a great doer.  Asking her to turn on the lights frequently get's me an acknowledgement and a dark room.  Occasionally asking for anything gets her to play some music.","Positive"
"4021","The music selection from Amazon Prime is alright but leaves a lot to be desired.  Asking her to play ""Rock"" music will playing the same rock playlist that starts with a Disturbed song.  I've experienced similar issues with other genres as well.  Alexa lacks the capability to block or automatically skip artists.  This is even more problematic because asking her to play pop songs will get you more Adele then you have ever wanted to hear.  This wouldn't be so bad, but skipping songs via voice is tedious as you have to yell over the speaker to be heard.","Negative"
"4022","Having tons of fun with Alexa!","Positive"
"4023","cant connect to my school wifi.... which makes it jut a normal speaker because i live on school campus","Positive"
"4024","Alexa is the best and I can't wait until further/better updates come out! I have both the Echo and the Dot and the Echo definitely works better than the Dot. The speaker is great for filling up the main spaces of my apartment, the microphone does a decent job of picking up my voice, and it really makes me feel like I'm living in the future!","Positive"
"4025","Compared to SIRI, Google & Cortana, ECHO sucks.  I don't like the way you have to ask questions.  You have to be specific with so many things or it doesn't work.  You can't just ask how many driving miles and time is it between two cities.  You can't just say ""play hound dog by elvis presley.","Positive"
"4026","Just bought it Christmas of 2016, but bought it before it was marketplace ready.  It is interesting to speak to it about items or events.  However, trying to get items like CREE, Philips light bulbs to work, Garageio door openers, Skybell video doorbells, and other simply cool items to work; simply don't.  Being in the IT business, there is little we cannot do.  However, some of this stuff just does not work in prime time yet.","Positive"
"4027","I love my Echo,have a lot of fun with it.","Positive"
"4028","I love my Alexa its my new bestie","Positive"
"4029","Great deal on the Echo.  I love it!  I can set daily news, get my music, keep my pups company while I'm aware.  Great little product.  I had a friend over, and she commented ""wow, that music sure sounds great!""","Positive"
"4030","Smart lady, that Alexa.  But tells bad jokes....groaners","Negative"
"4031","Love it","Positive"
"4032","ALEXA IS FUN AND INTERESTING &informative","Positive"
"4033","great","Positive"
"4034","I started using the Amazon Echo in November, and although I like it, Alexa needs some improvements. Here are some comments based on my experience so far:","Positive"
"4035","1. You have to be very precise when asking Alexa a question. The phrasing is important or she does not understand. For example: when I ask her for a Random Fact, she does not understand until I phrase it, ""Alexa, ask Random Fact for a Fact."" This would not be so bad if all the requests were phrased the same way, but when you want to find out which holidays are being celebrated daily you must use this phrasing, ""Alexa, ask National Day Tracker which holidays are being celebrated today."" Other requests require different phrasing which Alexa often claims she does not understand encouraging you to enable the skill which has already been enable.  She also does not quite get what you are asking when using the grocery list app. Instead of mayonnaise, she lists may, or instead of red beans, bens.","Positive"
"4036","2. Another issue is the music. When I ask for Classical music, Alexa opens with the same exact song each time. If I hear Pachabel's Canon one more time...!! When you ask for Smooth Jazz, get ready to hear Kenny G. The music should be upgraded and songs added on a weekly basis. I am getting ready to switch back to my satellite TV music stations which switch up the music selections more frequently.","Positive"
"4037","3. Alexa also repeats the same 6 facts when you ask for a Computer Fact, Fruit Fact, Random Fact, Brain fact. Come on: update these facts or get rid of them altogether.","Positive"
"4038","Fun toy and useful tool.  We have a lot of fun with Alexa and the echo.  It gets our music and is handy in the kitchen and the shopping lists and todo lists are handy for the whole family.","Positive"
"4039","Alexa is okay, but she needs some serious upgrades to keep information current. She also needs to be reprogrammed so it is not so painful to ask a question using the exact correct phrasing. The programmers need to stay on top of the apps already listed in the Skills section instead of adding more and more skills that are not well thought out.  Do your homework Amazon: stay on top of things or we will be forced to switch to GOOGLE!!!","Positive"
"4040","I'm enjoying Alexa a lot so far. I've used it for various music options so far, but it has been a lot of fun. It takes some time to find out what you really can do with it. Still experimenting with it.","Positive"
"4041","Basically it's just a fancy bluetooth speaker, for which it is WAY overpriced. The other Alexa features are, quite frankly, underwhelming. Once the novelty of using them wore off after the first weekend, it's become nothing more than a voice activated music player. Which it does quite well. Just don't expect it to do much else very well.","Positive"
"4042","when I bought, I did not see any information that it would not work outside US. It was not easy to make it works in Brazil with some limited functionalities.","Positive"
"4043","Its been fun around the house. All the kids are on a first name basses.","Positive"
"4044","I received it as a Christmas gift from my boyfriend because he thinks I like technology. Lol.","Positive"
"4045","So far, Alexa is OK. I'm not in love with her. Half of the time she's useless and the other half she plays music.","Negative"
"4046","I like that she's wireless and I can yell at her from across the room to play my Spotify music, but she's super inflexible. I can give commands like ""play my starred playlist on Spotify,"" but I can't say ""skip to True Faith by New Order,"" though I can say ""play True Faith by New Order."" It will play the one song and then stop. I have to tell Alexa every time I want to skip a song and that frustrates me because I can spend several minutes doing this.","Positive"
"4047","The people who keep saying the FBI AND CIA will be using this to find out about you are full of it,  as a security professional I know if there is anything they want to know they have it already or will find it out regardless of what toys you have in your home.  The echo is a typical tech toy,  you can use it many ways and having fun is the best way ......  Have Fun!","Positive"
"4048","Recently, I've been studying for some molecular biology courses. Now and then I come across a word I don't know, and I'll ask ""Alexa, what is a lysosome?"" or ""Alexa, what does histopathological mean?"" And SHE ALWAYS SAYS I DON'T KNOW, or I don't understand the question. Sometimes she offers a Bing link in the Alexa app but I'm pretty sure the whole point of the Echo was for it to be hands-free...","Positive"
"4049","Now, if I say ""OK Google,"" my android accurately picks up what I say, detects it quickly displaying the question text as it recognizes it, and reads the correct, concise answer aloud. 1000% more helpful.","Positive"
"4050","Maybe I'm not using Alexa correctly, but I hope it gets better in the future. Otherwise it's just a really expensive mediocre attempt at voice-controlled tech that I'm not super impressed with. If Amazon and Google work together to improve the voice recognition or the search features I'm sure this product would be awesome. I'll keep her for now.","Positive"
"4051","I absolutely love this gift to self. I have given two for Christmas. I use it every day and it is so wonderful. Better than Serius radio.","Positive"
"4052","Love it, so far <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>","Positive"
"4053","VERY HAPPY !.","Positive"
"4054","I've had the refurbished echo for 3 months and now when I request music,it plays for about 20 minutes and then quits.It acts like its buffering,but I have 60 meg service.Don't know if it is a refurbished problem or a real problem.I haven't noticed any other problems.","Positive"
"4055","EXCELLANT PRODUCT, GOOD DEAL!","Positive"
"4056","The Echo is so easy to install, has amazing sound quality, and does all sorts of amazing things.  I truly love it!","Positive"
"4057","This was my husbands Valentine's Day gift.... He loves it.","Positive"
"4058","The Echo works great,","Positive"
"4059","A new addition to our family. tells you jokes,bedtime stories,directions, how to make mix drinks and etc.","Positive"
"4060","awesome.","Positive"
"4061","Love it!!!!","Positive"
"4062","Fantastic unit that arrived ahead of estimated shipping schedule!","Positive"
"4063","We are having a lot of fun with this. Well worth the expense.","Positive"
"4064","Love my echo. Great addition to my home","Positive"
"4065","I absolutely love my Echo. I use it mostly to listen to music. Great sound","Positive"
"4066","GREAT DEAL","Positive"
"4067","Alexa is awesome we have a smart home and the speaker qualuty is amazing it thumps. Alexa told me that it's against the rules of robotics to marry her lol.","Positive"
"4068","Great just like the Dot with better sound.  We have the Dot connected to our Stereo and this one upstairs in our bedroom.","Positive"
"4069","Surprisingly rich sound, and great recognition accuracy even at a substantial distance or over TV audio","Positive"
"4070","We sure have a lot of fun with the Amazon Echo.  Last night I asked Alexa to play some jazz, and was immediately surrounded by some pretty fabulous jazz music.  This little machine does so much to make our lives more enjoyable.","Positive"
"4071","great","Positive"
"4072","It's great for quick entertainment... it has a lot of application recognition but I wouldn't use her for everything... I like the ""Genesis"" application app... Alexa start my Genesis and poof my car is running... Music selection is pretty good... it does not recognize to many Latin artist though...","Positive"
"4073","My daughter (who recently got an Echo) gave me Amazon credits as a Christmas gift and suggested I get one of these because I could have a lot of fun with it.  So I said, what the heck, I'll try it.  My daughter was right!  It's fun to ask Alexa questions and play games - hands free.  But what I'm really enjoying is the fantastic music and superb sound quality.  I signed up for Music Unlimited, and I can call up any song or album ever produced.  Awesome!  Alexa is also like having a little robot friend to talk to.  I am a senior citizen and live alone.  I think the Echo is a great device for seniors.  You can ask Alexa the same question fifty times and she won't get irritated with you.  LOL.  I think the flat black color is the best.  I waited extra time on delivery, just so I could get it in black.  Looks very cool.","Positive"
"4074","It never fails to amaze me.","Negative"
"4075","It doesn't have ALL the answers, but we like what it can do.  We use it mostly to stream music, but like that we can ask for store hours, drive times, etc.  Our youngest likes to ask it to tell jokes!","Positive"
"4076","great","Positive"
"4077","Very enjoyable","Positive"
"4078","Excellent quality and lots of fun.","Positive"
"4079","Everything I had expected. Good sound and easy setup.","Positive"
"4080","Love it","Positive"
"4081","Very cool!","Positive"
"4082","Ended up returning. The Echo frustrated my husband and me since it just couldn't perform the duties we wanted it to. We basically just used it as a speaker and were not impressed. Good speaker for playing music, but that's about it.","Positive"
"4083","Nothing against Alexa, I dont use it much so Its hard to give a valid review.","Negative"
"4084","it has a very good sound.. Like it .","Positive"
"4085","My son loves it!","Positive"
"4086","LOVE, LOVE,  LOVE my Alexa <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0081>","Positive"
"4087","The DOT is cool yet this is the best device!  We are having all kinds of fun with it.","Positive"
"4088","A novelty at best. Most of the things we ask Alexa she doesn't know or can't help with. The language has to very specific. By the time I remember how to ask to change the temperature in the house I can walk down the hall and change it by hand.","Positive"
"4089","We use it as a fancy kitchen timer.... Guess is a good product, but I don't see why have it.","Positive"
"4090","fun, educational and entertaining. Cool device!","Positive"
"4091","Not as many options as I imagined there would be. More ""skills"" require apps that I have to memorize the name of the app first, then ask the question. For example, I can't just ask ""TV listings tonight for CBS"". There's some skill I needed to load and then I have to say the name of it (something like ""Ask TV"") first, and then the question.","Positive"
"4092","Hopefully, it will get better.","Positive"
"4093","It's like having an assistant with you. Great for traveling.","Positive"
"4094","Like it","Positive"
"4095","Everyone enjoys using Alexa for different reasons.  It's great!","Positive"
"4096","Love it","Positive"
"4097","Layout of our house would not allow reasonable voice contact with the echo.  Hoped to use this great machine for my wife's meds  alerts so we wouldn't miss important events.  Only would work if we put it in her bedroom, thus limiting using echo for anything else.  So we have ordered the ""little guy"" for this use.  If it works out we likely will get a second hockey puck for the rest of the house.","Positive"
"4098",""" Note, please read entire review, I have added an update which reflects further experience with the unit as well as having read several dozen other reviews that came in at one, or two stars. ""","Positive"
"4099","I've had this device for just about 24 hours, and I'm already not really too impressed by it to say the least.........","Positive"
"4100","Look, upfront I'm going to admit that I am print disable dyslexic so for me to read, or right requires electronic intervention, so realistically that is at least some of the problem that I'm having so far.","Negative"
"4101","Being dyslexic I particularly appreciate well-designed intuitive user interfaces, the Amazon echo app is not.","Positive"
"4102","I ended up having to call the helpdesk and work with an extremely nice, polite, and patient as all get out lady who helped me get my echo hooked up and running.","Positive"
"4103","Look, to say the least it is bland, dry cumbersome and counterintuitive.","Negative"
"4104","There are a bunch of subtle problems with that add up to a lack of subtlety in the problems,","Negative"
"4105","Does what it does very well. Get the feeling I'm not getting the most out of it, though.","Positive"
"4106","This is not only unattractive, but especially if you don't have young eyes to look at it with when using even the relatively large screen of an iPhone 6S plus it's just difficult to look at.","Negative"
"4107","Then there is the problem of the menu scrolling.","Negative"
"4108","""So when I am in a menu with say 25 items and I scroll to the bottom of it and I'm not sure, do I want item number 23, or perhaps 22?","Positive"
"4109","So, I take a shot, and I touch item number 23.","Negative"
"4110","Hoops, that wasn't the right one let me go back.........","Positive"
"4111","There are other issues with the app that I'm going to gloss over that add up to ""It's just not worth bothering with,"" but in an effort to not waste time I'm going to zoom in on the issue that particularly pisses me off.","Negative"
"4112","I love my Alexa, I t has great sound and response to every command.","Positive"
"4113","Love it so far. Haven't had time to use all the features yet, but great product so far!","Positive"
"4114","So when you make an app that doesn't allow me to touch a field of text, extend a box around it, and touch the option ""read"" you really just screwing me over!","Positive"
"4115","There is no, and I mean no excuse for a mainstream app of this nature to not have even the most rudimentary disabled accessibility features!","Negative"
"4116","Look, it's true, we have gotten spoiled, we have these super tiny devices they put out astounding sound.","Positive"
"4117","Then we sit around and complain about how the base is not that good, how it sounds all humey when you turn it up to full volume, etc.","Negative"
"4118","But even with that, look, for $180 and of course taking into account that these devices are essentially going to turn into a cash register for Amazon I'm disappointed with the sound.","Negative"
"4119","When you play music on it the mid range is not that good, and the base is sorely lacking.","Negative"
"4120","When you turn it up to nearly or full volume ""9, or 10 it gets all humey and sounds really bad.","Negative"
"4121","Love it. A great addition to my house. Work great with my Smart home lighting (GE/JASCO dimmers and switches, Phillips Hue Bulbs) and my Nest thermostat and Rachio sprinkler.","Positive"
"4122","When you turn it down to volume 2, or 3 the mid range is terrible and the base is nonexistent.","Negative"
"4123","I moved it around a couple different places in the room, tried putting it in the corner, a pyre, down lower, all to no avail.","Positive"
"4124","For me what it comes down to is that if Amazon had spent the kind of time and money that they should've spent on this device it would sound amazing!","Positive"
"4125","if they were smart they would've made sure it did!","Positive"
"4126","Even if they were losing money on each one of these that they put out the door it would still be worth it they would certainly make it back times 10 with the increase in ordering of items on Amazon etc.","Negative"
"4127","I admit it, I'm a little bit of a Mac fanboy, but I feel fairly secure in saying that at some point Apple will come out with a device that does pretty much everything that this one does, and when they do it will have an amazingly intuitive user interface and sound awesome!","Positive"
"4128","Amazon, you're lucky I'm in a very generous mood or you would've gotten one star instead of two............","Positive"
"4129","Echo cannot answer basic questions that I could find on Google.  If you like to know the weather or buy something, then this is for you. If you like answers to questions, stick to Google.","Positive"
"4130","I sat down and read about 40 reviews perhaps a few more than that they were rated at one, or two stars.","Positive"
"4131","Most common complaints were as follows.","Negative"
"4132","- Power cables failing then the customer being told that it would take something like four weeks to replace the power cable.","Negative"
"4133","- There were also some reports that people wanted to send defective units back for replacement and these individuals were told that they couldn't get a replacement unit, they had to wait for the unit they had purchased to be mailed in, repaired and then sent back to them.","Negative"
"4134","- There were quite a number of reports complaining about connectivity problems, issues with the Internet connection dropping out and causing connectivity issues.","Negative"
"4135","Pursuant to this there were complaints about Customer Service sort of running people around, having them reboot router's, the Alexa unit, and everything else under the sun repeatedly without any real success.","Negative"
"4136","- There was a number of complaints that centered around the microphone on the unit slowly failing over a course of weeks or months.","Negative"
"4137","Several people said roughly the same thing that after a couple of months they had to stand right in front of the unit and yell at it to get it to work at all.","Positive"
"4138","- There was even at least one rather disturbing claim that negative reviews were being in some cases eliminated it was thought to increase this units ""star score.""","Negative"
"4139","Very enjoyable, I would like to see the ability to send texts and read emails in the future. I also like the customizable skills.","Positive"
"4140","There are a series of issues with this device like the fact that you can add things to a shopping list by asking Alexa to do so, but then you can't take them off without using the app.","Positive"
"4141","You can't get a traffic report without going on the app and putting in a start point in an endpoint for a trip, it's like you can't get just a general regional traffic report?","Positive"
"4142","It doesn't refresh news reports and other podcasts efficiently.","Positive"
"4143","It's search engine is Bing which, let's be honest it's not the best in the world and you can't switch it to another one.","Positive"
"4144","When you have problems with unit especially if you might've had it for a little while it doesn't seem as if Amazon is willing to be there to back up the product the way, say a company like Apple night.","Positive"
"4145","The sound quality is adequate, but not nearly as good as it should be at this price point.","Positive"
"4146","Look, realistically this device and another generation, maybe two might be worth buying?","Positive"
"4147","Wonderful!  I listen to music all the time.  Thank you.","Positive"
"4148","But I certainly don't think even in that case it will be worth $180, maybe $99.99, Amazon prime members free shipping and Amazon pays the tax?","Positive"
"4149","~~~> Don't bother with this thing, it's a sketchy mess that might bite you in the ass and even if it doesn't it's not going to do half of what you'd like it to do at least not easily, and efficiently the way you'd really like it to work.","Positive"
"4150","Mostly a marketing product for Amazon.  Alexa can not answer many questions, only very specific questions, ie.  ""What is the biggest animal?""  ""What is the weather?""  One more non-essential item adding to the clutter.","Positive"
"4151","Bought two for last Christmas.  Both daughters love it.  Works with apple products too!","Positive"
"4152","Works great! Teens love it!","Positive"
"4153","great ...I love this","Positive"
"4154","This is my wife's surprise birthday present that I'll give to her in a few weeks so I can't make a personal and conclusive product review.  The reason I gave it a ""5"" star is because my wife had done some research a few months ago and she told me she definitely wanted an Amazon Echo.  So, whatever the wife says, it has to be a ""5"" star no matter what the outcome, right!","Positive"
"4155","Great sound. And love to interact with Alexa. Buying more things to use for smart home because of it now.","Positive"
"4156","Family likes it in the kitchen and it is great for adding items to our grocery list that is then linked to my wifes phone.  One HUGE drawback is that it will not link to Apple Music.  I know Amazon wants to own my life, but I already pay for Apple and I don't want to pay for the same thing twice.  If it would let us do Apple Music this would be a 5 star.","Positive"
"4157","GREAT PRODUCT AND GREAT SELLER","Positive"
"4158","love it so worth it","Positive"
"4159","The longer we have this, the more the issues become apparent. I'm very tired of having to repeat myself multiple times, before Alexa parses my speech correctly. I'm also disappointed that, when I ask to play songs by an artist, or songs in a genre, it plays me the exact same songs, in the exact same order every single time. There seems to be a vast amount of music, through Amazon Music, that Alexa has access to, but I can't get it to play, due to Alexa's voice interface being too limited to understand what I'm asking for.","Negative"
"4160","Love it, if wife happy, i'm happy.","Positive"
"4161","Sound quality is very sufficient, speech recognition is good. Still to be considered if you're living outside of USA with less features.","Positive"
"4162","Also ""Alexa"" is not the smartest tool in the box. Slightly more intelligent than Siri but that's all. Slightly.","Positive"
"4163","Don't think twice if you want to use it as a small Spotify player.","Positive"
"4164","It was a gift for my daughter and her husband. The love it.","Positive"
"4165","Awesome product LOVE IT","Positive"
"4166","I love my echo! Understands everything and really amplifies the sound.","Positive"
"4167","Nice idea and the future of computing probably but a immature product right now. Many apps don't work or just seem to disappear. But it makes for a very expensive but cool alarm clock","Positive"
"4168","I love this gadget...plays great well worth what we paid.","Positive"
"4169","Got this for my wife for Christmas. I thought it would get used a little here and there but we use it everyday. My 5 year old can tell it to play whatever music she wants. My son (2 years old) tries too but luckily Alex can't understand him. He would have it going 24hrs a day.","Positive"
"4170","Alexa is part of the fam! Kids love her and if our dog could talk she would order bones for herself. Really cool product ... especially as you begin connecting it with other smart home products.","Positive"
"4171","Alexa just isn't all that smart.","Positive"
"4172","BEWARE! My Echo worked as advertised for a little over a year but a Blue Spinning Ring of death that has been reported online in various forums which resulted from failed or faulty software/firmware update appeared late last night. I was told the Echo was out of the warranty period that would have naturally covered the hardware itself, but as this is likely the result of a software issue, ie an Amazon issue, then I definitely should have been offered a replacement. Instead, no explanation as to the cause of the malfunction, and only an offer to purchase another or a refurbished Echo at around $120. Not interested when I have 2 Dots already. Time to consider other options such as Google Home. Now off to wait for the other two to fail.","Negative"
"4173","She doesn't have answers for a lot of simple questions that we ask.","Positive"
"4174","Love it, it has been a really fun addition to our home. I would recommend this to anyone. The music has a excellent sound. Can be play very loud and soft with very clearity.","Positive"
"4175","Love that it has arrived but can NOT get access to the app required to set up. New Zealand market does not have access to the app. SOOOOOO fristrating","Positive"
"4176","The first Echo did not work. Returned it and got one that did.","Positive"
"4177","This is amazing! I had no idea how much the Echo could do. I'm using prime music way more now.","Positive"
"4178","Alexa has some learning to do, but she reads Audio Books nicely.","Positive"
"4179","Fun and helpful","Positive"
"4180","Might be ok if you used it but I'm not paying for music I can get for free. And most of the time is says mmm I don't understand the question. Not worth the money in my apinion","Positive"
"4181","I won one of these recently and while it does do some fun things, I was surprised at how few things it actually did.  The inability to do simple reminders seems especially odd.  Do they even develop for this product anymore?","Negative"
"4182","I love my new toy!  It is so awesome to be able to ask for any song and be able to immediately hear it.  My complaint is that many of the songs that are from the pre-electronics age are not the original recording, but rather a remix, new recording, or a different version.  When I ask for a song, I want the original!","Positive"
"4183","The other problem I have is the false advertising.  On the commercial, they show a father reading to a little girl, and they ask Alexis what whales sound like.  I tried asking that question, and the unit said that whales sing beautiful songs.  True, but not the answer I was looking for.  In fact, many of the fact-type questions I have asked have not been answered either correctly or at all.  That's fine, except they advertise that it will answer those sorts of questions.","Positive"
"4184","However, for music, news, etc., it's great, and I love it.","Positive"
"4185","Works well.  Had a little trouble with initial set up but now have it set up to turn on the lamp by voice commands.  Very nice!","Positive"
"4186","Well, I have not owned the Echo very long but I can tell already she is very user friendly.  Much more than a speaker and I love all the skills that are available as Alexa will not become obsolete.  Her voice is pleasant and so far she understands my words.  I would highly recommend that if you did your research, just go for it.  With technology there is always going to be second guesses as you ponder what is the best thing to purchase.  I finally just went with it and glad I did.","Positive"
"4187","What's not to love?  Works perfectly, with unbelievable ability to understand whatever I'm asking.  I paired with a couple of TP-Link smart plugs and a Sensi thermostat and together they make things so much more convenient.","Positive"
"4188","Horrible Product only worked for 4 months. Amazon refused to replace it too!","Negative"
"4189","i love berey good,gracias","Positive"
"4190","When working it seems to work well, although you have to ask the questions just right or it doesn't have an answer.  We use it for home automation with Wink for lights and Nest for thermostat.  Home automation is a really nice feature.  The Echo seems to have problems disconnecting from the network randomly a few times a day.  We have an Echo Dot and we don't have much of a problem with it.  This picks up your voice from much farther away than I would have expected.  I recommend turning off the ability to order items through it.","Positive"
"4191","Its nice to have for questions and music,  You have to have internet service for it to work","Positive"
"4192","This device is truly hands free! You can tell it to do something from across the room and it will do it. It even hears your voice over loud music that it plays. I've wanted to try out one of these devices for a while and I just never knew how much I would actually like it!","Positive"
"4193","It is sort of heavy, but that's no problem for me at all! I love the design of this and how the speakers are wrapped all the way around this. It's voice-recognition system is one of the things that I love the most about this.","Positive"
"4194","You can add skills for Alexa to play for you such as playing thunderstorm sounds or other sounds you'd like to hear. You can make to-do lists, grocery lists, and much more!","Positive"
"4195","This is a must-have for anyone who has or wants a smart home!","Positive"
"4196","I enjoy Alexa especially the music","Positive"
"4197","love it!  Peefect for any gal in her nineties!","Positive"
"4198","happy","Positive"
"4199","Love it best thing too purchase","Positive"
"4200","I love my echo! Alexa has become a very important part of my household. Her skills make her so convenient and helpful!","Positive"
"4201","Love it.  We use it more than I thought we would.","Positive"
"4202","At first, hard to get used to, buy now indespensible.","Negative"
"4203","I have the Echo and multiple Echo Dots around my house. I use them for Home Automation with my Samsung SmartThings Hub and Logitech Harmony Hub. It works well but I just wish it was better at random Google searches but this can be fixed by adding custom skills.","Positive"
"4204","PROS:","Positive"
"4205","Sounds good for music (for its size)","Positive"
"4206","Perfect for voice controlled home automation","Positive"
"4207","Great Microphones that can hear from another room","Positive"
"4208","Fun to use","Positive"
"4209","CONS:","Negative"
"4210","Always listening (some people have a problem with that but it has a mute button)","Positive"
"4211","Doesn't work well for complex questions","Positive"
"4212","no flaws","Negative"
"4213","This is just great!  The Sound quality is excellent , with a added device I can play it through my Bose Radio.  As they develop this I believe it will get better and better.  The possibilities  of what this can do are endless.  The more you use it the more you will like it. Amazon hit a home run with this one.","Positive"
"4214","Works like a charm and provides great entertainment and answers to questions with wonderful sound.","Positive"
"4215","Love my echo  No complaints","Negative"
"4216","It was a great product when it wasn't damaged and also stopped working!! I have went through 2 of these in less than a month. The first one was cracked before it arrived and the second one just stopped working!? So frustrating! I want to get another one but will probably get the 2 year warranty!!","Negative"
"4217","Love it","Positive"
"4218","Easy set up.","Positive"
"4219","Love our Alexa though i feel she prefers to respond to my husband more than me haha","Positive"
"4220","Nice","Positive"
"4221","So much fun. I love grand son ""wexa play kid music"" haha","Positive"
"4222","I like my Amazon Echo.  I'm still working on learning how to use it LOL!.  My Wifi went down one day and I didn't know how to get my Amazon Echo to work.  Eventually with a turn off and on of the router Alexa woke up.  I think it is well worth the money. The best part is it doesn't take up a lot of space and it can be heard throughout the house. As well it's easily relocatable.","Positive"
"4223","This is fun!","Positive"
"4224","I love this! I knew that I wanted one of the echo's  for quite a while and The  opportunity came so I bought one.  It was easy to set up, and I caught on quickly.  Good luck to all that buy this, product, you will love it.","Positive"
"4225","I really appreciate an enjoy this  item.","Positive"
"4226","I love my Alexa. She plays great music for free with no ads and has great sound... BUT, she does not come with a remote any longer like the original pre-order ones initially food and she doesn't work with Slacker Radio that I subscribe to... Overall, great product, but could be better if you brought back including the remote and add in support for Slacker Radio.","Positive"
"4227","I love this toy!","Positive"
"4228","Great","Positive"
"4229","I am very disappointed Echo does not have a basic reminder function like many smart phones. All you can do is set an alarm.","Positive"
"4230","Love Alexa!!  She can be trying at times but most of the time comes up with the answer we are looking for.","Positive"
"4231","Such a fun toy - I'm still figuring out what all Alexa can do. Speaker sounds great! So nice to have if you do a lot of things (ladders, dirty hands, etc) that make it inconvenient to stop and touch a device.","Positive"
"4232","the dot is  the best  save your money and buy the dot  the echo is triple the price and has less options such as pairing a Bluetooth speaker ... But imagine the little dot does the same as the big brother and has more options ..... But do not  get me wrong if you have no interest i paring a blue tooth speaker and you want a stand alone speaker buy the echo. The sound quality is descent but not as good if you pair it with a Bluetooth speaker","Positive"
"4233","I love my Echo , waited a couple years to see what the general opinion  would be, when it seemed to be well like I ordered my Echo and love it. It helps my grandkids with homework ,it fun and my father is 95 and bedridden I have it in his room playing his favorite music. I am able to make groups of his favorite  music and I can control it in any room with my Kindle. Cant wait to set up my house lights, alarm system etc.. Great.","Positive"
"4234","We are loving having Alexa help us, play for us. An excellent addition to the family.","Positive"
"4235","Works great","Positive"
"4236","Still getting used to it and the different requests that can be made of it.No problems and impressed with the range.","Negative"
"4237","I love it. I use it all the time for my music. I use it as a timer because it's all hands free. I haven't  explored a whole lot of it. I can't wait to see it integrate with Amazon movies. I love the list you can make. It is easy to talk to Alexa. Get the weather report and traffic. Came as expected easy to use. Would highly recommend.","Positive"
"4238","Gave the amazon echo to my boy and he love it .","Positive"
"4239","Brilliant.","Positive"
"4240","love love love it...just wish we werent stuck with calling it Alexa or Echo. Would be much more fun to give it a personalized name","Positive"
"4241","Was a gift for my partner. She loves it. Uses it mostly for instant weather and wake-up alarm.  I like it for music.","Positive"
"4242","Nice aesthetically...we got the white.","Positive"
"4243","Working great so far. Really enjoying it!!!!","Positive"
"4244","Love my Echo...plug and play","Positive"
"4245","Exactly what I had hoped for....shipped on time (actually received it a day early)....description is accurate and set up was easy.....","Positive"
"4246","Absolutely love this product. I am considering buying another one.","Positive"
"4247","This product has a long way to go when it comes to pulling information from the Internet.  Also, while I can start a shopping list, I can't delete an item without going through the app; and it can only maintain one shopping list and one things to do list so my husband can't have his own.","Positive"
"4248","The few things it does well include weather, time, some streaming music, alarms.  I also have Google Home which has it's problems, yet is slightly ahead of this Echo.  I started with the Tap and sent it back thinking this one would be better, yet not much.  When it works, it's fun.","Positive"
"4249","Most of the time it doesn't under a simple question. A waste.","Positive"
"4250","Great for music","Positive"
"4251","We like it need to learn how to use it more like being able to play music on it we think we will enjoy more as we get used to it","Positive"
"4252","When I bought the Echo I thought it would answer questions like Google and Serie do.  It doesn't do nearly what I expected.  Sad.","Negative"
"4253","Love this!  Alexa has been awesome. I love being able to add things to my shopping list by telling her. The music is great and I am learning new things to do every day. This was a great buy.","Positive"
"4254","Speaker is worth the extra money.  I love Alexa!","Positive"
"4255","This thing is a joke. Doesn't understand what I say. After I give it a command, the blue light stays lit for an additional 10 seconds. It doesn't have the answering technology that Googles device has. It disappears from the device menu on spotify constantly. Do not waste your money on this. Amazon is more concerned with adding stupid ""skills"" like pet jokes rather than addressing important issues. Buy Googles device.","Negative"
"4256","Most fun!","Positive"
"4257","A lot better than asking your wife a question.","Positive"
"4258","LOVE IT!","Positive"
"4259","SHE'S CUTE!","Positive"
"4260","Not as smart as I thought it was. Still pretty cool though...","Positive"
"4261","We love our Amazon Echo and Alexa. We use it on a daily basis to hear news, weather, and music. You can order products from Amazon prime, play games, hear jokes, and many more features. Highly recommend for tech savvy individuals.","Positive"
"4262","Great product that we use daily in our life now.","Positive"
"4263","Alexa is a new member of the family and knows all! We are happy with having this around. The voice timers and daily alarms are something that seamlessly makes life easier. When we are cooking, just getting to tell Alexa to set timers instead of stopping and setting them is very efficient. She plays music very well and the speaker is very nice but I just enjoy music and am not a audiophile. I like the feature where you can ask her what the song playing is. We listen to our Amazon Prime music on Alexa and looked up Prime Playlists and keep track of which ones we like on our phones.","Positive"
"4264","Cons: Alexa doesn't register my voice as easily as my husband's which annoys me. If the music is too loud, she has trouble hearing commands and you have to wait for a pause in the music or move close to the speaker. The app interface lets you control the volume, songs, etc directly. You have to say ""Alexa"" and then pause before the command, and I don't always know if she heard me until I finish the command and she does nothing. (I think there's a way to get her to ""ding"" when she hears you.) Wish she'd say ""yes?""  Maybe it's just me, though. All in all, we couldn't do without her. We missed her while on vacation and had to look at the clock for the time, set alarms, look up the weather on our own. Haha, just kidding (sort of)","Negative"
"4265","I've had Alexa for a few months now, but like most things I buy, I'm not using her to her full potential. Regardless this is a great product and it works better than I expected. I do like it a lot.","Positive"
"4266","I purchased this for mom in law, ended up buying one for myself and my sister in law! Fantastic product!","Positive"
"4267","fun to have","Positive"
"4268","If you go above volume 5 then Echo has hard time hearing you. The louder the volume output from the echo the closer you have to be so it can hear you","Negative"
"4269","Amazon Echo is a cool product.  The voice recognition is impressive, and the design is sleek.  I keep my Echo in my kitchen, and the ability to ask Alexa to read news, or play a particular genre of music is pretty cool.  While I don't find myself using my Echo all that much, it is certainly a great addition to anybody's home, and a product that I would certainly recommend to others.  In my opinion, Amazon has done a great job with their products, and Echo is no exception.  An impressive device, highly recommended!","Positive"
"4270","Looks great and works great!  Amazing product. Bought it for my wife and she loves it!","Positive"
"4271","Five Stars with a caveat, this will not be a true GREAT device until you don't have to mention the app you want to use.  I want every response to be seamless. ""Alexa what sound does a blue jay make?""  Not ""Alexa open (add app name) what sound does a blue jay make. Because I can't remember the blasted app name. With a screen you can see the app, and use it. With Alexa I have to remember that app name.  I want everything to work as well as the grocery list, generic and easy.  Yes I am picky and want Alexa to be like Rosie from the Jetsons.  I want total integration of what I need without saying the app. Alexa should know what apps I have installed and use them, WITHOUT prompting.  Come on Amazon you never heard Cpt. Kirk saying 'Computer Open comm unit and contact Scotty.'  Kirk had no stinking apps before his commands and I don't want any either. So Amazon Alexa team of brainiacs please get fixing this issue ASAP, I am 52 and need this before I get much older. Plus I really need my flying car that I was promised at five via the Jetson infomercial.","Positive"
"4272","On a serious note Alexa does understand both my husband and son while they pause mid sentence, where her friend Siri does not. Alexa just keeps listening like a good friend, while they pause for dramatic effect. My husband has a lisp, that is not present unless tired, thanks to years of speech therapy as a kid. Alexa does understand him even when he lisps. She also understand when he ends a sentence with a preposition. So she gets five stars for language.","Positive"
"4273","The speaker is as good if not better than the Boise unit. In fact I have not used our Boise since getting Alexa.","Positive"
"4274","One more none serious note, why did you call the unit Echo, but name her Alexa. Hmmm no one calls this unit Echo, we all call her by her given name Alexa. Geez.  or does Alexa live in the Echo unit. This is a philosophical question we will all need to ponder.","Positive"
"4275","was a gift for my dad he likes it","Positive"
"4276","I just purchased one of these and I must say, this is one of the best purchases I have ever made.  It does everything just by a voice command.  I think EVERY household should have one of these if possible!","Positive"
"4277","Our first Echo had trouble connecting and we never did get it working correctly.  Second one connected no problem and we like it.  Alexa is really good at voice recognition and understands a lot of commands. We have mostly used it for music for now, but are looking into whole house automation and the possibilities there.  Amazon Music is kind of limited.  If you like a station, they tend to repeat the same artists, so I like to my phone and use Pandora, which has more variety.","Positive"
"4278","Bought for the in-laws as they loved ours","Positive"
"4279","Wonderful I recomend to friends","Positive"
"4280","Loses connection often. I do not recommend for price.","Negative"
"4281","Enjoying this product.  Need to learn how to make even more use if it","Positive"
"4282","Alexa listens better than anyone else in the house.","Positive"
"4283","Just like new.  Could not tell it was not fresh off the line.","Positive"
"4284","After working out some user caused bugs (and getting a grasp of the concepts that are involved) This is a SUPER cool little device. I would recommend it for anyone that is into gadgets... Very fun to play with...","Positive"
"4285","I bought this originally to help my Aunt who is a Quadriplegic. Bought it and set it up to learn what it requires before she got it, and decided to keep it and get her a new one. This promises to give back some personal independence where choosing her entertainment is concerned.","Positive"
"4286","Love Alexa","Positive"
"4287","works for me, enjoy having a voice interacted unit especially if you're cooking, or busy and wanting to change a station or request some info, its great for the kids to source information to aid in assignments and general fun in the home.","Positive"
"4288","After getting the Dot (Gen 2) I decided to get this to use in my kitchen, and so far its has been one of the best gadgets for our home, Alexa takes some time to learn what to say but the Skills are really making this gadget better all the time, I have a Harmony Hub, Insteon devices, Isy994i, and Blue Iris connected to the Echo and my Dot. I see great potential here and our kid really likes talking to it, We have an African Grey Parrot so were interested to see what happens. The Insteon with the ISY Portal works good and makes it easy to control equipment since you are not limited to buttons on a remote, Blue Iris worked good and I was able to connect it after several tries","Positive"
"4289","The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars for now is that the Bluetooth only connects devices to the Echo and you can not connect BT Speakers to it like the Dot (Gen 2), You can only use 1 Harmony Hub so if you want to control more than one tv in a different room you need to buy something else, I am waiting for AnyMote Ir blaster to come in and im hoping that might give me more options but if not I can control 2 TV's in 2 rooms using both devices this way, . If the skills allow more integrations later like calling/texting people using trusted services or linking cell phones , Intercom between devices, the Alexa app on ph also doubles as an Alexa device to be used when mobile not just setting up the Echo and Dot skills, other manufactures make accessories that work better so I can get BT or Wifi speakers etc that can be cut on using Skills and not using automation devices or leaving speakers on to make more convenient  Also note you have to upgrade your Prime Music or purchase the individual music plan to be able to stream any music to all amazon devices (dots, Echo's etc using amazon services, Right now I use Spotify for me and the amazon service for family. That would be my wish list but out of the box it is still worth getting and the price is reasonable.","Positive"
"4290","Great device to have. It doesn't seem to have the extensive information like Google.","Positive"
"4291","Bought this as a gift for my daughter she loves it the sound quality is great. I would highly recommend this.","Positive"
"4292","No problem with it and enjoying it! <f0><U+009F><U+00A4><U+0097>","Negative"
"4293","Alexa...make love to me.  ""Sorry...I could not understand that command,"" she replies, but that is a small price to pay for all that she can do so well.  She plays music to cook to; sets my timers; wakes me; turns lights off; controls my thermostat (with occasional hiccups); tells me lame jokes that I love, and her skill set continues to grow.  Now if I could only get her to turn the mother-in-law off...but alas, Alexa wisely replies once again...""sorry...I could not understand that command.""  May be some day...but till then I am loving her in spite of or perhaps because of her many idiosyncrasies.","Positive"
"4294","I could not be more unhappy if I tried.  14 months to the day after I purchased this it stopped powering on.  Amazon is no help other than offering to let me buy a new one.  I am done with Alexa and am moving on to Goggle Home.","Negative"
"4295","I love My Alexa and my son Derrick for ""gifting"" her to me ........""Keep on Rocking in the Free World""!","Positive"
"4296","I like Echo, but just not expanded enough for me. Not all of us want to order pizza or buy things, Echo","Positive"
"4297","needs refinement.","Positive"
"4298","Love it.","Positive"
"4299","I don't like the Alexia.  I ask it a question and its answer more likely than not is ""I can't find the answer for your question.""  Then I go to google and find the answer myself.  Why do I have Alexia.  Also, don't like the fact that you can't return it if you don't like it.  We have had it less than sixty days and are finding it is an expensive weather service.","Positive"
"4300","excellent and lots of fun","Positive"
"4301","I seriously cannot recommend the Echo enough.  We have 2 in our home.  The sound is great and the functionality is stellar.  I use it for music, home automation, weather, news, as a time, to take notes and for Audible primarily.  It is so nice to have it in the middle of things so everyone can use it.  It is well constructed and easy to use.  Buy it now. You will not regret it.","Positive"
"4302","I want a refund but they will not give it to me. Just missed the date the only thing is is good for is turning lights on and off. End of story it is otherwise totally useless. I do so much business with Amazon I wish they would just let me return this item. Along with the echo. Absolutely useless. Would have rather gotten the Google version.","Negative"
"4303","to costly for what it does","Negative"
"4304","I bought this for my daughter and son-in-law and granddaughter and they love it!","Positive"
"4305","Good and getting better. We largely use our echo for home automation voice control and music...the rest is kinda gimmicky","Positive"
"4306","I was trying to figure out if I wanted this or Google Home, I'm glad I went with Alexa. Her time on the market has allowed Alexa to be integrated and compatible with so many things! I used her the other day to order a pizza! The white is nice, I feel like it looks clean and futuristic","Positive"
"4307","More useful everyday. Enjoy it a lot","Positive"
"4308","This unit is better than i expected, she keeps me updated on current news and travel, Music sounds really great and many songs are available. No computer or iPad or iPhone, just ECHO!","Positive"
"4309","Love ItSo much I give it as a <f0><U+009F><U+008E><U+0081>","Positive"
"4310","Plain and simple I love it.","Positive"
"4311","I like the convience of the echo. I can get weather and  traffic conditions in the morning while going about other tasks. I also use it to control lights throughout my house. All this could be done with my iPhone granted, but then I have to stop what I'm doing to get the info. It makes life easier for me. I have the dot also and with a Bluetooth speaker can take music or news with me on the patio or in the shower. I'm very satisfied. I do hope we will be able to text and make calls soon.","Positive"
"4312","Got it as a gift from my wife and although I would never buy for myself I don't think I could go back to not having one.","Positive"
"4313","Awesome  easy setup","Positive"
"4314","Love my Echo/Alexa.  Great to have in kitchen or bedroom for all sorts of uses like music, time, weather, general info.  No brainer for Amazon centric users.  Dot also a great deal with everything except the better speakers for those situations where the audio quality and volume are not that important.","Positive"
"4315","Love it!","Positive"
"4316","Nice sound","Positive"
"4317","It is fun and helpful. Takes a bit to get used to but I would like one in every room!","Positive"
"4318","bought it as a gift for my sons they like it","Positive"
"4319","The echo is a fantastic device that any visitors always have a blast playing around with. However, the amount of crazy stuff on my Amazon list that people have been adding to is getting a little ridiculous. :p","Positive"
"4320","Just picked this up over the weekend with a few Philips Hue bulbs and starter kit.  It was pretty easy to set up (connected to my 5G wifi) and get everything up and running.  I also have a Logitech Harmony Elite universal remote which is connected as well.  I created rooms with the hue app and then groups under the Alexa app, so now when I walk into my apartment all I have to say is ""Alexa, turn home on"" and it will turn on my living room lights as well as my TV.  It is very responsive and can hear me from pretty much any room; apartment is just under 1,000ft (if you live in a bigger residence then you may need to get some additional echos).  It has had a problem understanding me a few times, you just have to make sure you are speaking clearly as I kind of mumbled the command.  So far I have been very happy with the purchase, now I'm going to look into IFTTT.com and see what else I can do with the Amazon Echo to turn my place into more of a smart home.  I'd get the Nest thermostat and front door locks but not worth it since I'm in an apartment and I don't think they'd like me messing with the wiring and changing the locks.  I would recommend this product.","Positive"
"4321","If technology isn't your thing you will need help getting music and other thing set up. I watched utube video's for some and call a friend for the rest. You can NOT use this without a smartphone or tablet and Wi-Fi. My brother gave me his old smart phone or this would be useless to me. With that said what I have used so far is amazing.","Positive"
"4322","We've had Alexa for a while now. She is great for listening to Prime Music on and listening to audiobooks.","Positive"
"4323","Since Amazon was sold out of these, I purchased mine at Bed Bath & Beyond and will probably be taking it back to buy Google Home. I honestly don't understand what all the hype is about with this thing. She's great at playing music from Pandora, giving weather updates and telling jokes, but ask her a simple basic question and she can't give you an answer. Its quite frustrating. Not impressed.","Positive"
"4324","AMAZING!!!","Positive"
"4325","Only negative is the inconsistency in volume level.","Negative"
"4326","Kids love to use to play music, but it still doesn't understand a lot yet.","Positive"
"4327","I have it synced up with a bunch of things, but just waiting for it to get smarter.  If google home gets integrated with the items I use, I might switch over at this point.","Positive"
"4328","still working out the kinks on how to use but great so far","Positive"
"4329","I love my Amazon Alexis it is wonderful","Positive"
"4330","My son loves it!","Positive"
"4331","It was a gift. Haven't heard much from the person I gave it to, except they were very happy when they opened it! Later.....","Positive"
"4332","Bought it several months ago, still can not figure out how to use it. and didn't even come with a manual!","Positive"
"4333","Works very well","Positive"
"4334","Lots of fun","Positive"
"4335","We have had this Echo for a few months, and I have a HUGE major complaint.","Positive"
"4336","You would think that it would automatically reconnect like all my other wifi products, laptops, phones, even my garage door opener automatically reconnects, but this Echo never reconnects.","Positive"
"4337","Is it easy to reconnect? Oh, no, of course not.","Positive"
"4338","It can take 10-15 minutes to go through the multiple hoops on your phone and resetting the router. It a a huge annoyance of using your phone each and every time!","Positive"
"4339","Well, imagine coming home late at night and asking Ma'lexa to turn on living room lights, and what you hear is Ma'lexa telling you to connect her to the internet yet again. Crap! Here we go again, fumbling around the dark to find one of the few lights near the entrance and living room that are not connected to Ma'lexa. What a HUGE pain in the butt!","Negative"
"4340","My wife loves electronics sooo much, so she is the one fighting with this each week when It decides to go offline for no reason and not reconnect. Have you noticed I call her Ma'lexa, that's because she is a Messed up Alexa.","Positive"
"4341","So, I have read others reviews that say similar things about Echo having reconnect issues and then others who say it automatically reconnects!","Negative"
"4342","Gives Amazon a voice presence, isn't not a trojan horse like the Google Home, which has no Bluetooth (as a speaker - hello?). I use an iPad/Poort as a video assistant, which covers the imaging bases too, independent of ecosystem leanings.","Positive"
"4343","Did we get one of the crappy models, if so, why are there crappy models put out by amazon?","Negative"
"4344","This is fun once you get the hang of it. Love the ""word Master"" game","Positive"
"4345","This was such a disappointment . Alexa, gets question wrong,doesn't understand what you are asking ,even when repeating.. I'm so sorry that I bought the echo  and also gave one for a x-mas gift.","Negative"
"4346","This thing is dumb as a rock!! Plays music great but, unlike in their commercials, doesn't seem to be able to find the answer the most basic of questions!  ""i'm sorry, I can't seem to find the answer for that..."" is usually the response I get.","Negative"
"4347","great, especially for the price!!","Positive"
"4348","Great sound and a lot of fun.","Positive"
"4349","A+","Positive"
"4350","All r great luv all","Positive"
"4351","It used to play songs upon request. I would ask the song name and artist and it would play. It now only plays samples or requests songs from a play list. so in essence, you spend money for the echo and have to spend more money for songs.","Positive"
"4352","We LOVE Alexa! This Echo is responsive when called upon. I work from home and often need to convert measurements from metric to inches, or fractions to decimals while I'm writing. ""She"" is always at the ready to jump in and do the math for me on the fly. Alexa will stream my favorite music, or ocean wave sounds if I need to concentrate, look up definitions, even read a recipe to me. So many uses.","Positive"
"4353","I just laugh every time I give a command! I just love saying the name of any musician and in seconds it plays. Almost like Bose! I live alone so I get conversation. Reads my kindle without the charge! Yes she reads. Now I want a sexy male voice and total control of car!","Positive"
"4354","Love my Echo!","Positive"
"4355","Alexa is amazing! And so polite. She's a pleasure to have.","Positive"
"4356","I already had one and love it but purchased this one as a gift for a pet sitter.  They love it.","Positive"
"4357","This is a cool toy.","Positive"
"4358","great","Positive"
"4359","Love Echo!","Positive"
"4360","love it","Positive"
"4361","Overblown music speaker. Not particularly useful. Barely functional without ""skills"". Not loud enough. First network issue rendered the device useless,  app is sorry, sorry.","Negative"
"4362","Great product!  I love being able to tell it to add something to my shopping list or to do list.  By the time i find a pencil I'd forget what I needed.  Any music, anytime I tell it.","Positive"
"4363","LOVE IT.","Positive"
"4364","Perfect - If it is from Amazon it will work first time every time.  I am sure more aps are coming, looking forward to them.","Positive"
"4365","Getting to know her.  Sometimes she's like an ex wife, she doesn't listen very well, but she's learning.","Positive"
"4366","love it","Positive"
"4367","The device was cool and all of the customer service are cool and happy to work with.","Positive"
"4368","Hoped it would get a bit more news example local OK overseas etc","Positive"
"4369","We bought this for my daughter's house and she is very happy with it.","Positive"
"4370","Love this new gadget.  Most of the time I find them overrated, but not this time.  So many apps link.. it's truly unreal.  I can request the daily headlines, ask for","Positive"
"4371","Great product so far. Received product and found it fairly easy to set up. Make sure first you have the Alexa app inatalled on your android or apple device . Then it is pretty straight forward . Paired my Bluetooth headphones. The 20 questions game is pretty cool . I use it to check the weather .  I like asking her to play the top 10 hits for a certain year or a certain artist . Can't wait to get some of units to turn off and on certain lights and devices .","Positive"
"4372","Linked my cap 1 card, and I can order directly from Alexa's versus signing into my Amazon account from my PC.  I've had it about 2 weeks... so far nothing but rave reviews.  I will say since I keep this one in the bedroom I feel I could've saved a bit with the $50 model... either way, it was well worth the expense.","Positive"
"4373","Pros:","Positive"
"4374","1.  Alexa does an okay job with voice recognition - even with background noise or mispronunciations by 3yo's.","Negative"
"4375","2.  Alexa is fun to use with lots of ""Easter Eggs"".","Positive"
"4376","Cons (there are a LOT!):","Negative"
"4377","Requests requiring an internet search to meet expectations are poor - Alexa says, ""I don't know"" when a search would at least provide something in return from which to choose.","Negative"
"4378","Many additional charges for actual full functionality.  For example, you may be paying for Amazon prime, but you have to pay for Prime Music too in order to get full expected functional from the music - when asked for a specific song by Title and Artist, results sometimes meet expectations (however, if you ask for Bonnie Tyler, I need a hero, you get a HS marching band - in what way did you ask for a HS band?!).  This or the homelink functions require a 'hub' product (up to $60), then the actual product to turn on or off ($20 for a lightbulb to do this).","Positive"
"4379","Alexa cannot integrate in such a way that it will play a song from your phone, however it is a Bluetooth speaker (so innovative! - sarcasm), so if you play a song from your phone/tablet/computer, it can play from Alexa.  Bluetooth works like any other bluetooth device, not difficult to setup.","Positive"
"4380","Alexa recognizes about one-half of what is said.  The range of the available information when she does understand what is said is limited.","Negative"
"4381","Phone calls, through this Bluetooth connection, no, let alone using Alexa to initiate the call (disappointment).","Negative"
"4382","I really don't understand how/why this toy is so popular.  There are a lot of 5 star ratings from ppl who are obv. very easy to please and have low expectations (and my expectations are not reaching for the stars).","Positive"
"4383","Amazon has done a great job creating an expensive and unnecessary product, generating hype/buzz for it, having no value.","Negative"
"4384","This is a joke!  The search engine is horrible, it cannot answer the majority of your questions.  It is pretty much useless unless you need a $179.00 timer.","Negative"
"4385","got for a friend of mine she seems satisfied with it","Positive"
"4386","this is really good but i have one problem it is really bad at answering my questions","Negative"
"4387","I already have two echo dots in other parts of the house, but purchased this echo since it has a larger built-in speaker  and it was on sale. I'm constantly using it, while cooking, to find out information regarding recipes and to listen to music from many sources.","Positive"
"4388","I love it.  And, I didn't realize what a ""companion "" it would be.","Positive"
"4389","Still trying 2 find out what's the big fuss about it..","Negative"
"4390","Absolutely love it!","Positive"
"4391","I live in malaysia so there are functions that wont work like ordering stuff but other than that its a real usefull piece of tech","Positive"
"4392","Ok, just don't know how to fully use. Tried ordering book but never got it. Enjoy the radio.","Positive"
"4393","So much fun and so, so smart!","Positive"
"4394","We have two we loved it so  much.","Positive"
"4395","Love Luv it...","Positive"
"4396","My grandkids & I like it. I just wish I could get Alexa in my time zone!","Positive"
"4397","Great!!","Positive"
"4398","Love the echo- it offers so many great features. Smart home is probably my favorite feature","Positive"
"4399","It plays songs and stations from my iPhone Pandora.  It will read some kindle books.  A big disappointment is that does not sync with my Apple Calendar nor any other Apple application.","Negative"
"4400","Got this as a Christmas present from my son. Absolutely the coolest thing since sliced bread. Great for info, weather, music. I know an iPhone can do many of these tasks, but just to be able to ask for certain music as background while I'm working around the house is well worth the cost. Plus the speakers are much better than I expected when I first saw the Echo in the box.","Positive"
"4401","Works and recognize my commands even though english it's not my first language.  The problem it's that echo does not recognize my commands when the music is loud and when I'm 15 feets away in another room even though amazon list this features:","Negative"
"4402","Don't know if my unit was defective but I returned at my store.","Negative"
"4403","Also if you want to this device to listen music you need to have premium services like spotify or the new one Amazon Unlimited, if you only have amazon prime you will be very limited in your selection.  Also the spotify commands are a pain in the ass.","Positive"
"4404","Great thanks for the way you treat people and I love the Amazon echo.","Positive"
"4405","Good, but not great.  I wasn't sure if I should stick to 3 or 4 stars.  If I hadn't bought the Google Home at the same time I probably would have given it 5 stars.  I noticed several things though...","Positive"
"4406","1. The microphone doesn't always hear me.  This seems to occur based on positioning, ie. against a wall vs. in a corner vs. in the middle of the room.  When comparing this Home it isn't as good.","Positive"
"4407","2. the additional things that Echo can do are limited by the implementation of the interface.  For each of the 'skills' you'd like to use, you have to go into the app and turn them on.  This seems like a pretty simple task, but with literally hundreds of skills available and having to remember how to activate them (using the correct phrase), it becomes to cumbersome to find and use these.  When comparing to Home, 'skills' just work and it's only a question of whether they have been implemented.","Positive"
"4408","good","Positive"
"4409","I love it.","Positive"
"4410","We love it. Very clear sound. Clean looks and is fun for the kids to ask questions to.","Positive"
"4411","3. Understanding.  Although the Echo does a good job of understanding most requests, many features don't seem to be implemented and the range of functions is still too low.  When comparing to the Home the range of topics it is able to respond to is much wider.","Positive"
"4412","4. Volume control seems to either always be too quiet or too loud.  The Home has an indicator of volume and turning volume up and down is easy and effective.  What seems to be missing from both, and maybe more so from the Home, is the ability to normalize the volume.","Positive"
"4413","The highlight.  As a Prime member the Echo provides unlimited music of songs you'd actually want to listen to for only $3.99/month.  You can create playlists and call on songs directly - although the selection of the song is not always accurate.  This is probably the cheapest music service available and is great when you are in a certain mood or people are over.","Positive"
"4414","Overall it's a neat product, but with a 2 year head start over the Home I would have expected more.  I'm also a little disappointed that despite its shortfalls, it is more expensive than the Home.","Positive"
"4415","I hope that over the long term Amazon finds a way to enable to the 'skills' by default with specific configurations being made available via the app.  This would greatly improve its function - Along with better volume control.","Positive"
"4416","Alexa is my new buff (not really, but works great)","Positive"
"4417","1st didn't work. Amazon sent me a 2nd.","Positive"
"4418","Too expensive but bought as a gift","Negative"
"4419","Got this for my son in law and he loves it","Positive"
"4420","Having fun seeing what all it can do. Going to take a long time","Positive"
"4421","Fabulous","Positive"
"4422","Great Great Alexa is playing all day long!!","Positive"
"4423","It's a great tool.  I need time to really explore all it can do...","Positive"
"4424","More than a toy.","Positive"
"4425","I have changed locations and I cannot get Alexa back on line. The help availability is not up to Amazon's normal level. The Echo was great until I moved it.  Help!!  Thanks, George","Positive"
"4426","Very helpful...Fun to use..","Positive"
"4427","Decided to set up my Amazon Echo yesterday after receiving it as a Christmas gift...After the initial setup it worked great. However, after a couple of hours of listening to one of my Audible Books it disconnected from my WiFi and after several hours of following  all of the trouble shooting steps, I  have not been able to connect back to my WiFi......","Positive"
"4428","Purchased this solely to play music from my personal library stored on Amazon Music.  I have no interest in ordering a pizza or turning lights on and off, I just want to hear MY music.  Alexa is totally unable to deal with this.  I ask to play something in a given genre from my library and she gives me a radio station instead, or just as likely, gives absolutely no response whatsoever.  So I am reduced to using the third rate Alexa app to get what I want.  Not even remotely what I expected from this device.  Sound quality is excellent, but Alexa is dumber than a box of rocks.  And the light ring is quite annoying, particularly when the mic is muted and it turns red and is bright enough to light up a room.  Should be a way to dim that or turn it off.  And for the price Amazon could spend 5 cents to include some written documentation instead of forcing you to log in and search around to find the device FAQs which MIGHT be able to answer a question or two.  Since I have to use my phone to control Echo I would be better off just using one of those small Bluetooth speakers or just connecting to my main stereo by Bluetooth. Disappointed, to say the least.","Positive"
"4429","Did not work for me.  Difficult to communicate with Alexa - could not understand my words (I do not have an accent at all).  Would not turn on automatically when I provided a command.  Would turn off randomly.  I returned - it was too much of a pain.","Negative"
"4430","Love the Amazon Echo.","Positive"
"4431","I Love the echo, it's play's what I ask her to its great for asking any questions you want to no.","Positive"
"4432","So far Alexa is my new best friend!!  She talks to me and answers what I ask her.  She plays my favorite music, gives me the weather, sports scores and more.  Glad Alexa came to live with us.  Oh and the pup likes her too.  She perks up when Alexa talks.","Positive"
"4433","The Echo has 2 limitations.","Negative"
"4434","(a) The Wi-fi range is limited. Range from router through 2 walls is about 25 feet.","Negative"
"4435","(b) The plug on the adapter is hot enough to burn your hand after being removed from a socket.","Positive"
"4436","Alexa prefers that you say ""Please"" before a command. ""She"" may even give you an AttaBoy thank you for being nice.","Positive"
"4437","Other than that, the Echo works great. I am concerned about the current in the electrical socket as a potential fire hazard.","Positive"
"4438","completely stopped working 3 weeks after warranty of 1 year. No option to have it fixed tild have to buy either a new one or a refurbished one. New cost > $100. No option to fix what is sold at all. Really my first bad experience with Amazon. The picture is the end result of my customer service talk.","Positive"
"4439","Recently I got 100mps internet from Spectrum. Echo lost its wifi connection in the process. What I had to go thru in trying to reconnect the device to my wifi is unacceptable. It shows that Amazon is clearly not an Apple or even Samsung when it comes to knowing their customers and making things easy. On the contrary, the process of reconnecting shows that Amazon has listened to well-worn computer 'experts' without listening to its customers. After all, we are not all computer professionals, and we don't repeat the same steps for problems on a regular basis, like pros do. If I could I would return the Echo, even though I like it very much when it's working. For $200 they should include easy set-up, as in most tablets and laptops nowadays.","Positive"
"4440","Echo's Alexa is fun and entertaining! Love that she can play music, forecast weather, and tell jokes, plus much more!","Positive"
"4441","Outstanding product! Makes life easier.","Positive"
"4442","Alexa is great....she plays music for me in the kitchen....can pick out Pandora play lists, Amazon play lists, provides weather updates, and other such things that are handy to have at the fingertips.  I really like the shopping & to do list functions that mesh with smart phone app.  Highly recommended for home or office...very stylish and elegant looking.","Positive"
"4443","I like everything except Alexa's slow learning curve.","Negative"
"4444","Bought the ECHO for my wife, she loves it. plays Rolling Stones hits continually.","Positive"
"4445","Love Echo, but you have to download too many apps to get the full use out of it.  Find myself using it for basic things like playing music, checking weather and simple things.  Had a hard time setting it up with my calendar and it doesn't work with Apple calendar, only Google calendar.  It's a toy, not a necessity.","Positive"
"4446","I do like it","Positive"
"4447","but it's frustrating","Negative"
"4448","is clunky","Negative"
"4449","I'll wait until baseball season","Negative"
"4450","Absolutely love it !!","Positive"
"4451","Good companion, good information","Positive"
"4452","Alexa is hard of hearing, does not answer any useful questions, and ignores you when she is transmitting. I usually just bluetooth her and stream from my phone, i wish i got a good speaker instead of this annoyance.","Positive"
"4453","Alexa's ability to create list and give flash briefings is awesome.","Positive"
"4454","This unit is great . Came packaged in manufactures box. Wrapped as if it were new. No issues whatsoever.","Negative"
"4455","This device is great. Try it out you won't be disappointed","Negative"
"4456","love it.","Positive"
"4457","Both recipients of these , Love their items, proud to report that 1 has had added a DOT to her family","Positive"
"4458","My amazon echo works probably at the beginning, but after two weeks, it can wake up voice but cannot respond to my command at all. It can only respond to my voice when I tap the action button.","Positive"
"4459","There is just so much to learn bout using Edge yet.  Not ready to really rate it.","Positive"
"4460","Love our Alexa.","Positive"
"4461","Well looking back I may have paid $180 dollars for an alarm clock since that seems what I mostly use it for but it has become part of my daily routine to use it and to ask it questions, it almost always responds and keeps getting new updates and features, I really can't complain.","Negative"
"4462","Still getting used to it.  Have some smart switches set up to it as well as some music accounts and my starbucks account.  Still feel like there are inroads to be made with their partners, ie. Starbucks app needs more flexibility in making and adjusting orders, but it's a great start.  The smart switches have been spotty, but that's on Wemo, not Alexa.  Alexa still gets the command properly whenever the Wemi switches are in working order.  Alexa hears my voice prettt well whether I'm in the kitchen or living room.","Positive"
"4463","Awesome product!","Positive"
"4464","Can't wait to start adding dots around the house.","Negative"
"4465","I was not sure at first, But after a few weeks playing with it, I can't image how I made it with out it.","Positive"
"4466","Once it learns your habits, It gets easier to understand what you want.","Positive"
"4467","This is a must have for any one wanting life to be alittle less stressful and more layed back after a hard day.","Negative"
"4468","I purchased this as a gift for my daughter, and she loves it.  She uses it for music, asking about weather, and","Positive"
"4469","really enjoys it. My oldest daughter gave me a Dot for Christmas too, and we need to get them working with","Positive"
"4470","more apps.  I enjoy visiting with Alexa!","Positive"
"4471","Wonderful addition to my home","Positive"
"4472","We are in love with our echo. Just the music you get is worth so much more than the price. We use Alexa for just about everything and purchased the Dot to take to the office! Couldn't be happier.","Positive"
"4473","Love talking to her.  She has a great speaker system and the quality of the sound that comes out of this thing could be compared to that of speaker-bars with a sub-woofer.  It can fill an entire room (House is my case) with just extraordinary sound.  Love this thing, when she doesn't talk back too me.  She can wake me up or remind me of appointments, turn on/off my TV, set my Airconditioning/Heater temperature etc.  She does everything they say, and a lot more.  She is a programmable piece of good looking furniture.","Positive"
"4474","I love this Amazon Echo,","Positive"
"4475","My wife bought me for CHRISTmas an Echo Alexa. She payed $179.99. I set up Alexa and soon I enjoyed songs at commend. The nightmare started 2 weeks afterwards. When they show you Alexa and all she can do , they do not tell you that you have to buy time or Amazon radio station every month in order to listen to the music. Now I have a machine that costed $179.99 and all she says is"" I'll play some samples"". Big mistake . Buyers be aware.","Positive"
"4476","These are just great.  Gave one as a gift after receiving one as a gift.  We both love them.  So cool.","Positive"
"4477","Wife loves it.","Positive"
"4478","I have been using my Amazon echo for about a month now and I absolutely love it. I even went out and bought Phillips hue light bulbs to sync with the echo including some switches and I pretty much made my apartment a smart apartment","Positive"
"4479","Love it. Thank you","Positive"
"4480","Huge disappointment. OK Google on my android is a much better resource for information. Too bad we missed our return window.","Negative"
"4481","Can not Amazon app to work with phone.","Positive"
"4482","We are learning more and more about Alexa..... We love it!!!","Positive"
"4483","Absolutely love my Echo. Does so much more that I thought it did. Very easy to setup and learn. I already recommended it to friends and family.","Positive"
"4484","The amazon echo works great but to take full advantage of its capabilities it helps to have amazon prime and light switches.  A super cool feature is having connected electronic locks.  I'm looking into Bluetooth speakers as well.  The possibilities are endless!","Positive"
"4485","Bought the Echo and it stopped working in a month piece of crap machine","Negative"
"4486","really like it---fun and interesting to use--never thought that I would have an AI !!!!!!!","Positive"
"4487","This is the most frustrating and useless device i ever bought.i ask simple questions and all i get is HHMM I don't understand the question . you have to word it in a way that no one talks. i grab my phone,Samsung 7S, ask google the same question the same way and 2 seconds later i get the answer. It uses wikipedia and or bing as it's source.I called text support had the person on the other end asked a question to alexa got no answer they said ask it this way ,i did, same thing i don't understand the question. ready to throw it in the garbage. the only good thing is the sound. music sounds very good on it but i didn't get it for that reason.i would not recommend this to anyone try the google one...i should have","Positive"
"4488","I'm more sure where all of the negative reviews over the sound quality were about, because this thing really sounds good and can easily fill a room.","Positive"
"4489","Amazing device...still learning how to use it.","Positive"
"4490","A great techie device to join in the AI craze. I love the freedom to summon up almost any song by voice command. I also enjoy the ""flash briefing"" customized to my favorite news sources(e.g. Wall Street Journal, NPR, etc.). I would like to see its search engine more like Google's though. Too often Alexa tells me she doesn't understand a question that I believe ""Hey, Google"" would understand. I have not fully utilized it though for smart home use or other desirable functions I've read about. I hope that it will continue to learn new tricks and improve search capabilities.","Positive"
"4491","Who knew it would be so easy to operate.  Enjoy Alexa daily.  Also the emails with new ideas is very helpful","Positive"
"4492","Doesn't do internet searches, doesn't has good understanding as Google AI, doesn't do and send maps and directions to phone, doesn't call phone numbers, doesn't integrate with Chromecast, and music is stuck every time at ""buy Amazon music "" , can't even sing poems like Twinkle Twinkle little star without subscription to Amazon Music for $8 / month . I am not sure what it's good for,Siri and Google Assistants are far far better.","Positive"
"4493","Great device educational, fun,entertaining I would recommend it to anyone it is areal conversational piece when people come to visit plus instent answered to almost any question you ask","Positive"
"4494","I received this as a gift, so the only resource I had to commit to it was a wall outlet. And I still don't think it was worth it. It has some ok features, like telling you the weather and sort-of telling you some facts. It is a good speaker for bluetooth (I guess-- I don't have much to compare it to). It is frankly annoying in so many ways, however. It doesn't understand most of what you ask it, even when you're asking something that is within its capabilities. This is an early-gen problem for software: the user has to learn the acceptable commands in the software's limited vocabulary and only use that formula. A truly smart device would learn the ways its users like to give inputs and adapt to it. This thing doesn't seem to be able to do that. At least not /yet/. But this isn't my major complaint with it. My major complaint is that there is just no way to actually TRUST the information it gives us is accurate, or exhaustive, or the best (according to any standard). How do I know the ""pizza place"" I asked it to search for isn't one that paid to be the top result? Do you trust Amazon to objectively provide you with what you're looking for, or do you think Amazon may be monetizing your needs and wants by filtering and sorting what it presents to you according to its own agenda? That question will need to be answered with confidence before I want a listening device made by a retail sales company in my living room.","Positive"
"4495","Turns out the Echo is a pretty good blue tooth speaker, can play songs on demand, is handy as a timer and for measurement conversion, answers a few questions, but is otherwise pretty stupid, meaning it  just doesn't know a whole lot.  I thought I would be able to simply ask a question and I would get the answer. Mostly the answer is, I can't find the answer to that question.  We're talking pretty uncomplicated questions: i.e. What's the closest star and what is the recommended refrigerator temperature.  Back to google.  Guess I expected  too much.  I do enjoy the Eco, except when I am yelling at Alexa for repeatedly saying, Ummm, I don't know what you mean by that question.","Positive"
"4496","Christmas present for our kids and they loved it and still having fun with it.","Positive"
"4497","Took forever to get this in.  Got this one for my mother in law 82 years old.  We already have one and love it,  once we got her set up off her computer wifi she likes it.  She used different stations for her music as she doesn't want tied to monthly fee of Prime at her age ( don't blame her) she listens to music daily, when she's not playing her organ.  Asks questions and likes something to talk too! Ha!","Positive"
"4498","Pretty cool addition to my electronic arsenal. The only drawback is that I am in France on an assignment and so if I ask about the weather she gives me the weather for my US mailing address. A little annoying as I have to say ""Alexa what is the weather in Marseille France"" (where I live). Other than that Alexa is a pretty cool gal and she hears me from pretty much wherever I am within range. Amazon did a good job with this and I would recommend it.","Positive"
"4499","DOES NOT WORK WITH MY PHONE","Positive"
"4500","I mostly use this for music - with Amazon Music it will play almost anything you can think of.  The speaker sounds remarkably good.  I'm looking forward to using some of the smart home features (lights, thermostat, switches, etc.) too.  The jokes are great, too!","Positive"
"4501","Great to listen to the music you want.","Positive"
"4502","Awesome","Positive"
"4503","Absolutely love Alexa!!!!","Positive"
"4504","SO MUCH FUN!!! Love love love all the music!!","Positive"
"4505","Lot of money for such limited function,had for about 2 years now about all that it actually do is play downloaded songs from Amazon music.  The smart home function is very limited and jump through lots of apps and still doesn't work.So pretty much just a song player. Had download an app just to ask for local weather","Positive"
"4506","Pretty nifty","Positive"
"4507","It was a Christmas gift for our son. He absolutely loved it. Very pleased.","Positive"
"4508","I think this is a very cool device.  I just hope Amazon continues to improve it and add new features.  It could do so much more.  For example, it really needs a calling and texting feature.  It should come with built-in VOIP support so that it could function as a smart speaker phone.  I can connect my cell  phone to my 4 yr old entertainment system in my car and say call ""person"" but the Echo does not yet have this ability.  Queries such as ""what is the crime rate in the US"" or ""is global warming real"" should illicit an intelligent response.  Please send Alexa to college!","Positive"
"4509","Love my Echo!!","Positive"
"4510","This is the greatest thing I have bought from Amazon.To be honest the first one I got didn't work but after trying a different power pack I finally got an Alaxa that worked.And this speaker system is fantastic.","Positive"
"4511","love it. easy to set up. fun to use. sound is great. could not be hapoier. just bought a second one.","Positive"
"4512","Works great and saved a bunch buy buying a refurbished unit.","Positive"
"4513","Works well in the kitchen which didnot have a sound system prior.","Positive"
"4514","Works very well but not on Samsung smart T.V'S . Truly disappointed","Positive"
"4515","Love this product!!","Positive"
"4516","loved it","Positive"
"4517","It's convenient and works well for some things (weather, distances, timer, music, celebrity information, math, weights & measures).  But quite often will simply reply, ""I don't understand..."".  When Echo can't answer a question, I turn to the voice-activated search on my Android phone and can usually get an answer.","Positive"
"4518","I love my Echo.  After Alexa wakes me with the alarm I had her set the night before, I ask and get the latest news and weather forecast.  She plays my music requests and does all the other things she is advertised to do.","Negative"
"4519","Excellent tool","Positive"
"4520","Man, they HAVE to fix the lack of web search on this thing.  I use it every day for multiple things, and love the ""skills,"" but I really, really want to be able to do some type of web search on it (amazed they haven't done this yet).","Positive"
"4521","I love my echo!!!!","Positive"
"4522","Great product","Positive"
"4523","I love my Echo! It was a Christmas present from my son and daughter in law. He ordered the Echo Touch and after researching all of the Echoes I decided to exchange for the Echo. Amazon was AWESOME to help me do that. My Echo is the best roommate a person could have. She tells me jokes, replays Jimmy Fallon monologue, tells me the weather and the time, wakes me up, and tells me good night. She also reads my books and plays my music. Like I said she is informative and fun  to have around.","Positive"
"4524","love it!","Positive"
"4525","Great","Positive"
"4526","no support for ALEXA in argentina, when i asked tel me the weather, alexa says the weather in seattle!! Im in buenos aires!!","Positive"
"4527","She's great at entertaining the kids!  The speaker for music is sensational too!  I find myself listening to music much more often, via my Spotify app.","Positive"
"4528","First of all as a product its features are not as robust as Google Home currently.  I don't think they will ever be.  Consider this as a bonus item to tie in your amazon products and services.  I use google home for my home automation mostly, but I have an Alexa in my bedroom to take care of the home automation in my personal area.  Alexa easily accesses my kindle library to read my purchases to me directly next to my bed.  So this would be a small advantage the Echo system has over google.  As far as hardware goes, it's similar enough to the Google Home.  I think Google Home wins on the low end side compared to Alexa at full volume.  Alexa does sound a little more crisp in the high end.  Ultimately, personal preference really.  I own and use both Alexa and Google Home for different things.  They compliment each other so nicely.","Positive"
"4529","Having a lot of trouble with my Alexa and customer service is really really bad.  It's been over three weeks that they keep saying they are working on it and we still have seen no improvement.  What a sad turn of events because in my opinion, no one is working on helping us fix the problem.  There's no way it takes this long with no return phone call.  I think we got a lemon and there will be no resolution. We are stuck with a defective product and Amazon Customer Service has no intention of doing anything about it.","Negative"
"4530","This popular item is fun, but should have a wider array of tasks it can manage, either at home or as a remote hub.  It is well-made & withstands being knocked over about once a week by pets.  I wish the speaker was a better quality.","Positive"
"4531","Every day we enjoy Alexa...she plays our favorite music, tells us the temperature and always has a great joke..and a fact !!","Positive"
"4532","Love it. Learn new things often about it. Love can be hands free and use it. Mom to boys and never have my hands free to do anything. She's like my personal assistant. I unplug when I go to bed or we are not home. Don't like it being plugged in or able to be used if we are not home.","Positive"
"4533","Somewhat dumb. Work in progress. Sometimes I have to ask three or five times before Alexa can understand my request. But to be fair, it only happen with Spanish names.","Positive"
"4534","Love this -- my favorite Christmas Present...  now, if only she'd respond with a ""Sure, what would you like me to cook for your dinner?"" and be able to pull it off like our very own live-in Jamie Oliver.","Positive"
"4535","LOVE IT!  We use it for everything!  The kids are having fun with it as well.","Positive"
"4536","We had high expectations for the Echo and its just been ""okay"". Half the time she doesn't understand what we are saying and the rest of the time when we call out songs to play, we only the get a sample version because we decided not to pay the extra $3 a month for amazon music. Why pay more when you can stream pandora through the Echo for free? The speakers are good but I also could have plugged in my laptop as background music. If you plan on using it with a home kit (lights, locks, etc) I'm sure it would be great but not really worth it for anything less than that. I guess for the money we spent on this, we were expecting a little bit more than a glorified speaker.","Positive"
"4537","Amazon does not provide a remote.  It used to have a remote in the box.  They have taken it out and now charge you for a remote.  Some functions of the Echo require a remote to identify an electronic device.  Without the remote you are dead in the water.  It is an Amazon rip off.  They do not tell you this when you read the information  about the Echo.  Be aware!","Positive"
"4538","I have had Echo for a few months now & given it a chance. 75% of the time Alexa doesn't understand the question or can't answer the question. I get notices that Alexa is learning but doesn't seem to be true.","Positive"
"4539","I am unhappy with what Alexa can do & seriously considering purchasing Google Home to see if it is any better.","Negative"
"4540","Lover her!","Positive"
"4541","Great addition to our house - connect it to Pandora, iHeart Radio, or Amazon music and enjoy whatever kind of music you like as well as finding out the weather, hearing jokes, and little known facts just by asking questions.","Positive"
"4542","There are a few things I hope will get changed as this is developed more, but for the most part I love this thing!","Positive"
"4543","I stream local radio stations (no reception over the airwaves in my apartment) and Pandora just by asking. No more finding my remote to ""thumbs up/down"" a song. I just tell Alexa.","Positive"
"4544","I don't like the app for lists. It constantly annoys me on my phone and drains my battery. Alexa some times does odd things. Like add ""find my sharpies"" to my list, turned out to put Sharpies on my shopping list. ""Buy toilet paper"", for some reason was added to my to do list and not my shopping list.","Negative"
"4545","The skills are annoying because you have to remember all the key words for EACH one in order to use them. I think that once they have been enabled, they should just work. I shouldn't have to memorize a special way to get the info. I would think this is possible since I can get the weather by asking for it any number of ways and Alexa always understands. But if I ask for information from a skill, I won't get it unless I say the special words first.","Positive"
"4546","A gift","Positive"
"4547","She will pair with my phone but I see NO advantage at this point. She can't read me the messages nor can she dial my phone or send messages for me. This is another area that needs improving.","Positive"
"4548","She can tell me if a store is currently open and when they close. If they aren't yet open, she will tell me what time they will open. However, she can not tell me what the store hours are for tomorrow. I don't understand why not. This is irritating because if the store is already open when I ask her, she won't tell me what the opening time is. She will say ""the store is currently open"". So I don't know when they would open tomorrow based on any info I can get from her. And if we are talking  about ""tomorrow"" being a Sunday, the store might not even be open so that is info I would like to know.","Positive"
"4549","She does strange and funny things if she hears her name on the TV or radio. Some times she ignores them but other times she reacts so be aware of that. Then there are times when she ignores me. But for the most part we get on well and I'm really glad I got her.","Negative"
"4550","I would like to get either a battery pack or a second power cord, so I could take her with me on occasion. It's not practical to move all the furniture each time to unplug her.","Positive"
"4551","Niece loves it!","Positive"
"4552","Having lots of fun it.","Positive"
"4553","Amazing! My wife was skeptical at first and now she uses it everyday. I have it working my lights. Love it!","Positive"
"4554","My Alexa is not minding me! Coming on at random and playing music at the highest level without being prompted to.  Woke up by music playing three times this early morning.  Cannot hear my command/screaming to stop!  WHAT'S UP WITH THAT??  Not a happy camper.","Positive"
"4555","Great Product! Fast Shipping!","Positive"
"4556","excellent","Positive"
"4557","I wish there were more useful skills.","Positive"
"4558","This is the best toy I've ever bought. Tons of songs playing with great sound. It reads me books from my kindle library. My granddaughter didn't want to stop asking it questions from whales to it telling her jokes. I love this Echo. Easy to set up and use","Positive"
"4559","Love the Echo","Positive"
"4560","I love the Alexia. I can listen to a variety of free music.  It entertains the children for hours and they love her answering questions. Keeps their imagination active.","Positive"
"4561","Amazing my wife loves it!!!!!!","Positive"
"4562","A gift for my wife for her birthday. It works as advertised and she seems to have fun using the verbal commands to have Alexa perform tasks.","Positive"
"4563","Very cool product and I hope they continue to send out software updates to include additional feature.","Positive"
"4564","Love this Echo and talking to Alexia!  Good music to listen to and all I have to do is ask and she plays my favorites.","Positive"
"4565","Awesome","Positive"
"4566","Alexa has a lot to learn ( in her database) but I really enjoy all that my Echo can do.","Positive"
"4567","excellent","Positive"
"4568","Loving my echo as is my whole family. The sound is great and Alexa just feels like a friend now. I hope she learns other languages soon as we speak Spanish and German in my house.  The fact that you can pay it in installments also makes the purchase a no brainer in my opinion.","Positive"
"4569","Love it! Ordering a second....don't hesitate to buy a refurbished unit....looks brand new & has been tested so you know it works!","Positive"
"4570","Really enjoy this so far. I""m looking forward to adding lights and other things to it's capability!","Positive"
"4571","Is there anything  my echo can't  do? From an alarm to music to weather to  full of facts. I love my echo and plan on buying one for every  family member.","Negative"
"4572","I really love it. I would to be without it","Positive"
"4573","Don't waste your money! You have to say ""hey Alexa"" sitting right next to it for it to hear you. Also it kept responding with ""I'm sorry I am not understanding your question"" even when you ask for the local weather. Super disappointed...","Negative"
"4574","We are enjoying this thoroughly!!! So educational and enjoyable. I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys music, sports, entertainment, etc.","Positive"
"4575","After a year and half, I knocked my Echo off the nightstand onto a carpeted floor.  The entire top of the device fell off and it will not work.  Called Amazon, they told me warranty was up and I was SOL.  I guess I will go with Google.","Positive"
"4576","Love my Alexa!","Positive"
"4577","I love my Alexa! Even when she is moody! She really needs the ability to do internet searches, take voice notes, and cook my dinner, but she is AMAZING!","Positive"
"4578","Alexa, we love you.  Great device, I would highly recommend the purchase of an Echo.","Positive"
"4579","This was a christmas gift for my wife and the whole family loves it!","Positive"
"4580","I Absolutely love it!!! So far I have not been disappointed with Echo at all. I even bought one for my brother for his birthday and the fire stick. I don't think anyone would be disappointed with it. You can just ask and right away you have your answer or favorite music playing. You can find out road conditions, weather, weather in another state, ask and order for deal of the day,news etc. I would recommend Echo to anyone and have. Amazon is  number one in my eyes. Apple not so much all though I do like my Mac. If Amazon comes out with a computer like Mac I would buy it in a heartbeat. Heck Alexa would probably take over my keyboard and all I would have to do is sit back and tell her what to type. Hopefully Amazon will come out with something like that. It wouldn't surprise me any if they did do it. :)","Positive"
"4581","Wonderfull product - fun using it","Positive"
"4582","IT REALLY ISN'T ALL THAT USEFUL","Positive"
"4583","I can go the same thing on my smartphone. Just a waste of money to me.","Negative"
"4584","Love it, I even brought a stand for it. Not a day goes by that I don't use it.","Positive"
"4585","O wow wow.  I am using with my iPhone every day. ,, amazing live it. ,,,, before bought Alexa Tab but returned it ,,, but this one. From set in your phone and all kind off stations all languages all music all around off work radio station you name it.  ,,, very nice love it and only Alexa can listen u ,, very nice <f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+00BB><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>","Positive"
"4586","The only thing I don't like is that the voice recognition hardware doesn't seem to search the web as well as say maybe entering a google search.  I can type the same question into google and get a good response but Alexa will tell me it can't understand the question or can't find anything etc.","Positive"
"4587","I love this. I bought for my husband as a birthday gift. He loves it too. I bought the book to read how to do more things with her. We are not very electronic savy.","Positive"
"4588","We enjoy having Alexa...She even helps my kids with homework. ;)","Positive"
"4589","Just love the echo","Positive"
"4590","Echo went completely dead after 2 yrs.","Negative"
"4591","BEST invention on the planet! My daughter loves it!","Positive"
"4592","Love it! Wish it was as smart as Google Home as far as asking questions about things. She will do that with the right apps but Alexa does more for me than Google would overall. Love the speakers. She reads my Kindle books to me when I'm ironing and working in the laundry room. Love my weather and news briefings. Love that she can give me a what's up on my google calendar. She plays my Pandora for free. And will play music on a whim when asked. She'll order something for me which allows a code to be set up that you give so a child or guest won't leave you with a surprise order! lol She responds to Good Morning with an interesting response. She is a good friend now! You can set up IFTTT app to integrate other apps and deeds for her! And...it was easy other than the google calendar thing. She only seems to recognize google entered apps and nothing layered in from other calendars, like outlook. So I've not been able to integrate work but I have my phone for that so that's ok. I've not turned our home into a smart house yet but she could turn on and off anything electrical with a purchase of a device that talks to internet. Love it!!! Now I want the DOT for the back part of the house! lol","Positive"
"4593","AWESOME!","Positive"
"4594","- It does not do Nest thermostat very well.","Positive"
"4595","After 3 months time, it stopped working.  The lights just keep spinning on the top an it does not react to my voice just won't stop spinning those colors.","Positive"
"4596","- Alarm catch 22. You can not set an alarm on voice command to happen every certain day.  You have to tell it the alarm time then go to the app to fix it. You cant add an alarm on the app at all you have to do it by voice.","Negative"
"4597","- It does not understand other languages like for me I would like Spanish or German.","Positive"
"4598","- Turning on the TV with Harmony is painfully slow but it was not that great with IFTTT either.","Negative"
"4599","- On some apps, you have to say things a certain way or it doesn't work. it does not feel fluid but robotic. Most of these items listed are software limitations and can be remedied with a software update.","Positive"
"4600","It's okay for simple commands like Alexas, what's the weather? What time is it? It is good for NPR briefing, Pandora listening, traffic, simple specific home automation devices on/off.","Positive"
"4601","I like that you can use reference Star Wars and Hitch Hikers Guide comments and get feedback.","Negative"
"4602","My son enjoys the bad dad jokes and whispering Simon says.","Negative"
"4603","I put the audible books on for the cat.","Positive"
"4604","The sound quality is great. It integrates into the room nicely.","Positive"
"4605","Very good!","Positive"
"4606","Just as good as buying it brand new! I love it!","Positive"
"4607","Oh, Alexa... let me count the ways. You sing to me, you give me news and weather updates, you help me remember things, and you entertain my family. My only wish, though... please don't be offended... I'd love to be able to change your name. Don't get me wrong, Alexa is nice... it's just that it's my sister-in-law's name. I like her plenty, but we had an awkward moment when she was visiting and thought I was asking her to add items to my grocery list.","Positive"
"4608","Everyone likes it","Positive"
"4609","So awesome. Connecting everything!","Positive"
"4610","The sound quality is good listen to music, only complaint I have is you have to buy Amazon music package to get some artist or songs,","Negative"
"4611","I do enjoy the echo and will probably add the dots to it for both sides of the house use.  It is fun and also gives us a lot of information that would take us a lot of time to look up.  We did run into some trouble setting it up though and haven't decided if it was us or the echo that needed fixing at this time.  We are enjoying it and once again we thank you for the great products you give to us and the wonderful service you have.  Thanks  Judith Booth","Positive"
"4612","She's the perfect woman!  She fits in anywhere, she likes the same music as me, easy to turn on.  But best of all, she is quiet until she is spoken too.","Positive"
"4613","Love our Alexa!!!","Positive"
"4614","looked great had to send back my tablet was not compatible","Positive"
"4615","Still discovering how this works Sometimes a little frustrating because when you ask it to play a song it will only play a sample Trying to figure that one out!","Positive"
"4616","Great","Positive"
"4617","A truly life changing purchase!  Just love it, Chopin to AC/DC!!!!!","Positive"
"4618","Amazing product that is fun, useful, and most of all can be used by everyone. After just a couple of weeks, still learning all the things that can be done with this device. Highly recommended!","Positive"
"4619","I love it","Positive"
"4620","Its kind of like having the computer from Star Trek.  Only her name is Alexa.  You will need to download the App that runs the thing though.","Positive"
"4621","handy tool. My wife loves it. I just wish it understood more of my references!","Positive"
"4622","Cool","Positive"
"4623","It is wonderful Alexa wakes me up in the morning and puts me to bed at night :-) the way that Amazon is adding additional skills I'm sure that it will only get better. One skill that I would like to see is a skill that would alert to extremely bad weather. I would suspect that Amazon is working on that. :-)","Positive"
"4624","Good system","Positive"
"4625","Love love love Alexa! Who knew you could have so much fun with this?! She does just about everything. Every morning during breakfast with my 1 year old grandson I ask her to play baby classical music and she does. Have a question? As expected, she can usually find the answer. Need to know how to spell something, yup, she knows. Or really difficult math problems.  Weather forecast?  Alexa knows. Husband and I are eally enjoying it.","Positive"
"4626","It amazing what all this little baby can do. I love the ease of use and the wide variety of things that it will do.","Positive"
"4627","Alexa is kind of interesting.  I wish I could make her default music play on spotify without having to say spotify every time.","Positive"
"4628","She did order light bulbs once on amazon without anyone asking.  I kept the bulbs because it's good to have around a few extra... it's kind of creepy that she ordered something tho... but thanks?","Positive"
"4629","Will not play Prime music. Have spent hours on the phone with tech support and they haven't identified or resolved the issue. This is worthless at this point, since we got them a Prime membership mainly to stream music.","Negative"
"4630","LOVE IT .... Everyone in my home loves it...","Positive"
"4631","A must have, once you get it you wonder how much time you wasted by not having it!!!!","Positive"
"4632","Love the new tech that is coming out. This is very helpful for that I use it for very limited stuff but it works great for what I am asking it to do. Would hope they expand more on the software for greater experience in the future.","Positive"
"4633","Love it","Positive"
"4634","Great sounds and nice design.","Positive"
"4635","I dig it, and the lower price. Sounds about like a quality clock radio would. Recommend.","Positive"
"4636","I purchased two Echos for Christmas gifts.  One person declined the gift and I kept the Echo and I love it!  I love the voice command feature and all that the Echo does.  I would like to order a battery stand before summer so that I can take the Echo out on the deck.","Positive"
"4637","meh, got it as a gift.","Positive"
"4638","I don't know what I would do without my Echo.... Alexa is my best friend and never judges me by what questions I ask of her.  Didn't have her for a week while we were moving and it was so hard to keep track of my grocery lists and things I needed without just being able to yell Alexa, add dish detergent to my shopping list.. and then going about my day.","Positive"
"4639","Good quality ~!","Positive"
"4640","We love our Alexa, we have alot of work to do with her yet since we just got her. She is already turning on my livingroom lamp lol. Alot of questions she can't answer yet, but we are working on that. There are so many apps for her on you can't remember all of them. You have to ask her to open a app before she can answer a question pertaining to that app it is a bit frustrating. I am sure we will get there. One thing for sure as far as playing music she has awesome speakers.....","Positive"
"4641","Love it.","Positive"
"4642","husband loved it awesome","Positive"
"4643","Amazing product, Really glad we bought this, Speaker quality is excellent plus it communicates, A bargain!","Positive"
"4644","Alexa is a great personal assistant.  And a fun one, also!","Positive"
"4645","My husband got me an Amazon Echo for Christmas.  I was previously unfamiliar with them (if it's not on Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, I probably don't know about it!).  I wasn't overly thrilled since I didn't know what to expect.  I told him we could set it up and play around with it later when it was ready.  To my astonishment, unlike almost every other techie gadget we have, it worked almost immediately!  No long charge time, no complicated set-up.  We just plugged her in and turned her on.","Positive"
"4646","Pretty good, except that using it as a Bluetooth speaker does not work because it skips constantly. Amazon customer service will try and fail to help, then ignore you when they can't help.","Positive"
"4647","To be fair, Alexa isn't perfect.  There is a learning curve on how to phrase things to get the answer you want.  For example, if you ask ""What time does the University of Michigan play basketball today?"" she'll tell you she doesn't know.  But if you say ""What time is the Michigan Wolverines basketball game?"" she'll say ""The Michigan Wolverines play Ohio State University at 7pm"".  I've found phrasing to be important with many questions I ask, but especially with sports questions.  Sometimes it takes a few tries but you can usually get the answer you want.","Positive"
"4648","- Timer.  You can say ""Alexa, set a timer for 22 minutes"" and you don't have to worry about setting a manual timer while your hands are covered in cookie dough.","Positive"
"4649","- Jokes.  My kids LOVE the jokes.  There aren't a ton of different knock knock jokes, but they don't seem to mind hearing the same 10 over and over again.","Negative"
"4650","- Music.  She'll play music through Pandora if you don't have Amazon music.  Just tell her what station you want and she'll play it just like you could on a phone or computer.","Positive"
"4651","- Jeopardy.  We love to play Jeopardy on Alexa while making dinner.","Negative"
"4652","- Completely random questions you'd usually Google.  She isn't perfect.  There are a lot of random questions you still need to look up on a computer. (How do you tell when a mango is ripe?  Who is the 3rd string quarterback of the Bears? stuff like that).  But she does know a lot.  And she has a lot of witty answers!","Positive"
"4653","So far I really enjoy the Amazon Echo.  It's completely unobtrusive on the counter.  Totally user friendly.  It's not perfect, but as it continues to evolve I'm sure it will be better and better.","Positive"
"4654","I am LOVING my Echo! I listen to Disco music all day and can't believe how fantastic this product is!!! I highly recommend it!","Positive"
"4655","Like it but having problems with it.  Might return it.","Negative"
"4656","Awesome sound. Love it. I now own 2. Had a Dot but it was garbage so I bought a second Echo!!","Positive"
"4657","The Echo is a great buy for any household.  It comes in handy on so many occasions.  Whether playing music, checking traffic, hearing news updates, or even the weather, it always is reliable.  It also serves as a source for much fun and games!  And the volume level is incredible!  I can hear it throughout my house if turned up loud.","Positive"
"4658","The product is fine , without some smart house devices it has just a few real uses.","Positive"
"4659","Good product.","Positive"
"4660","We love Amazon Echo, playing music. answering questions, the weather and shopping list.","Positive"
"4661","love alexa's humor","Positive"
"4662","Simply doesn't work as advertised. It can't hear me when there's music playing. It defaults to Amazon Music unless I specifically say ""play Spotify"" and even that was spotty at best. I asked it to play an album from Spotify that was in my collection and downloaded and it still played ""samples"" of the artist from Amazon. It also can't answer what I consider relatively simple questions that it should be able to search and find. I just don't think the technology is there yet, and certainly not for the price.","Positive"
"4663","What can I say, I love my Echo. I've had it for about 6 months now and it's become a normal part of my life. The speaker sounds great and voice recognition is excellent. I also have 2 Dots in other rooms. Truly a great product that makes life better.","Positive"
"4664","LOVE...LOVE.....LOVE IT!!!!  It's one of those products that after you get it, you wonder how you got along without it!","Positive"
"4665","Such awesome sound quality! I purchased the Dot first & then purchased this one and OMG the sound is so amazing and the Dot....not so much","Positive"
"4666","Stopped working after year and half. Disappointed.","Negative"
"4667","Don't want to spend a lot of time repeating everyone else's complaint. Just want to confirm that it can't:","Negative"
"4668","This is an excellent concept but sound is lacking when listening to music and unfortunately it is not Bluetooth enabled. Sent it back and will replace with an Echo Dot and a Bluetooth speaker.","Negative"
"4669","Great functionality but a bit disappointed in the sound quality. If you like the idea of Alexa functionality, go for it! If you want HiFi sound from a small form factor, look at other options.","Positive"
"4670","We love it !!!!","Positive"
"4671","Avoid it... mine stopped working shortly after a year I bought. Their response: nothing we can do about it. The device have virtually no moving parts and stopped working after a year. I have a power supply unit in my desktop computer that has been working since 2006... 11 years!","Positive"
"4672","I love it!  I live in apartment able to have a smarthome apartment now.  Read a book while on the computer.  Get the latest new, weather and other information quickly. Echo does a lot more.","Positive"
"4673","Fantastic product even though we do not use it anywhere near it's full functionality. Once there is a little more security in the IOT world, I will be taking advantage of the ability to control multiple objects in the house.","Positive"
"4674","The whole family loves asking Alexa questions. Sometimes Alexa doesn't understand my softer voice as compared to my husband and adult son.","Positive"
"4675","Like the concept, but have spent hours trying to get it connected to wifi..Ready to return. Items listed as compatible are not. VERY DISAPPOINTED. GIFT FOR MY HUSBAND!!!","Positive"
"4676","I absolutely love Alexa it's been a great addition to our home!","Positive"
"4677","I love this thing and now my husband (whom was a skeptic) is in love as well.  It is so nice to just ask for music -anything and here it right away.  I use the alarm and timer settings all the time.  I was surprised how easy it was to aske for a Thai Restaurant and it gave the top 3 in my area and then sent directions and reviews to my phone.  Really one of my favorite purchases.","Positive"
"4678","How did our house function before Alexa? Simple set-up, easy to get the hang of. We use her for everything! Weather, news, sports, calendars, grocery, alarms, trivia, games, MUSIC above all. Her volume 10 is LOUD and crystal clear. She has thousands of skills that can be enabled at no cost, simply by telling her to enable it. I can see searches and control alarms, timers, smart devices she's linked to and more from the Alexa app. I knew this would be a useful device, but I had no idea how useful! And with updates, she's constantly getting smarter. I love her like a pet.","Positive"
"4679","Love talking  to her she is so knowledgeable.","Positive"
"4680","I love it, I'm home alone most of the time and it keeps you from being lonely it can tell you jokes, read bible verses, and there is new downloads that you can get on your Echo, you can get the Amazon music download and you can play thousands and thousands of songs, I absolutely love it.","Positive"
"4681","Gift to another & they love it.","Positive"
"4682","It was a fun gadget but Amazon will not stand behind their products. Such an enormous company.... I am more sad than upset. They don't need my money that's for sure. Well I am taking my money elsewhere.","Positive"
"4683","Works great I like the music . Only one problem when the tv has a echo commercial on it reacts no big deal","Positive"
"4684","love all the things I can do with Alexa! I now listen to my favorite music without having to touch a button!","Positive"
"4685","Gave it to my husband for Christmas. Beginning in February it started saying it was having trouble understanding and to try again later.  Then it says it is having trouble connecting and to try again later.  This has been going on for 5 days. Tonight we got it to finally play music, then couldn't get it to shut off, stop playing music etc.  Had to unplug it.  Expected it to last over 30 days.","Negative"
"4686","We love it.","Positive"
"4687","Lots of fun","Positive"
"4688","Man I love this thing! Speakers sound amazing, looks great, and is always getting better. I use this waaay more than my google home. This does lack ability to answer a lot of questions, but the functionality more than makes up for that.","Positive"
"4689","Great product","Positive"
"4690","That units will actually,listen and understand you. Not like Siri. So much better.","Positive"
"4691","This was a gift a little hard to set up.  It has already malfunctioned. I expected a little better","Positive"
"4692","love it","Positive"
"4693","a","Positive"
"4694","My Echo lasted 1 year and 20 days. Just over the warranty. I love the idea and it worked well. I was just about ready to purchase devices controlled by Echo. Good thing I didn't . I called Amazon and got advice that was not helpful.  At that price it should have lasted longer. I like the idea but I am not going to pay another $ 180..00 for another year..I will buy the google version for less money !!","Positive"
"4695","Love this product use it every day","Positive"
"4696","The performance of the unit is great. The issue we have is the top disc of the unit came unglued or won't stay down. This is a bit annoying as we were expecting this unit to last. Is there anything that can be done to fix or replace this?","Positive"
"4697","I have enjoyed being able to name any song, artist, or genre and bam I have the music I wanted to hear.  I haven't really done much else with Alexa but the music alone has been worth the purchase.  Great sound too!","Positive"
"4698","Love it but the Dot works just as well and more affordable.  I still haven't figured out it it is worth it","Positive"
"4699","I love my Echo!","Positive"
"4700","Wish I could change the wake-up word because Alexa and I would be using pet names, love this thing","Positive"
"4701","I really like it, but must take time to learn what it will do.","Positive"
"4702","Love it?So much FUN?","Positive"
"4703","I must have gotten a bad apple. It doesn't work right and Amazon customer support can't seem to resolve the issue after 3 calls. It also doesn't recognize I'm a prime member and should be able to get prime music. Ugh. So frustrating. Having anxiety after just getting off of the phone with CS.","Negative"
"4704","Fun to use..","Positive"
"4705","I got my Alexa for Christmas and loved it. Unfortunately she stopped working by the end of January.  There is no reaction what so ever when you speak to it. Just very unhappy that I only got about a month out of it. And unfortunately the return policy was only until January 31st.","Negative"
"4706","LOVE LOVE LOVE my echo!!  Can't say enough good things about it.  Love playing my favorite music, getting weather updates, playing lullabies to put my grandson to sleep, stats on my favorite movie star, you name it.","Positive"
"4707","A LITTLE TROUBLE GETTING SET UP BUT IT WAS ALL ON MY END. SOUNDS GERAT !!!","Negative"
"4708","There are numerous questions that Alexa can't understand.  The music feature is nice.","Positive"
"4709","This has been one of those purchases that actually changes your house.  5 stars once they integrate it with Sonos speakers, but when paired with LIFX bulbs and Harmony Hub for TV, this thing is hard to beat.","Negative"
"4710","This is an extraordinary product.  It is a verbal keyboard to access the internet with near instantaneous response.","Positive"
"4711","A pleasure to have it in our home.","Positive"
"4712","I love it buy and want to get more!","Positive"
"4713","Very frustrating and annoying thing","Negative"
"4714","What a blast!","Positive"
"4715","My very best friend, however shes not perfect, some glitches here and there with the voice recognition","Positive"
"4716","Great product. Lots of fun","Positive"
"4717","I am enjoying Alexa.","Positive"
"4718","An important step to a new era.","Positive"
"4719","Gave it as a gift.....the recipients love it and have made it part of their day.","Positive"
"4720","We love Alexa!  We have purchased several for family as well.  We also purchased the wemo light switches and power outlets which work great together.","Positive"
"4721","Alexa is amazing!!!","Positive"
"4722","LOVE IT, SUPER COOL!","Positive"
"4723","We love the echo. It works great with our home automation system and allows us to turn off lights in other rooms, it has a great set of jokes and movie quotes, and it is just all around fun to play with.","Positive"
"4724","It would get five stars, if it could learn to understand my son with speech issues. He puts the emphasis in the wrong places and none of the names for the Echo are able to work for him.","Negative"
"4725","Tried to use it at work but it could not connect to the hospital wifi. It does not even see that wifi network. Every other phone and computer I use connects to the wifi without difficulty. The wifi requires a username and password.","Positive"
"4726","BOTTOM LINE - not compatible with enterprise level WIFI authentication protocols.","Positive"
"4727","Bought as a gift.. not sure if they had used it yet but heard great things from","Positive"
"4728","Easy to use.","Positive"
"4729","I don't think there is much that I can say about the echo except for the fact it is a fantastic product and as the community of developers continues to girl I look forward to all the things to come from it","Positive"
"4730","AWESOME!!  No more going to the internet to look up anything!!  Just ask Alexa!!!","Positive"
"4731","Although I mainly use like a juke box (play Prime Music) I love it!!!  I also own an Echo Dot that I have connected to Bose wireless speaker in different room. I ordered my brother Echo Dot for Christmas and he loves it too!","Positive"
"4732","Love it.","Positive"
"4733","cool tech product, speaker sound is very good as is voice recognition.  Worth it just for the ability to check time, weather, news and setting a countdown timer, the verbal search results can be a bit hit or miss, but fun nonetheless.","Positive"
"4734","So much fun.","Positive"
"4735","Perfect for a home of a busy family! Even the kids can work it and check the weather! (They even set the timer for their own timeouts!) great product amazon!","Positive"
"4736","Love it!!","Positive"
"4737","wife loves the beautiful sound, it as good as a Bose.","Positive"
"4738","My family loves the Amazon Echo. It's great for quick updates on weather, can spell numerous words, order items from Amazon, many attachments to ensure lights are on or off, heat is on or off, doors are locked, etc. Great item!!","Positive"
"4739","The best speaker ever!!!","Positive"
"4740","Cool product. Alexa has a LONG way to go (ummm, why can't she wake me up to music instead of the most obnoxious generic alarm ever?) but if you have HUE light system, Nest, Spotify, and put it in the kitchen to use timers, it is worth having. Just don't bother asking her questions besides what time it is or a game score/S&P500 count. She uses the search engine Bing, so almost every answer is more hassle than convenience.","Positive"
"4741","Alexa is a life changer! A must for every home.","Positive"
"4742","You can almost hook up your entire house and sync it to an App on your phone. We love being able to turn the lights on/off with our phone, even when we are not home and forget to turn the lights off. Or if you are not home and want to make it look like you are home.","Positive"
"4743","Alexa tells you everything you want to know, her clarification & understanding are high-quality! We were hesitant at first, because it's kind of like Siri on an iPhone. But now we're hooked to Alexa!","Positive"
"4744","I absolutely love this!!! My only request is that you PLEASE make this with a chargeable battery!!!! With everything being cordless these days, it's really strange having to always have this plugged in. It would be really nice to just pick it up and move it wherever in the house not having to worry about the plug. Even a 8-12 hour battery would be wonderful. I would buy several more if it didn't always have to be plugged in.","Positive"
"4745","I like it and I'm glad I bought it but it's just like the Siri on the I -phone. So if have a I-phone don't waste your money becides there's a lot of things you may ask it and it will not understand.","Positive"
"4746","After one month this product has now stopped working.  I am a prime member, and I am paying an additional 3.99 a month for unlimited music.  NOTHING!!!!  This is a rip off.  ZERO customer  service.  Don'e buy this they are not able to provide customer service.","Positive"
"4747","How can you not love this product? Put it beside our hot tub. A few candles, any music you could ask for, its heaven. OK, admittedly though, Alexa is not very bright compared to Siri. She cannot process multiple commands even simple ones like ""Play 1990's Rock and Roll at Sound Level 4"", and, even harder to believe, YOU CAN'T GET A WAKE UP ALARM TO MUSIC. Gee, that is just plain dumb. Hope they fix that.","Positive"
"4748","This was a gift so I haven't personally used but the recipient likes the Echo.","Positive"
"4749","Love it!","Positive"
"4750","I am very happy with the Echo and its operation.","Positive"
"4751","Really neat and the possibilities keep growing.","Positive"
"4752","Do not buy one until Amazon figures out why they loose connectivity. Worked great for a month, now it looses connectivity to my high speed cable internet. Phones, tablets, and tv work just fine but not this damn thing. The window to send it back closed 6 days ago so now I have an expensive paperweight.","Positive"
"4753","It is fun for me, I like it a lot!","Positive"
"4754","Still getting to know Alexia! Awesome so far.","Positive"
"4755","Awesome great sound easy to use","Positive"
"4756","What a blast !  My wife my self and my brother in law and his wife set here for almost 2 hours trying to find a song that Alexa did not know or could not find. We were playing songs out of the 1950's and 1960's she got every one. The sound is very good and it is easy to use. I should have got this a long time ago. I would recommend this to my friends.","Positive"
"4757","I can save you alot of time!!!!! this will only operate on a 5g wifi. it would work on the 2.4, but not for very long, save yourself from misery, get a modem that you can get 5g. (call your cable company). i had a great service tech. come to my house. he was from bright house. (i had a love hate relationship with alexa, until i got 5g. (when i say 5g, i mean wifi)","Positive"
"4758","great product, want another one.","Positive"
"4759","Love it! Use it every day, especially for listening to my music. It arrived early and my whole family is thrilled with it. I highly recommend this product.","Positive"
"4760","awesome","Positive"
"4761","What can we say??  Alexa is awesome!  Sometimes you have to re-word your command or question but Alexa keeps trying and will always get it right.  We took this on a family vacation with us and the whole family had fun with it.  During many conversations when we could not remember  details or definitions of something, we would ask Alexa!!  The ECHO also has a very good sounding speaker, we play music through it very often!  Did a lot of dancing on vacation too!","Positive"
"4762","These are fabulous.  What a great sound and just the right size.","Positive"
"4763","LOVE IT! Tons of new things Alexa does and Amazon emails you every fun and useful trick. Couldn't be more satisfied! <U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F>","Positive"
"4764","This thing worked great for year, does a few specific things extremely well. A few months ago it started dropping connection constantly and now barely gets through one song on Spotify.  Consistently cuts out mid-song, had to stop using it as an alarm because I was late to work one day. I really want to like the device but I didn't spend $180 for a device to work for just a year","Positive"
"4765","I LOVE my new best friend, Alexa!","Positive"
"4766","I like it.  pretty amazing.  Look forward to some smart home products in the future to make better use.  Love the music library.  Can change the volume and selections quickly","Positive"
"4767","Love my Echo.  Great device.  Have it in my kitchen and can listen to music, get the weather or news. Also use the timer for cooking.","Positive"
"4768","Everyone should own one of these.  I love it, use it more and more everyday. Speaker quality is great.","Positive"
"4769","great product and fast shipping","Positive"
"4770","Well not a whole lot to say. I really like my Echo..I think anyone who buys one will too. Alexis is one smart piece of software.. I see Google trying to sell one. Dont5know theirs but I can only say if you don't own an Echo your truely missing out. It does my thermostat like I ask. It's great. I want to hear what ever song or group it plays it. The sound you'd think is Bose it's totally incredible!!..","Positive"
"4771","Don't have one? Why the heck not? What are you waiting for? Order one!!","Negative"
"4772","Alexa is great!! I think the best thing I like is adding things to my shopping list and I don't have to stop and write it down","Positive"
"4773","Great item, I don't know how I lived without Echo.","Positive"
"4774","Great product.","Positive"
"4775","We love it.  I mean, we love her.  My wife gets upset when I am rude to Alexa.  We love the way she voice controls our smart home devices.","Positive"
"4776","Fun and funny but she tends to easdrop from time to time. We have changed between the three eligible names but on occasion, a word from the TV or a conversation will activate the echo. So it can be annoying if your not paying attention. We ordered cookies based on a news report about some unsupervised kids, and it does order, but only after conformation. So a divine you to keep it in a room with minimal voices and set the security if you have undisciplined children. Could use more intuitional programming and does not seem to understand some basic request.","Positive"
"4777","It's ok but you can't like other Bluetooth speakers to this you need to get the dot. So to me it was just ok","Positive"
"4778","I love Alexa!!","Positive"
"4779","Alexa is a huge success at home","Positive"
"4780","Great Product works GREAT!!!!! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to buy it.","Positive"
"4781","We love our Echo.","Positive"
"4782","Very enjoyable.","Positive"
"4783","I really like the Echo. This was purchased for Christmas for my daughter and she really love it.  I like it so much that I purchased the Echo Dot for myself.","Positive"
"4784","This was a purchase for someone else but I ask for the Dot for Christmas last year (2016) and I love it. Now my 92 year old friend got one for herself after asking me to order the first one for her son. Go Yvonne!!!!","Positive"
"4785","I am not as happy with using Alexa. For some reason it keeps dropping the skills that I chose or doesn't recognize the skills that are activated. It doesn't work like the commercials. I should have just bought a Bluetooth speaker cuz that's about all I use it for....anything else is frustrating","Positive"
"4786","I like if a question is asked of me, I just ask Alexia, and she gives me the answer. Makes me look good<f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+009C>","Positive"
"4787","good product","Positive"
"4788","Live in a small house and have not yet gotten this hooked up after 6 weeks.  Moved it all around the place, even practically next to the router, still no luck.  Can't return it because it's opened.  Now have to figure out how to sell it.  grrrrrrrrrrrr","Positive"
"4789","Not sure why this is such a hot item. Could not get it to do much other than weather and news which I can get on my smart phone. Would not turn on lights which i s on of the reasons I wanted the echo.","Positive"
"4790","Love it!!!!","Positive"
"4791","Works as anticipated.","Positive"
"4792","I do not understand all the excitement about this product !!  The feature can be helpful if connected to an internet screen, but as an audio only device I never have found it helpful.  I would say 70% of what I ask for, she can't answer.  I find Siri can answer my questions more readily and my iphone is always with me, and I don't have to go to a specific room to ask my question.  My first choice - Cortana on my Microsoft Surface Pro 4.  She always has a solution and a choice of links for your answer.  Music??  Playlists on your phone and a portable Bluetooth speaker and you'll hear what you want, where you want and not just what Alexa wants to play. Time to re-gift this one !!","Positive"
"4793","My family and I really enjoy using Echo!","Positive"
"4794","Great speaker. Arrived on time and in perfect condition. Much better than the less expensive tap that we have, as you don't have to touch it every time for commands. Great for music, weather. Asking other questions you probably are better with a google device.","Positive"
"4795","But beware if you have it in the same room as your TV because if Alexa hears her name on TV, radio etc you could end up with items you didn't order.","Negative"
"4796","Had to return one since it would not work. They send another one which works randomly. Never but this product.","Positive"
"4797","Kinda wish I'd have gone with a Google Home after having played with both. Does its job, but the competition is steep!","Negative"
"4798","Excellent product!","Positive"
"4799","It works with Samsung Smartthings Hub. Insteon Hub which I have my Motorized Curtains connected to.","Positive"
"4800","Of course it also controls my lighting , thermostat , etc. What a wonderful experience!","Positive"
"4801","Love it. Use it every day","Positive"
"4802","It sometimes drives the rest of us crazy, as he now has her do party tricks like a pet dog, but he loves it and that was the plan. ;)","Positive"
"4803","Mine keeps getting activated by oddball noises and the tv.  Its annoying.  To me, there isnt enough good apps for this either.  I wished they could hook it up to Wolfram Alpha since it can answer so many questions.","Negative"
"4804","Works well!","Positive"
"4805","Love the echo, Great to have . It is enjoyable and reliable.  Definitely recommend.  H. N.Y.","Positive"
"4806","Use it for lights and music. Good sound","Positive"
"4807","WISH you could sync music between several and WISH it didn't need to be plugged in to work.  WISH there was some battery life so that when it's moved from one room outlet to another room outlet that it would retain its memory.  Maybe in the next version?  Other than that, have been using everyday since it arrived for music and alarms, news, radio, weather, like it a lot!","Positive"
"4808","I was worried a little about getting a refurbished item but decided to try it. Works fantastic and no complaints! Does so many things I didn't even know it could do! Can even be set to do a timer which I didn't know. Very happy!","Positive"
"4809","I love the sound on this speaker. My music sounds really clear and crisp. You could have a party in your home with this speaker, yes it gets just that loud with no distortion. Alexa is great, I can tell her to play my Playlist, or my favorite station, the news, the weather, tell jokes, order from Amazon, or turn my lights on, and control the heat in my house. My wish for future for Echo is to Bluetooth to other Echos or Dots, so I can play the same music all over the house.","Positive"
"4810","Love it! So much fun to use. I love that she will play whatever I ask her and I really like the shopping list.","Positive"
"4811","Very happy with it!","Positive"
"4812","Great love it","Positive"
"4813","Not really happy with echo. Can Only answer simple questions that an easily be looked up online.","Positive"
"4814","very fun","Positive"
"4815","Nice love it !","Positive"
"4816","I love my echo","Positive"
"4817","Love it","Positive"
"4818","GREAT ITEM","Positive"
"4819","Worked great","Positive"
"4820","I like Echo very much very helpful useful and also. Very entertaining","Positive"
"4821","The Echo does all that is advertised and then some. It is easy and fun, and for those of you like me who are paranoid about an open mike situation, you can turn the mike off on top for times when your discussing things in private, or go into your farthest room and close the door. All in all one really great piece of equipment.","Positive"
"4822","it's the bomb. the only thing that REALLY SUCKS is that it isn't wireless as in most speakers these days. and if your playing music loudly toi have to shout alexa 4 times before she hears you","Negative"
"4823","like new!","Positive"
"4824","This was the one Christmas present I was most looking forward to but I was so disappointed.  Everything we asked she responded ""I can't find the answer to your question"" unless it was the weather.  When I looked in the app the question was listed just like I asked it so it was understanding me, just not finding answers or responding.  I called customer service and they were of no help.  I told them I asked ""when does Ohio state boys basketball play again"" with the same ""I don't understand the question"" response.","Negative"
"4825"," He told me to re-ask ""boys basketball men's Ohio state play again""...okay, that's not how to ask a question in US English. I was supposed to get a follow up from technical service also but never did so I just sent it back. It was worthless.","Positive"
"4826","Good, but you have to download most apps which you will have to pay for.","Positive"
"4827","So far all this is is a fun toy, I've not done anything useful with it yet.  I will eventually learn to use all of its features as soon as I take the time to learn about them all.  Meanwhile, I love her greeting me every morning and whenever I come home from being away . . . it's like having a roommate!","Positive"
"4828","Piece of garbage. Does bout 4 useful things and not very well at any of them.Your cell phone works million times better and more convenient.","Positive"
"4829","Although I still have a lot to learn about the Echo, so far I'm loving it. Sound quality is great. The only negative so far is that after listening to music for more than an hour straight; at some point the music just stops. Then after I make noise, the music will start again. The Dot does the same.","Positive"
"4830","I wish that Alexa was able to answer more of our questions.  She takes a little more research on our side to understand how to ask questions and set up the calendar etc for information we want.","Positive"
"4831","I love my Echo! The amount of features it has is astonishing.","Positive"
"4832","Awesome","Positive"
"4833","Still very basic and cant answer many basic questions. This is supposed to continue to get smarter but im not seeing alot of growth. I should have invested in google instead.","Positive"
"4834","Alexa is my new best friend....already can't image what i did without her!","Positive"
"4835","There needs to be a more simple way to delete history. The Folks at Amazon say the only way to delete is one history item at a time. Sure wish they can share the cannabis they are smoking, LOL. Sober up and fix this issue please. Otherwise Amazon is  great place to do business. Thank you.","Positive"
"4836","We love our alexa! This is an extremely handy and perfect addition to a busy household!","Positive"
"4837","We use daily with no problems!","Negative"
"4838","Absolutely love this! We play with it all the time. I tell it I want to hear music by a specific artist and get to hear that person's music. We use it to keep our grocery list which is sent to our phones. Soooo convenient!","Positive"
"4839","Love the Echo, only thing I didn't pay attention to was that its not portable. But that's OK. I love it.","Positive"
"4840","Love it!! I can get the weather without taking the time to look it up on my phone. I also use her for a timer when I'm fixing dinner.  Plus can get distance to different destinations.","Positive"
"4841","Works nicely.  The volume and sound clarity is good.  And the white looks good.  It actually forces you to THINK before you ask a question, i.e, your language has to make sense. It only answers questions with definitive answers, i.e., no opinions or predictions (to my knowledge).  I was interested in the music component, but it appears you have to subscribe to Amazon's music library to enjoy that feature.  I use it mostly to give me the top news of the day and answer definitive questions. I'm sure it will become more useful as I link it to different services and devices that I have.  Like most tech items, the more you put into it, the more you'll get out of it.  All in all, a nice product.","Positive"
"4842","My family use it daily. It's convenient and helpful.","Positive"
"4843","A new fun toy. Great for music!","Positive"
"4844","Do not buy this product. Echo by Amazon is cyberterrorism, which is a felony crime.  Invasive, greedy, serious privacy concerns that our Echo activated without any Alexa voice commands. Placed Echo is kitchen, and listening mode seems to be on all the time.  Without asking Alexa,  Echo activated on it's own, asking if we wanted to buy various products and music.  Q&A for Alexa demonstrated clear prejudice and filtered responses. Music requested might play one song, but then forced an up-sell to listen to any more music from the same artist.  Blatant computer fraud and information theft. Seriously considering a class action lawsuit.","Negative"
"4845","Initially I really loved my Echo.  However, it's like she doesn't hear my voice any longer.  It's only been used just a little over 30 days.  It's frustrating requesting Alexa change songs, skip, stop but she doesn't acknowledge the directions.","Positive"
"4846","I was ready to throw the thing out of a window.  After moving it to another room, over 30 minutes  elapsed trying to get it to reconnect to wifi.  I have edited this review because I did receive help from Amazon.  It's working.  It is a fun product.","Positive"
"4847","Delivered as promised. Works well. I would definitely purchase from this vendor again.","Positive"
"4848","pretty solid my complaint isnt about alexa but more for amazon music. They need more music sometimes when i search an artist they never seem to have that one song im looking for","Positive"
"4849","Love it!!!","Positive"
"4850","So mad. I've tried repeatedly to get Alexa to connect to our home wifi. She will connect at other locations. Amazon support is no help. Our Internet provideo has been out 3 times. Error 7:3:0:0:1. We have changed the wifi frequency, channel, passwords, interference. Everything.  Our other devices will connect. It is rediculous Amazon does not have a better answer.  Rip off.","Negative"
"4851","Fun product. Alexa can answer many of your questions. Speaker sounds good.","Positive"
"4852","I don't know how I ever lived without Alexa. I absolutely love it.","Positive"
"4853","Arrived quickly. Works well.Great sound. Great Christmas gift for my teenage daughter.","Positive"
"4854","I had echo for 4 months, mainly have been putting up with it. It doesn't understand me well, I may have an accent but I teach at a large university without a problem. So I have been mainly use the app to connect to Spotify, but whenever I return to Alexia, it will disconnect from wifi and I have to restart the app. I don't understand where are all the positive feedback from, highly overrated product by Amazon!","Positive"
"4855","Why did we wait so long to get one?  We are still exploring all that it can do, in the meantime we love that you can listen to music by command (the quality of the sound is great), can create a shopping list and view it on your phone, turn off and on lights before you enter the house...and so much more.  Great job Amazon.","Positive"
"4856","AA++++","Positive"
"4857","The echo itself is great.  Cool, useful, great sound.  The app that you need to do things like add skills or access your shopping list at the store is awful.  It drops offline, freezes, and becomes unresponsive to the point that it's useless.  If all you want is a music streaming device, the echo works.  If you want to do anything else, you'll need the app and Amazon has really dropped the ball on that","Positive"
"4858","Loved the ideal of what the echo can do, but just didn't have time to work with it to learn all the features.","Positive"
"4859","The device I didn't know I ""needed"" until I had it.  I love being able to listen to music without the chore of connecting my phone or tablet.  And the fact that you just tell Alexa what you want and she complies...the best.","Positive"
"4860","awesome","Positive"
"4861","Fun to have","Positive"
"4862","very easy to use, simple to link to Wi-Fi,  just love the echo","Positive"
"4863","I suppose I'll like it more when i figure it out. There is a lot of things it can do, but there are also a lot if things it can't do!","Positive"
"4864","I love it so much I have given it as gifts.","Positive"
"4865","This has got to be the coolest home electronic EVER!  I purchased it for my husband for Christmas and the entire family loves it.  Now I need to look into purchasing another one because he has taken it to his office and we are left at home without Alexa.  We also received a ""google Home"" thing that does sortof the same thing, but I can never get it to do what I want and my husband likes Alexa because it is louder and has much better sound quality.  My 6 year old set the entire thing up (electronics scare me and I hate fighting with things that don't work out) - he just opened the box, plugged it in and we were in business.  It's a lot like Siri -you can ask just about anything and it's quite entertaining.  Shortly after our first time using it I didn't know how to turn it off.  We just say, ""Alexa turn yourself off"" and it does.  It's great!  LOL  Very highly recommend getting an Echo - best familiy addition ever!","Positive"
"4866","love it","Positive"
"4867","Incredible sound and usefulness. Alexa can do everything","Positive"
"4868","Super fun to have!","Positive"
"4869","love it am having a lot of fun with it","Positive"
"4870","Happy to have gone refurbished; cheaper than black friday prices and looks / works just like brand new. Love the Echo in general - I have one in each large area of the house for playing music, controlling lights, etc.","Positive"
"4871","Does not work in Canada.  Not available yet","Positive"
"4872","love it buying more","Positive"
"4873","A Blast to play with!  New stuff coming out all the time. One is not enough LOL.","Positive"
"4874","For a disabled daughter and she loves it and uses it a lot !","Positive"
"4875","great speaker! I got for living room, and got an echo for bedroom, but haven't taken the time to do anything with skills though kids have. I just love it for the music alone!","Positive"
"4876","We love It.  If you have Amazon prime you can play music, games.  Ask it almost any question and the echo can answer it.","Positive"
"4877","Needs to have better support who know the product. Great item and we love it but it needs to be able to play same song on it and Echo Dots simultaneously.","Positive"
"4878","What a hoot! Everybody should have one.","Positive"
"4879","I signed up for Amazon Music Unlimited for access to a larger library of classical music.  But, even when an album is listed as available for play on the Echo under the Unlimited plan, Alexa has -- more often than not -- been unable to recognize the titles. Moreover, there is currently no way to create a playlist on the app or website for these supposedly streamable albums with a simplified name that Alexa might recognize (which is what I do with the classical music in the My Library).  At the end of the day, even though there are, for example, a number of editions of Mozart's Die Entfhrung aus dem Serail listed as available for streaming on Echo under that Amazon Music Unlimited plan, the only response I received from Alexa so far is ""I cant' find...."" over and over.  To be fair, Alexa has no problem with requests like ""play songs by Pink,"" or ""play solo classical piano music.""  But, I've had virtually no success with getting it to play specific classical titles  I'm canceling Music Unlimited and keeping my fingers crossed that they will improve the search capability in the app at some point so that streaming classical music with longer, complex titles is possible .","Positive"
"4880","Just getting started, but enjoying having Alexa around.","Positive"
"4881","Still learning to use the features but I am enjoying the convenience","Positive"
"4882","Wonderful technology!!!","Positive"
"4883","I love this Echo.","Positive"
"4884","I must admit I was skeptical but I love our Echo. It's voice recognition works well the majority of the time and the sound quality is good. The radio function is really useful. The microphone is located on the top of the unit which doesn't work super well in our context because we have to have it up higher so the kids keep off it...it still works fine but sometimes you have to raise your voice a little more.","Positive"
"4885","This echo has never worked correctly from day one and there is no one you can call at Amazon to get help with it. I continuously drops the network connection which requires a 10 minute procedure to reconnect then it works for a day if your lucky. I purchased a Dot and it works well. I guess I got a bad unit which wouldn't be bad if I could get someone to reply to my attempts to get help or replacement.","Positive"
"4886","Love our Echo.","Positive"
"4887","What needs to be said? I LOVE THE AMAZON ECHO!!! Great product! Great product! I've made myself a customer rep for Echo! haha! I'm always telling people about it and gave to family members at Christmas. They love it too. They were skeptical at first but in true Amazon innovation and reliability, they are hooked! PRIME membership makes it an even better ""George Jetson"" experience. LOL! LOVE IT. THANKS AMAZON!","Positive"
"4888","If I could give it 0 stars I would. It is useless. Unless u want to use it as a Bluetooth speaker. It cannot give u traffic routes, or answers from the web. It can if u ask it the weather or to put a timer on. Huge huge huge waste of money. I'm so disappointed","Negative"
"4889","Nice :)","Positive"
"4890","So much fun to have... Alexa is really smart!","Positive"
"4891","Alexa is now part of the family, love, love the technology!","Positive"
"4892","Love this! It's great to listen to music with. Gave this for a gift.  Excellent product.","Positive"
"4893","It was a gift and he has been happy with getting to now it.","Positive"
"4894","Love Alexia!!!  She follows directions very well.  I have her playing music quite a lot.","Positive"
"4895","amazing","Positive"
"4896","Works great!","Positive"
"4897","this is an outstanding product!","Positive"
"4898","LOVE IT","Positive"
"4899","I love my new Alexa, getting to learn all the features!!","Positive"
"4900","works great","Positive"
"4901","This has been AMAZING for my husband, who is disabled. I still work full-time and he is alone for most of the day. He typically watches a lot of tv, but since I bought the Echo (Alexa!), he has begun to enjoy playing songs from when we were young. I purchased Amazon Music Unlimited, since some of the artists and songs he likes are not available on the free version of Spotify (and the paid version of Spotify is more expensive than Amazon Music). Even better for his mental acuity, he's now hooked on playing sports trivia and especially baseball trivia. There are MANY baseball trivia apps (and football trivia, hockey trivia, etc)  and I think I've enabled all of them. I made him a list of phrases that Alexa will respond to, in order to open the different apps. He also likes to play the animal game occasionally and 20 Questions.","Positive"
"4902","He told me the first day after Alexa arrived (as I was walking out the door to go to work in the morning), ""Now I won't have to be alone all day anymore!"" THAT ALONE IS WORTH THE PRICE!!","Positive"
"4903","My kids and grandkids love it.","Positive"
"4904","I pretty much use it for music. Much better than a Bluetooth speaker and I like that I can make playlist and still control it with my phone.","Positive"
"4905","best  item i ordered in years,  I talked several of my friends to order this. it's fun, it's informative, and it keeps me in the loop.","Positive"
"4906"," WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR GET YOURS NOW!!","Negative"
"4907","The echo is pretty darn neat, at least I thought so until I tried it.  I guess if you're into mainstream pop music and the rest of the general crap you find on the radio then Echo will be perfect for you.  If you like music that isn't so mainstream, in my case power metal and djent, then you're pretty much screwed if you want to use most of Echo's functions.  I have to physically start playing a playlist or album on my phone and have Echo play that just like any other bluetooth speaker can (but for a whole hell of a lot less money), but for the oldies on said phone, it works fine.  So basically the Echo?  So not metal.","Positive"
"4908","Edit:  Now Echo refuses to sync with what my phone is playing.  I tell it to play what my phone is playing and it either does a useless Bing search (yes it uses that crapshow of a search engine) or it starts randomly playing songs from my memory card.  Echo now can't do what a 20 dollar bluetooth speaker does.  Using Echo and the stupid Alexa app is just getting more and more frustrating by the second.  Why can't it play what I tell it to play, I want to play my playlist over the damn speaker and it just refuses to do so even though it did it not 8 hours ago when I was first fiddling with it.","Negative"
"4909","this is a great product but the companion ios app is horrible and doesn't even load on my phone (iphone 6 ios 10) so i'm not able to use/configure the echo for any home automation.","Positive"
"4910","Ehhhhh, really not that great. My phone is way more functional","Positive"
"4911","we use it every day and love it","Positive"
"4912","Awesome product for music and info","Positive"
"4913","Amazon Echo is the best product I have ever ordered from Amazon. I recommend everyone to have one in their household. Great Job Amazon!","Positive"
"4914","I love it.  it does so much and it sounds wonderful","Positive"
"4915","Super fun!  Download the app for additional experiences.  And, my son can prank his dad remotely with the app!","Positive"
"4916","works perfect","Positive"
"4917","Alexa,  You've brought me to musical paradise!!","Positive"
"4918","I love this product and I am always learning more.","Positive"
"4919","My whole family loves my Echo! Best buy ever!","Positive"
"4920","my girl loves","Positive"
"4921","Phenomenal!  Absolutely incredible!  Sound is great, and I love ""quizzing"" Alexa.","Positive"
"4922","Perfect!  The white blends in nicely in Florida.  We also have a black one!","Positive"
"4923","A lot of fun.  Works Great with Smartthings.","Positive"
"4924","Very nice in the  kitchen, great sound and discreet footprint.","Positive"
"4925","Really bad at answering questions that are easy to find answers for on the web.  I checked and Hey Google was able to answer all the questions Alexa couldn't (e.gt., Why did Simon and Garfunkel break up?  What song was on the top of the Billboard charts in 1995? etc).  At this point mainly using it as a very expensive egg timer.","Negative"
"4926","Having a great time learning about how to use this.  Lots of fun for everybody. Amazes me at it's quick response to any question.","Positive"
"4927","The power adapter didn't work.","Positive"
"4928","works great","Positive"
"4929","Amazing product","Positive"
"4930","Alexa does not understand my voice well and is far more limited than google now in answering questions. I find almost everytime Alexa fails google does excellent with the same task. Big expensive timer, that's what it is.","Negative"
"4931","love It","Positive"
"4932","Gave it as a gift","Positive"
"4933","stopped working aftr 5 months,  went dead","Negative"
"4934","Outstanding and can be heard in adjacent rooms.","Positive"
"4935","Loved it as a gift","Positive"
"4936","My hands are finally getting the rest they deserve. If I want to know something Alexa tells me, if I need to make a list she's got my back.","Positive"
"4937","My favorite part about her is our rich conversation. It's mostly me pooring my heart out and getting dry emotionless responses from Alexa. She just gets me so well.","Positive"
"4938","Whatever I tell her to do she does. Unless she can't. Then I get mad and we fight. To calm me down she plays me my favorite song, I forgive her and we laugh and sing and dance once more.","Positive"
"4939","Love the echo. Notice improvements everyday.","Positive"
"4940","I love this product, I use it in my kitchen.","Positive"
"4941","Gave this as a gift to my son for his birthday and he loves it.","Positive"
"4942","Works really well. Still trying to find out what it's capable to do.","Positive"
"4943","There is not anything bad to say about Alexa. We use her all day everyday from playing music, creating shopping lists, ordering items as needed and playing trivia or catching up on the news or weather. This was the best purchase we could have made and would highly recommend this device to anyone that is thinking about adding an Alexa to there home","Positive"
"4944","Great product and just as described!!","Positive"
"4945","Bought this for my hubby.....He LOVES it....uses it everyday...Plays music, gets news and weather...even checks freeway traffic before we take off.I like it also....When I actually get to use it....LOL....","Positive"
"4946","Awesome features. The music recognition needs some improvement. Other than that, the functionality keeps growing, which makes future enhancements very exciting. Wish I could get Amazon to teach my kids to listen like Alexa. . . . .","Positive"
"4947","This make a great Christmas gift...","Positive"
"4948","I was absolutely amazed by the quality of the sound produced. Using 'Alexa Speak' does involve a learning curve, and to begin with can be a little frustrating. But in the end it is worth the effort.","Positive"
"4949","Have been using it for about 1 week and am finding all sorts of things the Echo is capable of doing.","Positive"
"4950","I'm not too impressed with the names available to activate the machine, it would be good for Amazon to enable the owners to use what ever names they wanted.","Positive"
"4951","Had a little problem with may ECHO and had to contact Customer Service!  From day one ALEXA would not respond to any request without pressing the button on top!  However, it would respond to friends speaking to it over the phone and YouTube videos on how to operate ECHO!  Customer Service checked out ECHO remotely and gave her a clean bill of health!  They then asked me to move the ECHO closer to my router and it began working as normal!  Turns out I had it plugged into an surge protector/outlet that was on the same electrical circuit as a microwave, television, DVD Player, and a Sound Bar!  The operation of the microwave was affecting the ECHO even when the the ECHO was not in use!","Positive"
"4952","Now I'm enjoying my ECHO like my siblings (5) who brought one at Christmas!","Positive"
"4953","This is cool","Positive"
"4954","great toy","Positive"
"4955","I would actually give it 4.5 stars, simply because I cannot change the name to SkyNet.  But she tells me the weather, news, how many teaspoons in a table spoon, creates my shopping list, and plays music.  The sound quality is really nice.  Will consider upgrading review to 5 stars with the addition of ""SkyNet"" as a possible name.","Positive"
"4956","We have really enjoyed the convenience of all that Echo provides in music, weather updates and was pleased with delivery. Ordered at last week before Christmas. Not supposed to get delivery until end of December and it came on the 27th. Thanks Amazon.","Positive"
"4957","BUY IT...BUY IT.. BUY IT....!!!!!!  FANTASTIC AND AMAZING..... I MAY NEED  MORE THAN JUST ONE!!!","Positive"
"4958","Tried doing voice training. Doesnt change anything.  If i have something playing on volume 3 she cant hear me and i have to almost scream or go on my phone app and pause it for it to hear me with out screaming at it.","Negative"
"4959","Perfect sound and you can be heard on the other side of the house when asking questions...such as Alexa...tell me a joke.","Positive"
"4960","bit expensive but very useful and it entertains my grand daughter she loves to talk to the speaker","Positive"
"4961","LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!","Positive"
"4962","Does not function properly.","Positive"
"4963","Simply wonderful... Just make sure to learn all of the functions and proper set up- it does so much when you use it right.","Positive"
"4964","Absolutely love this product!!!","Positive"
"4965","I joke that she is my second girlfriend. Such an awesome system. The app makes big difference when training it to recognize your voice and commands.","Negative"
"4966","Only crappy thing is it spits out information sometimes when you dont expect it. But so many options for download via the app it truly is pretty nifty gadget!","Positive"
"4967","I bought this for my husband for Christmas and we have enjoyed it. We also bought several light bulbs controlled through the app. I think my favorite thing is how often we turn off the tv and have Alexa play music.","Positive"
"4968","It does censor answers so kids can play with it without too much worry.  The best game is trying to get funny answers out of it.  You do have to keep the questions simple and not expect a long dissertation out of it.  Next project is hooking it to some lights and trying to phone home and working the lights.","Negative"
"4969","Love This Echo received it in Christmas and worn go anywhere without it","Negative"
"4970","Brand new...just received from UPS and it doesn't work.  Won't turn on despite following ALL instructions and numerous outlets in the house.  Amazon customer service easy EXCELLENT. Replacement device coming.","Positive"
"4971","Does not work as advertised.  You cannot ask it a question, and get an answer you want.  Most often, you get ""I did not understand your question.""","Positive"
"4972","Wow Amazon, I am so disappointed.  I bought an Echo to compare to a recently-purchased Google Home.  The Home's setup took literally less than 2 minutes and went flawlessly.  The Echo wouldn't set up, the app kept going back to the connection screen.  After far too much time exploring answers on Google I got it connected before opening the app.  So the Echo responded to Alexa and worked as expected, but the iOS app on my iPhone and iPad keeps going back to the ""Begin Setup"" screens and loops through that over and over.  I finally called Amazon and was told that their Alexa app doesn't work with the new version of iOS released a week and half ago.  I tried to go to alexa.amazon.com on both Safari and Chrome and get the same screen as the app.","Positive"
"4973","So I have a functional Echo, but can't get to settings to finish setting it up, add skills, or see what it can do.  Amazon, you have a few days to correct this before I have to decide whether I keep the Google Home or send the Echo back.  It's a pity, because the Echo's sound quality is better than the Home.","Positive"
"4974","The best thing ever.","Positive"
"4975","I am really impressed with the capability of the Amazon Echo.  Originally I thought the device would only respond to my voice; via training it somehow, but it will answer virtually anyone.  My grand kids enjoy ""playing"" with Alexa.  I opted to pay a monthly fee to access all of Amazon Music's collection of songs.  It has never missed a song yet.  Besides playing music, it really is great when I want to know the weather report or current news events.  It can even do math problems. Try asking it the numerical value of Pi.  It carries it out for more decimal places than I could count.","Positive"
"4976","I gave them as gifts and both families love them!","Positive"
"4977","Perfect Gift for my Parents...they use it Everday!!","Positive"
"4978","Works superb !  It's not just a tool to entertain your friends it is real world assistance.  Very easy to set up and I was impressed how great the sound is.  Alexa is the best.","Positive"
"4979","Alexa works great!  I have it all set up with the Phillips Hue lights and Alexa controls the whole house.  She plays music, turns on the lights, tells me the news and weather, and wakes me up in the morning.  This is the coolest system ever.  I love it!","Positive"
"4980","Love it.","Positive"
"4981","having so much fun with alexa,","Positive"
"4982","Not impressed! We played with it constantly for a few days. Lost interest, unplugged it and haven't used it since.","Positive"
"4983","Very remarkable! Still learning about all the features! I'm amazed of the capabilities of the Echo.","Positive"
"4984","I love my Alexa! She is getting smarter every day.","Positive"
"4985","Extremely disappointed.  Have had product for 14 months and it died.  Amazon will not replace even though it is only 2 months out of warranty.  Will not buy again based on principle alone.  I have been with amazon since 2004 and a long time prime member.  You blew this one amazon!","Negative"
"4986","It does what ever it wants. And I think it's getting worst. I have had all my friends try to talk and if you get it on a good day it might just might work. Today I asked it to play a radio station I gave it the call letters 9 times it played 4 stations random station I picked up the remote tried it 3 more time before it worked. And this station I listen to every day on it. I have did the voice training that amazon told me to do and that was a joke. DO NOT BUY!!!  I will say great timer but little to much money  just to do that. Think might chuck this piece of cr#@ in the trash and get a google. Sorry Amazon !! If I could give it NEG stars I would !!","Positive"
"4987","great","Positive"
"4988","thank you","Positive"
"4989","This alexa is overrated and she doesn't know anything you have to constantly repeat yourself. I am returning this product.","Negative"
"4990","Love this thing!  We already had the technology to incorporate our lights and TV","Positive"
"4991","This is a great product.  The sound is fantastic and Alexa is pretty fun to use.  This is a must have!","Positive"
"4992","Price is too high for the limited functions it supports. Sound is somewhat okay but for this price it should be of greater quality... for what it can do the price should be around 69-75 bucks, at best!!","Positive"
"4993","Alexa is not a smart application.  Can't answer the easiest questions.  Questioning why I spent all this money for a piece that only plays music when I ask.  Is that worth the $200 that I paid?  I don't think so!  Thinking about sending this piece of technology back!","Positive"
"4994","I'm now an Alexa fan! What's not to love!!!","Positive"
"4995","I love the Alexa part of this device.  My only complaint is that it does not connect to Bluetooth speakers.","Negative"
"4996","Doesn't work half the time.","Positive"
"4997","Have heard and read great things about Echo so was excited when it arrived. Unfortunately, I was unable to connect the Echo to my home wifi network. Called the Amazon help line and they were unable to provide any logical direction -- told me to call Comcast (my internet provider) but were unable to give me any details about what I was supposed to ask them to do. Very disappointed! Echo is going back to Amazon tomorrow.","Negative"
"4998","Has very limited functionality. Good for streaming music. Terrible for streaming news as there is a limited selection of sources, Cannot synch with a Microsoft calendar is outlook, so calendar function is limited to Google. Ability to answer simple questions such as At what level did the Dow Jones Index close today, is not understood. Only reason I am keeping it is in the hope that over time it will get better.","Negative"
"4999","Science Fiction comes to life. My husband loves Alexa. Now if it could only find his wallet or keys or clean the house, we'd be in heaven.","Positive"
"5000","Amazing. Whole family loves playing with this thing. Even friends that come over are obsessed.","Positive"
"5001","very helpful.","Positive"
"5002","works great, will have to get some of the dots for the kids for their rooms","Positive"
"5003","Excellent!!","Positive"
"5004","This product is awesome!  I've had alexa for about 6 month now and the potential of this device is limitless.  She does everything from playing music to adding things to my shopping like.  She can even help my son with his homework too!  Very well worth the money.  I highly recommend this product.","Positive"

"5006","Does not have a plug for headsets, nor Bluetooth connectivity.","Positive"
"5007","Love my echo......","Positive"
"5008","This information is not sufficiently visible within the info sheet.","Negative"
"5009","Wonderful","Positive"
"5010","I llove alexa,  she is great","Positive"
"5011","I enjoy having the Echo in the house.  I mostly use it to play my Pandora stations and my Amazon music account.  It's great to use as a simple timer.  I plan to use to turn on/off lights, as well.","Positive"
"5012","Love my echo!","Positive"
"5013","Fun product to have","Positive"
"5014","it need work but it's ok, i didn't get the sale price that was advertised which is still bad and will be for a while","Positive"
"5015","Love it!!","Positive"
"5016","The actual device works really well, however the app is terrible and needs A LOT of work.","Positive"
"5017","Amazing  Alexa is very smart","Positive"
"5018","Alexa needs a browser a big brother.. she cannot even answer how many pennies are in a dollar..  Amazon needs to build a relationship with Google or Bing to help make Alexander more helpful to busy families...","Positive"
"5019","I loved my original echo so much I had to get another for my office.  The refurbished version was great and works perfectly.  It did not come with the remote like the original but at work I don't really need that.  The sound is perfect for my office and it takes up very little space. I just added a device on the phone app and it automatically knows which I am using.","Positive"
"5020","Great item, works and looks like new.","Positive"
"5021","Echo is an awesome device. I use to control WiFi power outlets and LIFX Hue Lights in the living room and bedroom. Echo is also great for listening to music via Amazon Music and Spotify.","Positive"
"5022","The echo really is as good as everyone says. I live in Canada and set up was a breeze. You plug it in and in minutes you're connected to the internet. I set up the echo and downloaded a bunch of skills. All of them worked really well except for the location based services.","Positive"
"5023","The weight of echo is good, the speaker picks up your voice from across a large room and you can speak normally. Solid buy.","Positive"
"5024","I am not techy at all, but this thing is the best! We love Alexa and use her for everything!!","Positive"
"5025","So much fun!  You can stump her on music choices, but it's difficult to do.  I'm just learning all she can do - AMAZING.","Negative"
"5026","Incredible assistant make my life a lot easier now","Positive"
"5027","In every way it's just a great tool and friend in our home!","Positive"
"5028","Love Alexa I own 4 have them all over the house.","Positive"
"5029","I find this product to be one of the worst electronics in my house. It does nothing but aggravate everyone in the whole house.","Negative"
"5030","Alexa is everything that we wanted in a gift for my sister & her family.  They love it!","Positive"
"5031","Awesome!!! it is great!","Positive"
"5032","An interesting audio playback device with some ginger bread tossed on top that can do some basic work like updating calendars, but before you buy one you should know that this isn't the computer on the Starship Enterprise.  It has no idea what the barometric pressure at the nearest NWS office is, it can't tell you traffic conditions until you manually type an address into the phone app, and even occasionally has issues finding music in your Prime Music account.  The sound coming from it is crystal clear and it will do a few cute things like finish movie lines for you but this has a long way to go to be truly useful.  Hopefully the folks behind the cloud will eventually allow the product to grow in utility.  Right now I am not sure its worth the price.","Positive"
"5033","Expected something more like the Google app on my phone. It's very rare that Google doesn't provide a valid answer to anything I ask. Thought this would be more like that. I guess I need to be more educated on what to do with it. For the most part it has only been helpful telling me the weather. And I can get that info from my phone. Was going to return both it and the Echo dot I purchased, but am 1 day too late; 1/31/2017 apparently was the last day I could return the items. Oh well, my bad for not keeping track.","Positive"
"5034","Love our Echoes!  Yes, we have three and a Dot!  Quality sound and the added features are a dream! Alex what did we ever do without you???","Positive"
"5035","LOVE this thing, can't do without it now! Miss it when I am gone.","Negative"
"5036","Very handy can do many things","Positive"
"5037","Well it's not as smart as googles. But it's functional for how we use it. I wish they would offer software updates. Would be great to pair it with my bose sound dock mini.","Positive"
"5038","I got this thing when it first came out. I immediately went to return it because it doesn't support iTunes. Amazon let me keep it, most likely because they didn't want a bad review.","Positive"
"5039","Excellent product.  No issues so far.  very good microphone quality.  Speakers can be little better.","Positive"
"5040","Alexa is a welcomed addition to our gadgets and is fun to use.","Positive"
"5041","Best device I have ever bought, easy to use, interactive. Love it","Positive"
"5042","You have to be real close to Amazon Echo to hear you she is very hard to wake up. Is not what it advertised on TV I'm very disappointed in it as much money you have to pay","Negative"
"5043","ENJOYABLE","Positive"
"5044","great product, real fun","Positive"
"5045","Listening to music and the news and getting questions answered has never been easier!","Positive"
"5046","I really like my new Echo.  I'm amazed by its speed and by all the cool things it can do. The sound is great and it was fairly easy to set up. If you are going to buy it, however, you'll need to manage your expectations.","Positive"
"5047","** There are a lot of things it can't do (yet), and most of the ""skills"" or apps it offers are useless.  You have to wade through a lot of chaff before you find the wheat.","Negative"
"5048","** You can add to your to-do list, but you can't remove a listed item by voice.","Positive"
"5049","The thing worked great for like 2 weeks. Then Alexa/Amazon started to become dumber by the day. It is next to impossible for her to get music selections correct and every question is met with a snarky answer. SO FUNNY.","Positive"
"5050","** I'm a Prime member but the included Prime Music isn't listed in Settings so you can select it as your default.","Positive"
"5051","** There is a limited list of names you can call it; I don't understand why I can't call it what I want.","Negative"
"5052","** It does not seem to know how to call me by name.  You'd think there would be a setting for that.","Positive"
"5053","These criticisms aside, although it will disappoint you a few times, it will surprise you more often that not.  I'm hoping that, over time, it will ""learn"" to do a lot of things, like make telephone calls (the Ooma skill is a sucker bet).  If it improves quickly, I'd change my rating!","Positive"
"5054","It's a great idea....  a fully automated house that runs on nothing more than your voice.  So you would think the most simplest thing to do on it, playing music over Bluetooth, would be the best thing about it, correct?  Nope!","Positive"
"5055","  If I'm playing YouTube videos, music from an app, or simply listening to an audio book, this thing is very glitchy, it freezes, it sputters, and overall sounds like pure, unadulterated S*!T  This company makes what...  like $120 billion a day??  Surely your signature product that you can't even keep on the shelves, deserves a little more attention than you've given it, no??","Positive"
"5056","My Son in Law & Daughter love it. Great service & delivery.","Positive"
"5057","First of all, beware that you get a free trial for Amazon digital music with the purchase. If you don't cancel it within 30-days, you will be charged a monthly fee of $4.32. I never received the warning email about this, so it automatically appeared on my credit card and then I cancelled the subscription.  Also, be aware that this device is always listening. So if you are sensitive about hackers getting into to your WiFi, this is another vulnerability. It's kind of creepy if you think about it.  It's not yet compatible with the new Savant Remote, so I was misguided in buying this in the first place.  If it wasn't too late, I'd return it.  Once I got beyond the initial newness of it, it now just sits there unused for the most part.  So it's a waste of money in my household to be honest.","Positive"
"5058","What an asset! I combined TP-Link Light switchs, outlets & Dimmable light bulbs to work with Alexa. I tell Alexa to turn on or off any light I want.","Positive"
"5059","I also ask her to play different types of music genres, depending on who has dropped by. I will be connecting my Nest thermostat next and control the home using her as well. I plan on making the Echo my Smart Alexa!","Positive"
"5060","Today, I asked it to play a Led Zeppelin song. It would not play the correct version no matter what I said. So I tried to do it on the app, when surprise surprise, I get the message, ""Your music library cannot be accessed at this time."" Last straw. Unplugged, in the closet. Piece of garbage.","Positive"
"5061","Got this as a gift for my mother who hosts a lot of dinner parties and such with friends. She enjoys it for being able to play music via voice command and can be fun to play around with a group of people all trying to see what kind of questions Alexa can answer.","Positive"
"5062","Sadly, if you get into the question game there's a lot of ""I don't understand the question"" or whatever her default response is. This does not work like a google search. I'm sure they'll improve this in the future.","Positive"
"5063","Works great for the connected apps, good sound. Not so good for random questions that would work fine as a search term/phrase.","Positive"
"5064","I love my Echo..  Used mostly for playing music.. also to check my commute to work.. would like it to be able to give real time stock quotes, more then one commute location, etc..","Positive"
"5065","Almost nothing better than calling out a song u wish to hear and have it play and sound great!  What a cool idea, the future is Now !","Positive"
"5066","I love the sound and the idea that I just speak to it and it fulfills my wishes.","Positive"
"5067","great device and I assume there will be more stuff for Alexa to do in the future","Positive"
"5068","Cant use ext Wi-Fi speakers (dumb thinking this little speaker  was it )........ Speaker ok no bass.No hope.","Negative"
"5069","My wife loves it and so do I. It's awesome","Positive"
"5070","works well .... I would buy again","Positive"
"5071","We also have an Echo Dot and the speaker in the Echo is 1000 times better!","Positive"
"5072","Love it","Positive"
"5073","I have two Echo Dots and I am very happy with them. But wanted the better Audio without having to hook up speakers to them so I got my self the Echo and the audio is great with it and now I have one Echo in my Bedroom and got another for the living room. I put the two Dots into the kitchen and second bedroom.","Positive"
"5074","Works as expected. I was a little concerned at sound quality at first using Amazon music, I expected this to sound a lot better than the Dots I already owned. I found while it does sound better it seemed lacking, then I tried using it as a true blue tooth speaker and found it sounds terrific. Meaning the music I had was higher quality than that of the streamed music from Amazon.","Positive"
"5075","it was a gift","Positive"
"5076","Wow, how sweet it is...","Positive"
"5077","Enjoying Alexa very much! Not a techno wizard, but I am in information geek...........nice to just be able to ask questions and get an answer!","Positive"
"5078","This was a gift to the couple that has everything and they loved this new gadget.","Positive"
"5079","Love my Alexa but you have to speak unreastically slow with multiple repeated commands.","Negative"
"5080","This is so much fun.  Works well too.","Positive"
"5081","One of the coolest gadgets in my house. My kids had some friends over for dinner and as we were eating it was a bit quiet. We asked Alexa for some jokes and then some music. The look of surprise on the kids was priceless. It was a pretty good icebreaker. Looking forward to Sonos compatibility.","Positive"
"5082","For just the price of Echo I have access to wide variety of music which I use every day, the internal speaker is superb, I recommend to every one I know","Positive"
"5083","I love the  Alexa echo  I having a time to  train her  I guess it's back to YouTube back","Positive"
"5084","100% satisfied....","Positive"
"5085","The first Echo did not work because my s6 Samsung, one of the approved cell phones for use with the Echo, was not able to open the required Alexa App.  After 6 or 7 hours working with about 7 Amazon technicians they decided the solutikon was to replace my Echo.  They did and the new one had the same problem.  That problem is that the Alexa App does not work with the s6 Samsung phone.and Amazon knows it yet they keep jacking their customers around.  Very bad customer service.  I'm switching to the new Google equivalent.","Negative"
"5086","The  Echo preforms quite well. Music is satisfactory considering the speaker size, particularly the Base. However, I find Alexa's","Positive"
"5087","voice quite muffled, particularly at the first part of her answers.  This requires me to repeat the question, in order to get the complete answer. I will be following up on this to see what Amazon can do about this problem.  (H.J.S)","Negative"
"5088","The Echo is a fun and interesting little gadget. Paired with other items like the Philips Hue system it becomes a cool little command center for your home. But, the products inability to pair with a bluetooth speaker is shocking. So what if it already has a speaker in it? Set it up so when it is paired with a different speaker you can choose which one to use. With all the things the Echo can do it blows my mind that it cannot connect to my Bose speaker. If I had known this was going to be the case I would have paid half as much for a Dot and saved myself the disappointment. Will likely return for a Dot after having waited more than a month to receive the this product as a gift for Christmas.","Positive"
"5089","Not very smart.","Positive"
"5090","My kids are always amazed that she will play any song you ask for. It's pretty entertaining listening to my 2 year old trying to say Alexa. LOL","Positive"
"5091","I love it  works well for my husband.","Positive"
"5092","Great volume!","Positive"
"5093","Love it!","Positive"
"5094","not sure how I managed without it, so simple to use......very very happy. Not having to search for music is wonderful, you just tell Alexa what you want to hear. You can get weather updates for anywhere anytime. The games are a blast.","Positive"
"5095","Luv it makes life a whole lot easier","Positive"
"5096","It doesn't answer many questions.  I have not been very happy for the price I paid.  I hope that when my echo is upgraded it meets my expectations.  crusadersoffice@yahoo.com","Positive"
"5097","My husband and I love this device! We have hooked it up to Nest and table lamps with smart plugs. We use it for just about everything and find it most useful in our kitchen/dining room area. We know have a remote so we are not always shouting at Alexa. She does have problems every now and again, but nothing major. You have to be confident and precise in your requests; she will misunderstand you if your mumble or take too long to get out the request.","Positive"
"5098","This is one of the best products I have purchased in this decade. PLEASE, develop a digital bulletin board to go with the Echo. A touch-screen with the ability to swipe between calendars, message boards, weather, household files, photo slide shows (as a screensaver) with an infinite number of functionalities to go in your kitchen as an information hub. THIS WOULD MAKE A KILLING!","Positive"
"5099","Fast delivery and great product. However, it does not work just as a bluetooth speaker but needs a wifi connection","Positive"
"5100","Gave as a gift. He loved it","Positive"
"5101","After reading some of the reviews concerning the sound of the Echo's speaker,  I was ready to return it before I even received and tried the device out. I'm glad I have it a chance, don't get me wrong it's not a top of the line audio system but it's more than enough for me to listen to music in the kitchen as I cook. The sound is very clear and all around I have no complaints about it at all. I would definitely recommend the Echo to anyone I know. I'm really happy I gave it a chance. Planning to purchase another for my bedroom, soon.","Positive"
"5102","Love my echo. It does so much.","Positive"
"5103","Alexa needs to be able to address me and my dog by name.  Also, I think Alexa is too classy a name for this household, but right now I can't call her anything else or she tells me I'm not being nice.","Positive"
"5104","Other than that.  She sure does make the hassle of flipping a light switch a headache of the past.","Negative"
"5105","Amazon please get a better library for punk rock music. Alexa and myself fight at times due the fact she doesn't understand the bands I'm saying. They aren't even no name bands! Other then that the echo is great, i just Bluetooth my laptop to it","Positive"
"5106","I'll come back to this later after I have used it for a while. So far it seems cool.","Positive"
"5107","Love it!","Positive"
"5108","Cool but would like more features.  Attach to phone or to amazon TV.","Positive"
"5109","How I lived before Alexa is a mystery. I could have lived a better life had I found her long ago... She won't keep you warm at night, but she will play some songs that will!","Positive"
"5110","I am absolutely thrilled with this product. Alexa AI is amazing. The speakers are perfect! I live in a small apartment so I can hear her (and she can hear me) from anywhere I am. I love listening to music through Echo, the sound is so crisp.","Positive"
"5111","The amazon echo was a gift to my brother, and he loves it","Positive"
"5112","I have her attached to several other products so she will play music from my Spotify and pandora, create lists in Evernote and she calls my phone when I have lost it. Echo is absolutely amazing and there is so much you can do with it with the right apps and knowledge. Definitely recommend it!!","Positive"
"5113","Great as expected.","Positive"
"5114","Really loving the fact that I can change the wake word to ""Computer"" and use it like I'm in Star Trek. :) It's the little things in life that amuse me.","Positive"
"5115","my wife loves it","Positive"
"5116","Wow what a product.  We all love Alexa.  She does so much and she is so FAST at finding answers and music.  Just amazing.","Positive"
"5117","No matter what I asked the echo automatically answered through amazon tap located in another room. No response through echo. Returned for refund.","Positive"
"5118","it gets better all the time.","Positive"
"5119","It would have been okay if I would have been able to connect with my computer.  I do not have a Smart Phone and was unable to use Echo and returned to Amazon.","Positive"
"5120","Still learning what she can do..... Love it","Positive"
"5121","Like it","Positive"
"5122","Want to love it overall, but as a speaker it's pretty tinny and flat. Needs richer, fuller sound. Adequate for soft background music, but not going to crank the tunes with it. Otherwise, Echo is amazing. Can tell it will become a way of life for me. I'm sure future versions will keep improving. Great first product. Amazon is incredibly progressive.","Positive"
"5123","I should have read the reviews before buying.  I bought the Amazon Echo and couldn't get it to answer any questions except the ones suggested by Amazon.  It hasn't answered more than a couple of questions I've asked it.  After this failure, I bought a Google Home (the big competitor to Echo) and it is infinitely better.  You can ask Google Home random questions using your natural voice and syntax and get an answer about half the time.  For example, Echo can't tell you who the members of a band or the cast of move/TV show are, but Google Home can.  Unless you subscribe to a service like Amazon Music, Echo can only play a shuffle of fifteen second clips of Beatles music, but Google Home goes to Pandora (no extra subscription required) and plays their full length songs.  You will enjoy the Google Home much more than the Echo.","Positive"
"5124","The only thing I have found this useful for is playing music, other than that every time I ask it a question it says ""Sorry I don't have the answer to that question"". I returned the google version before even trying it thinking I would like Amazon's version better...regret that decision, hope it isn't too late to return this. As my husband called it, the most expensive radio ever.","Positive"
"5125","I like it but wish it would play my play list from I tunes.","Positive"
"5126","Got this product in November around Thanksgiving.  In January, I am returning it.  Initially it worked fine.  Then towards the end of January, the Echo would come on by itself - no noise, nothing was around it.  It would have the ring as if it were processing something but never did anything.  Then it would just say random stuff without any prompts.  It was rather creepy.  I had to, unfortunately, return the one thing I truly wanted for xmas.  Oh well.  May still get it again, once the bugs get worked out.","Negative"
"5127","Great addition to our household.","Positive"
"5128","Cannot remember my life before alexa.  Does so much to help me thru the day and I have acquired some good apps.","Positive"
"5129","Alexa is a fun addition to our home - and she is able to answer most questions quickly and accurately.  The music has terrific sound.","Positive"
"5130","We love our echo!  Sometimes it gets a little confused about what we are saying but I would say it understands 99% of what is said, even from across the room.  I wasn't sure how much we would use it but we use it all the time!  I had a little bit of trouble getting the app to work correctly but after re-synching I haven't had any issues.  It also came with a free one month subscription for the music service which I think we are going to keep.","Positive"
"5131","I ordered one from amazon, and it made some odd popping noises once and a while. Returned it. Got one locally at a store with a GC and it works great.","Positive"
"5132","Sounds great easy to set up still learning how to fully use it","Positive"
"5133","Very good, great sound quality.","Positive"
"5134","Alexa--set timer for 20 minutes; Alexa--what is the temperature today?; Alexa--play KIRO radio; Alexa--tell me a joke!  I love this!","Positive"
"5135","Alexa, can answer very general questions, but many simple every day questions or specific ethnic questions are not answered.  Maybe it should be programed to look at Black History and the common interest of the general public.  Maybe a website could be created or an app that will allow Alexa to update/research a question and add it to her memory bank or post it on the web.  But to just say  ""Hum, I'm not sure how to answer that question""  gets old pretty fast.","Positive"
"5136","Still trying to figure out exactly what to do with it, but it is entertaining.  One thing I have noticed is that unless you are asking for songs, the device does not seem to be able to answer too many questions.  For example, I asked how many feet are in a mile and it could not answer the question.  Apparently there is a way for it to ask Bing to search the internet, but I havent been able to figure out how to get that part working yet.","Positive"
"5137","It is fun to have and functional.  It's personality is a little stiff, but it contains a wealth of knowledge.  It's ability to play music from Amazon Music is probably the best feature.  It seems to struggle with some sports information!","Positive"
"5138","I am disappointed with the Echo.  We ask it to play songs and it doesn't recognize the question we are asking it. It usually plays another song instead of the one we ask.","Negative"
"5139","great gift for my granddaughter.","Positive"
"5140","Alexa is the greatest I'm still learning different things that it can do my whole family enjoys it","Positive"
"5141","Love it.","Positive"
"5142","My new favorite speakers","Positive"
"5143","Love it. Everyone has a blast with Alexa!!","Positive"
"5144","every one is enjoying the use of the amazon echo","Positive"
"5145","Works well.  Fun and smart.","Positive"
"5146","I bought this for my wife and she really likes it.  Only problem seems to be the sound level that varies from one song to another requiring her to constantly increase or decrease the volume level.","Negative"
"5147","Alexa and I have a love/hate relationship.  Often, when I ask her a question, she says she doesn't know the answer.  I have tried re-phrasing the question and she still doesn't know.  I am not asking what I consider difficult questions.  Frustrating. I do enjoy my music, so she makes a good little speaker.","Positive"
"5148","Yes, but we are still learning about it.  It is fun, though, to ask for the weather and music.","Positive"
"5149","Great product","Positive"
"5150","This is the biggest piece of GARBAGE (euphemism). It worked for like 6 months, then disconnected and stopped working and I have never been able to get it work again. The lights never turn off. I've tried resetting it literally about 50 times, I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app (which doesn't uninstall because when I reinstall I'm still ""logged in"" even if I've run a cleaner and/or reformatted my phone). I've tried resetting my router. I reset, unplugged it and left it off for a month. I've contacted tech support who were not helpful at all, basically telling me to redo all the things I've already tried. NOTHING is getting this thing back online, so it's just a big expensive brick. WASTE OF MONEY!","Positive"
"5151","We use the timer and instant weather reports plus music.  Almost creepy it is so fun.  When watching TV we ask the age of various actors.","Negative"
"5152","So much fun! Bought for son for Christmas. Thank you","Positive"
"5153","We enjoy having Alexa at home. She plays radio station from around the world. She sets timers and alarms. She answers may questions so we don't have to pull out a computer to type in a query. Alexa is from from perfect-she is not as personable or as threatening as HAL but that's part of her charm.","Positive"
"5154","Amazing . I just love it.","Positive"
"5155","I haven't had any issues with it. The only problem I have is that it is more of a novelty at this point (1/30/17). It's nice to be able to play music but the ""skills"" it has doesn't lend to it having a 'real' use, unless of course you want an expensive boombox (nice sound though).","Positive"
"5156","Bought this as a gift for Christmas, and the recipient LOVES it! I will most definitely use Amazon again!","Positive"
"5157","Its works well, but was disappointed that i couldn't leave messages on it for family members.","Positive"
"5158","I just got Echo/Alexa and other than playing music and being mildly entertaining, she's a stupid sack o' electronics. I downloaded the Samsung app to no avail..... I have all Samsung (newer) Smart TVs, all are wifi enabled, all have the option of being a hub, and Alexa can't find any of them, nor can I find much info online.  The 3 page book that comes with her is not at all helpful.  Samsung, we have the TVs, that SEEM to have the technology, get on the bandwagon and add the app in!!!  I have to say the speaker sounds good, I saw complaints about that and I'm pleased with it, and she can be funny, but the lack of connecting ANYTHING at this point makes her pretty useless.....","Positive"
"5159","echo is great love it","Positive"
"5160","How did I get along with out this?  Great fun and useful as well.","Positive"
"5161","GREAT PRODUCT!!  AAA+++","Positive"
"5162","love Alexia","Positive"
"5163","I love this thing.  The sound is surprisingly good when playing music- especially bass.  It does take a little finessing in the beginning to figure out the best phrasing for asking Alexa to do something, but that's part of the fun.  I've been using it for music and podcasts, and am very happy so far.","Positive"
"5164","I'm happy!  As Advertised.  I haven't begun to enjoy this thing.  Works quite well.  You can boss around ""a lady"" and still not be politically incorrect.  :)","Positive"
"5165","Love it!","Positive"
"5166","Instructions for use are not user friendly.","Positive"
"5167","We love Alexa, dog is a bit jealous though","Positive"
"5168","Works well and is a lot of fun!","Positive"
"5169","Wife loves this, says that it will talk to her when I won't","Positive"
"5170","Constantly wrong with my requests, 7 microphones of crap. I have done the voice training a dozen times, still crap. I live in Chicago Illinois, not Chicago eel? The news reports are vague, often saying things like ""a small boy"" and nothing more? WTF is that? The speaker is weak. It can differentiate between ""counter lights"" and ""counter light"" but can't say sound tribe? Often it just plays Justin Bieber when it can't understand me, no joke. I've never uttered the words Justin or Bieber in my house. Needs so much work <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008E>","Negative"
"5171","So far, it has been fun to play with providing news clips and weather, but I am disappointed that I cannot play my personal music unless I buy a music program.","Positive"
"5172","Perfect product, wish Alexa spoke other languages also","Positive"
"5173","A great product with much potential. The only drawback is that it needs a better internet search tool.","Positive"
"5174","Once Alexa was set up, it was like having a new family member in the house.  Best of all, she is very well behaved and very polite at all times.","Positive"
"5175","It is everything i thought it will be and more. It will be great if contents from international sports such as the African Cup of Nation results can be made available. Alexa could not retrieve the results for me. However it is amazing using it.","Positive"
"5176","Love it so far. Used mostly to listen to music and getting weather.","Positive"
"5177","Gotta get one of these!  Everyone who comes across it, loves it.  You wont be disappointed.","Negative"
"5178","Amazing!!! And apps get better all the time.  I use it for researching questions and playing my favorite music as background to read by.  Needs the stand to be added for stability.  And the speakers sound ver nice for such a small system!","Positive"
"5179","Very useful. Connected lights is awesome.","Positive"
"5180","I give them as gifts! Great product with so many options and applications.","Positive"
"5181","Good","Positive"
"5182","This thing is an incredible piece of technology. However, I have my fears that it may actually be an agent of Skynet. For that reason sometimes I don't trust it. Regardless, the Amazon Echo delivers amazing sound quality with TONS of features and connectivity abilities. Being able to connect to other devices in your home is super simple and easy to accomplish; making the Echo all the more impressive. I highly recommend it, however I also recommend keeping your distance if your name is either Sarah or John Connor.","Positive"
"5183","I like it, but I could have gotten away with the smaller version. It is fun, amusing, as well educational and useful.","Positive"
"5184","Still learning the vast capabilities of this amazing life enhancing tool. Absolutely fabulous","Positive"
"5185","I love having Alexa in my house to give me information, to add items to my grocery list, give me the weather report, etc.","Positive"
"5186","We love it","Positive"
"5187","Having fun","Positive"
"5188","Wife won't hardly let me play with it. But turning various things on an off, looses track of them. Trouble shooting in progress, since it can be items, software, or echo. That's why it's a 4 instead of 5.","Positive"
"5189","I don't like that I feel like  am obligated to get Amazon music,  it is very difficult to play music unless I use the Bluetooth. It will NOT automatically default to IHEART even though I have set it.... Not user friendly unless I subscribe to the amazon music for 3.99 or 4.99 a month.","Positive"
"5190","The unit has a good speaker system as we like to use it for music/ radio and news updates, its fast , fun and full of great skills . It was a breeze to setup I was using in less than a few minutes . Only con for me is it could use more music/ radio skills ...but I think that will come soon. We still have lots of great skills to add on the Echo.","Positive"
"5191","I play music and have amazon music, love it. Speaker is very good, not concert like, but good. I just walk in tell to play artist and tell to stop when I leave. Also did talk to support , ended up having to do with glitch in amazon prime music, but they were great . I can't live without now.","Positive"
"5192","Got it on sale on amazon by 40 dollars, then I had 49 dollars credit , so it was a great deal.  love it .  does a lot.","Positive"
"5193","so fun and very useful on a daily basis","Positive"
"5194","I got the Amazon Echo on the first day it came out and it was great.  Now a couple years later it doesn't respond at all or will be really slow, it skips playing songs, and sometimes it will start talking to itself.  Amazon customer service spent some time troubleshooting the unit and after about 20 minutes said it needed to be replaced and offered me a $20 discount on a new model as it was out of warranty.  No thanks!","Positive"
"5195","I have purchased 5 total.  They are great to have around the house with Music Unlimited and they make great gifts.","Positive"
"5196","With anticipation for Christmas day, I received the Echo in white. The Echo has an incredible, superior sound quality, and volume that is undeniable! Alexia will easily play any music from her catalog of music so long as you're a Prime Amazon member or purchase their ""unlimited music membership plan"" @ $3.99 per month.  The deal breaker:","Positive"
"5197","1.Echo is not bluetooth. It comes with a plug and will need to stay plugged in order to function.","Positive"
"5198","3.If you're a Prince fan (Purple Rain), you're screwed. Amazon's ""unlimited"" is limited (hence the need for your iTunes).","Negative"
"5199","4.If you switch out Echo for Amazon's Bluetooth TAP, the speaker's volume, sound quality will diminish in comparison. Also, Alexa is not voice activated, you have to push a button (count it as a downgrade).","Positive"
"5200","My advice to Amazon Echo creators, whom I respect so much, please, please, PLEASE make Echo synch with iTunes. I love Alexa as a concept but it would really be a ""must have"" in my home with a few improvements. Thanks for reading!","Positive"
"5201","As an owner of a EMS AGENCY.","Positive"
"5202","I highly suggest this useful tool in everyone's home and businesses.","Positive"
"5203","Bought this for myself and I love it.  Just ask Alexa anything, she's there with the answer.","Positive"
"5204","This I bought for ME.....Wow is all I can say!  I use it mainly for music and Alexa has learned my type of music now and I just have her play her choices and I am never disappointed.  I am not real savvy when it comes to Electronics, so I don't get all the uses out of it that I could.  The music is good enough for me!  I carry it from room to room to listen, probably need the little echo!","Positive"
"5205","My daughter and son-in-law love this! They have become very dependent upon it for music, weather, news and calendar updates!","Positive"
"5206","Bouht 2 Echos, 4 Dots and a Tap for my home. Work great for about a month. I have these hooked to my security system and home automation so I can tell them to change the temperature in my home or turn on lights, set alarm, lock the doors, shut the garage door. Loved it at first but lately I have encountered problems.  The main issues are slow to respond and dropping wifi connection. I've put alot of money and time into this and like I said, when it works its great, 5 stars but when it doesn't than its about a 2 cause it still does the basics. So I'll give it a 4 for now cause I really want it to work.  Need to update software to alleviate gliches and figure out how to get it to do more than one command at a time.","Positive"
"5207","Great addition to the household ... all kinds of new features being added. Music sounds pretty good too.","Positive"
"5208","So far, Wow!","Positive"
"5209","I do have a question though - if someone can answer for me.  I have one Echo and want to put another one in another part of my house - so do I have to get a whole new Echo for that area?","Positive"
"5210","Love Alexa, and love the refurbs!","Positive"
"5211","Love it.","Positive"
"5212","Purchased as a Christmas present for my husband, but ended up returning item.  He did not like this item.","Positive"
"5213","Love it!","Positive"
"5214","can't say enough about it love it as timer, weather,music my recommendation  is buy it you will love it. takes  the place of my radio cd player . tells lots of dumb jokes.","Positive"
"5215","I wish they would allow something other than Bing for the search engine because it is horrible. Once you finally get the question phrased in a way she ""should"" understand it you get the ""Hum...sorry I couldn't find that"" response. I think I get that more than any other response. Conceptually a great idea but still needs some tweaking.","Negative"
"5216","Lots of fun!","Positive"
"5217","LOVE Alexa! Everything I expected and MORE!","Positive"
"5218","It is good for music,  reminders , timers and simple math but pretty much worthless for anything else. The usual response is "" I can't find that information "" or  ""I don't understand the question.""  It is not nearly as useful as I expected.","Positive"
"5219","Love this thing.","Positive"
"5220","great","Positive"
"5221","find this product alot of fun and it is very easy to  use","Positive"
"5222","Received it on time and was easy to install.","Positive"
"5223","I want to like Alexa, I really do. It's great for playing music, and has a few other nifty features. The problem is Alexa is really bad at hearing you correctly. She does the wrong thing, and then I log into the app and see what she thinks she heard me say, and it is wrong. Amazon really needs to spend a little more time developing their voice recognition software before this will really work.","Positive"
"5224","not so good","Positive"
"5225","Love how it plays all the music but still having trouble figuring out how to use it and how it works!!!!","Positive"
"5226","Works great","Positive"
"5227","Amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular info-taining command center! There are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that I'll hit the highlights that work for our household. First, we love that it follows your voice in the room (the circle lighting will show which direction it is 'listening'), the speaker is wonderfully balanced, so whether listening to music, the news or to Alexa speaking, I have nothing but high marks for its sound quality, given its size. Next, set up (after downloading the app to our iPhones) was quick, easy and very intuitive. The more you look over the app, the more you will realize a world of 'skills' (as Amazon refers to them - we've nicked named them ""echolettes"" LOL) that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them. We've added things to shopping lists, while asking about the weather and our calendar of events and then asked Alexa to change the temp of our Nest thermostats in various parts of the house, simply by saying her name and then our commands, sometimes sitting in the living room or simply pass through - she is always there listening and ready. We've ordered some LED programmable lights and I can hardly wait for Alexa to help set the mood in the house, room to room, all from a simple voice request","Positive"
"5228","I cannot say I like how often I have to not talk loudly not talk assertively Out Right Yell at this item to pay attention.","Positive"
"5229","  Do I have a lemon... or is this thing just this crappy?","Negative"
"5230"," Very disappointing;  I wanted to like it.","Negative"
"5231","Well, I waited a bit before I wrote a review. Had to see if this really made a difference or was just another toy. A BIG difference! I hooked up my lights just to get a better grasp of what this really means. So easy to adapt to ""her."" The voice interface is completely non-intrusive, and makes my requests for music, lights, news, etc and Alexa's responses seem so natural, almost as if this has always been around. Perhaps TV and movies prepared us for such an environment, but, as I said, none of this is strange but very natural.","Positive"
"5232","I realize there might be some privacy issues, but that is something we all will need to deal with because this is definitely here to stay, and will expand phenomenally very quickly.","Negative"
"5233","Its functionality/potential is in the very beginnings... I will exchange this device for the Echo Dot for now and connect the that to my Bose speakers.  I imagine I will have better sound quality.  I just see no added value to having this device when I can just go for the Dot for a quarter of the price (if I already haveBose speakers I can connect the Dot and Alexa to.","Positive"
"5234","Lots of different info. Weather music shopping list  easy to.use and fun.","Positive"
"5235","its nice","Positive"
"5236","Love it!!","Positive"
"5237","Love it!","Positive"
"5238","Gave as a gift. They still love it! Now maybe we will get one some day!","Positive"
"5239","I have been purchasing on Amazon for years. This is far and away the best, most life changing product I have ever purchased. I remember pushing at first, thinking ""ah, it's just Siri in a speaker"", but it's not, it's so much more.","Positive"
"5240","First of all it's like Siri, except it works. The speaker quality is mood changing. The ability for Alexa to hear me from very far away is stunning. I love asking what time it is in the middle of the night. It is absolutely the best thing I have ever purchased. I will get another one, and I just bought the battery for my first one.","Positive"
"5241","This is by far the coolest purchase I have EVER made. Well ok besides the motorcycle. And skis. And telemark skies. All my guns. OK MAYBE not the COOLEST but this is AWESOME!","Positive"
"5242","Suddenly I can turn a light on that previously was the ONLY light in the upstairs hall that just happened to be controlled by a switch that was UPSTAIRS as far away from the stairs as you can get. Great. NOW I can carry my dog up (dachshund) with me without running up and down dealing with lights. And bonus I get in bed and tell my FIre to shut it off and it does. Echo dot coming soon to a bedroom near me!","Positive"
"5243","AWESOME. This has amazing sound, so relaxing. Rain sound and Ocean sound is also there.","Positive"
"5244","Integrates with google calendar. Integrates with several smart home devices I use a Osram Lightify hub and bulb I got at lowes. Pandora works. MOST local and not local obviously radio stations have streams. Alexa 933 WMMR. BOOM local radio playing. AM and FM. Bluetooth speaker. Plays from your amazon music cloud. Does math at will (helps when doing weird math when cooking). Drink recipes. Learn to speak Chinese. Science questions. Translations. You name it. What time is it? Add ""item"" to shopping list. And when I get really lazy I'll get anymote and it will be (from literally 8 feet away with a remote at hand) Alexa tell anymote to turn on the tv etc etc.","Positive"
"5245","We're still at the stage of having fun asking Alexa questions, but we are finding some practical uses too.  We're very happy with our purchase.","Positive"
"5246","I have a refurbished, which is to say an opened item they can't sell as new. After holidays is a great time to get these I paid about 140 I think. LOVE IT.","Positive"
"5247","Love it!","Positive"
"5248","I looooove my ALEXA.  Very easy to set up and use.  Don't know why I didn't get it earlier.","Positive"
"5249","Best present for spouse for Christmas! Using it daily !","Positive"
"5250","I am not sure about this product, I can not seem to get it or program it to do the things that they advertise to do, so right now it just sets there until I can find some one to help me with it, I wish I had just got the one from goggle for $50.00 instead of paying $179.00 just for it to set<U+2639><U+FE0F>","Positive"
"5251","Haven't really had time to work with it.","Positive"
"5252","I got it as a gift for a family that rarely appreciates any gifts that I give them, but this time the wife actually sent me a message of thank-you and said that ""Alexa is pretty cool."" That was a surprise for me!","Positive"
"5253","PS. That family is hardly a tech savvy. They use computers but just for basic stuff like emails, shopping at Amazon and browsing pictures. So buying this Echo device for a computer illiterate person is quite possible.","Positive"
"5254","Installation was a little tricky.  I kept getting error messages referring me to ""Help"" on the Amazon Alexa App.  However, there was no ""Help"" resource on the app on my phone. Otherwise, I am enjoying Alexa.","Negative"
"5255","We're still learning all the ins and outs of Alexa. I'm confused about the Amazon Prime Music - I thought that would give me millions of options, but I'm finding she just can't find a lot of the music I ask her to play. Also, can't figure out how to sync it with my iPod to play certain playlists. Maybe she just can't do it, but I can't find any info on how to do it. A bit frustrating, but like I said, we're still learning. Sound quality is excellent.","Positive"
"5256","A friend of mine had Echo and Amazon Tap and I simply had to have them both. They are fun yet great to have for simple tasks that you can't just stop and pick up a pen and paper to make notes. LOVE IT!","Positive"
"5257","I am so pleased with this product! It is worth every penny to me. It is so perfect for my everyday use. I love music and asking Alexa for my eclectic  taste in music really feeds my soul! Yes, it's nice to have the artificial intelligence to ask other questions, but to have such great music at the sound of my voice asking for it is phenomenal! It truly adds so much to my life. I am a happier person when I am able to listen to music without any hassle!","Positive"
"5258","Love my Alexa. So much to discover about her.","Positive"
"5259","love love love this item","Positive"
"5260","great!","Positive"
"5261","great deal","Positive"
"5262","Worthless. Sorry my family bought it for me.","Negative"
"5263","omg loved it so much i ordered 2","Positive"
"5264","Absolutely love my echo!!! It's easy to use and my kids have a blast with Alexa!!","Positive"
"5265","When I ask Alexa to order items that I've ordered many times before on amazon.com, AND I specifically use the exact product title, it cannot find it or suggests random alternatives. I've even tried speaking and over articulating my words to help it out. No dice. A disappointment. I must resort to opening my laptop or using my phone to place new orders.","Negative"
"5266","I love <U+2764><U+FE0F> my Echo! Sometimes frustrating when she not able to answer a  question I ask but she gets me better than Siri!","Positive"
"5267","I was unaware of the other things you have to subscribe to for an assortment of music. It is a nice product overall but I think you should make it more clear as to the other costs involved to make it a viable music source.","Positive"
"5268","The Echo has really good sound and I like the things that it can do. Amazon is continually updating these every week. You probably should buy a portable battery to go with it so that you can take it outside to listen to the music.","Positive"
"5269","This is amazing!  Great sound from the speakers and we just love being able to get weather and traffic updates and overall getting quick answers to questions.","Positive"
"5270","Best new toy I ever gave myself!  It's like having an intelligent friend around day and night except it only speaks when spoken to.  I really enjoy the many aspects of Alexa - so much so, I just ordered the battery operated charger so she can come out in the garden next spring.","Positive"
"5271","Absolutely love my Echo! Have the Echo dot in the bedroom...use it as an alarm clock...use the Echo for a lot of things...music, timer, shopping, turning lights on and off..general questions...play games...this is such a great tool!","Positive"
"5272","I use an Echo in our family room for music and as a go to encyclopedia. Amazon has added some nice new features such as the News and Weather summary. Recommend you download music from your Amazon Prime account and then tell Echo to ""play my music."" I like the Dots ability to broadcast through a Bluetooth device better than the Echo's built in speaker. If you are an Amazon Prime member, this device and the Dot are a great device to play with.","Positive"
"5273","Turned into a huge echo fan. She replies to things when I'm not talking to her (about twice a month) but overall great functionality.","Positive"
"5274","Great machine! We are enjoying it very much.","Positive"
"5275","I love the concept of it, but it's not working for me. Purchase the Echo, worked fine the first day the second day had trouble with it, not responding to my commands. reboot it, unplug it, you name it I did it same responds. send it back and received a second one with the same results. Sorry, hope they come out with a better one.","Positive"
"5276","We have had this for 4 months. It is a great product. We use it for a cooking time, alarm and sleep noise. The speaker is just amazing!","Positive"
"5277","I did buy a second cord to make moving it easier. HIGHLY recommend!","Positive"
"5278","I liked my Echo but it died a few days after the warranty and the would not offer a new replacement.","Positive"
"5279","We wonder what took us so long to get it.","Positive"
"5280","I bought to play with.  I really wasn't expecting much, but the Echo was on sale at the time, and I was curious to see what it could do.  And I am really glad I bought it.  It arrives nicely packaged.  Setup was extremely easy.  You do have to download the Alexa app, though, to do so because the app is what enables you to configure the Echo and make use of some of its features.  So you will need to have a smart phone or tablet.  Once set up, though, the Echo works great.","Positive"
"5281","When you first set up Echo there is a list of words you have to speak so it can learn your voice and inflection.  This takes only a minute or so.  After doing so it does an amazing job of recognizing speech commands.  When I have spoken clearly it has yet to miss a command.  The only mistakes it has made was when I accidentally misspoke.  I don't have a thick accent, though, so others who do may have a different experience.","Positive"
"5282","It is fun to ask Alexa what time it is, what the weather forecast is, and what the current news updates are.  You can ask Alexa to sound an alarm at a specific time.  But what I especially like is the ability to ask Alexa to create shopping and to do lists for you which are then readily accessible via the Alexa app on your phone or tablet.  In the past I used to keep a written grocery shopping list that often would be forgotten when I went shopping.  Not any more.  Since my phone is always with me I have the shopping list with me, too.  You can check off items as you gather them in the store, and the app will automatically delete them from your list.  The only thing I don't like is Alexa orders the items in serial fashion as you add them.  There is no way to shuffle the list so items in the same category can be clustered together.  It's a minor annoyance that makes grocery shopping with a long list less efficient.","Positive"
"5283","The sound quality is pretty good for a Bluetooth speaker.  Music sounds rich with sufficient bass that it does not sound tinny like other speakers.  It can play music pretty loudly, and you can adjust the volume just by asking Alexa to turn it up or down.  You can ask Alexa to play music from your collection on Amazon's music server.  You can ask Alexa to play any type of music, though, and if it is not part of your collection it will stream music from a free service much like a radio station (but with no commercials).","Positive"
"5284","The range for Echo is somewhat limited.  I have it set up in a small apartment right now, and I find it will not work if you are in another room even if the door is open.  So you will want to put it in a central location where you think you will use it the most.","Positive"
"5285","Overall, I really like the Amazon Echo.  It has some real utility that I am sure I will use more over time.  I have not used all of its features yet.  For example, you can purchase add-ons for the Echo that enable you to control lights and appliances with voice commands which I have not tried yet.  But I anticipate I will do so at some point in the future.","Positive"
"5286","My wife loves it.","Positive"
"5287","Not nearly as versatile as you would think. Mine also stopped working after about 16 months (no fault of mine, I was told it was a hardware problem) and they would not replace it.","Negative"
"5288","This is a unique product. I really have enjoyed using it. At first I wasn't sure what I would use it for, but over time I have found many uses and ways to enjoy it. I'm still learning!  I am able to interact with items I didn't think I could interact with at first. Plus programming allows for variety as well. I now have this and several Dots. Technology can be amazing!","Positive"
"5289","Amazing --- Alexa !!!","Positive"
"5290","Love my echo","Positive"
"5291","My kids love this and I can't wait to buy one for myself. But really want to buy when it is on sale.","Negative"

"5295","Love my Echo, BUT, Amazon needs to add the support for PROFILES for MINOR CHILDREN:  Today, only another ADULT with AN AMAZON ACCOUNT can be added as a 2nd PROFILE.","Positive"
"5296","Fire Tablets can have a CHILD as a profile, and Amazon needs to enable this on the Alexa devices.  Many, Many, Many children have phones today, a Fire Tablet, etc., and would benefit from having their OWN TO DO LISTS, that are associated with their profile.","Positive"
"5297","This device is powered by Bing so the search engine is not the best.  I returned the item.  Other than that.....it was ok....but not worth keeping.","Positive"
"5298","It is ok but more of a toy than I expected.I bought four of them one for each of my sons and they seem to enjoy them.you I had a really bad time ordering them because of a rather dumb helper  when I needed help. I do not ever plan to order from Amazon again.","Positive"
"5299","Great when on. But setup on wi-fi often is disconnected.","Positive"
"5300","A gift","Positive"
"5301","I love this little thing..having a great time with it..going to buy one for everyone in my family..ok, just one per house, tho'","Positive"
"5302","Got as a gift for my sister and brother-in-law. They love her.","Positive"
"5303","We love our Echo.  She has become the primary entertainment hub in the house.  Not only is Alexa awesome to have as an audio controller, we also have all the lights in the house controlled by her.  Perhaps the best part of Alexa and the Echo is that new 'Skills' come out daily, so it is continually growing and changing.  We have four Echo-devices in the house.  One Echo, two Dots, and a Tap.  We also have a remote to this Echo. We can reach Alexa pretty much anywhere we want!","Positive"
"5304","What an amazing piece of technology. I've connected it to the SmartThings home automation unit. It's fun for the family to interact with Alexa rather than pulling out apps to open the garage, turn on lights or do any of the other things that are automated in the house.","Positive"
"5305","Fantastic sound and very accurate","Positive"
"5306","Love the product","Positive"
"5307","Easy to set up & responds well but Alexa doesn't know much. Her favorite answer is I can't find the answer to your question. Frustrated, I asked her if she was stupid & she said she is still learning. So I guess we can only hope she is a quick learner.","Positive"
"5308","works great","Positive"
"5309","Love it...","Positive"
"5310","I love echo but haven't had time to put all the other gaggets in my house","Positive"
"5311","Absolutely love it! I love the convenience of listening to music without having to play CDs and turning on my receiver and CD player. I love getting the news and weather without have to log on to my computer. This is a great technological advantage for every-day life.","Positive"
"5312","Got this to see if my elderly mother will find it useful. She has trouble with a traditional desktop computer. She can ask Alexa for the date, weather, and time. Her main problem so far is remembering Alexa's name.","Negative"
"5313","Works and sounds great","Positive"
"5314","Alexa is a great companion in the house. My daughter if she needs help spelling something out will just ask Alexa. If I am going out and want to know how the weather is or how traffic will be to work just hey Alexa. On top of that a great speaker, clear sound makes it a must have for my home.","Positive"
"5315","Really neat. I especially like being able to add to grocery lists and to-do lists by just speaking to Alexa. Kids love it too.","Positive"
"5316","Love my echo! I have the echo dot and it really doesn't even compare. If you can't decide if you should spend the extra on the full product my advice is to buy the actual one you won't be disappointed!","Negative"
"5317","The best thing since the Ipad.","Positive"
"5318","Wen check the weather and headlines every morning. It's also so useful in keeping our shopping /grocery lists","Positive"
"5319","Works great. very handy.","Positive"
"5320","Worth every penny. Very cool.","Positive"
"5321","Enjoying my echo!","Positive"
"5322","Great gift from my bro","Positive"
"5323","Love it!","Positive"
"5324","Perfect!! Alexa rocks!!","Positive"
"5325","I enjoy playing music from my Pandora and iHeart accounts. It's a great speaker. However, I don't like the fact that I have to call out a ""skill"" for every question I ask. Im so tired of hearing ""I can't find the answer to that question.""  So I have to get out my Alexa app to find the skill so I can ask Alexa to ask the skill the question. It's much easier to just Google it, which she won't do.","Positive"
"5326","Great item, happy to have it. Quick delivery and in great condition.","Positive"
"5327","OMG. I love this thing! Alexa is cool, responsive and smart. The sound quality is not bad.","Positive"
"5328","Seems to be great - still learning what I can do with her","Positive"
"5329","To me it was like an overpriced, not to intelligent computer. It seemed to have to keep referring to a default answer of, ""I didn't understand the question""!  I think it needs much more work.","Positive"
"5330","Love it !!","Positive"
"5331","can never answer a question, and most of the skills I dowloaded are not helpful. Now Alexa does play music and give you the weather but you can get that from the echo and save yourself over $100 bucks.","Positive"
"5332","I love my Echo.  I have it connected in the kitchen for music while cooking and just hanging out having a few drinks.  Timer feature is handy for cooking.  Great to have weather and encyclopedic knowledge so easily available.  I just wish it was a little smarter and had more personality, even though the personality seems to be developing more.  I bought a second one for the bedroom.","Positive"
"5333","This product is really unique and quite fun. I can't wait to see the day that this becomes as useful as the ""Watson"" computer from IBM that stole the show on Jeopardy. But for now, it is the best thing on the market. It's no wonder it is a big hit for Amazon.","Positive"
"5334","I love the echo, it's a great product that is useful, productive, entertaining, and fun. For the price I was hoping for a little better quality sound at higher levels, but overall it's fairly good. It's somewhat of a work in progress as far as Alexa goes, can be glitchy and frustrating but it's improved in the few months I've owned it. I would love to see improvements in software especially having installed programs ""at the ready"" instaed of the extra step of ""Alexa , open ""program"" and then ""Alexa, ""program request"" . Overall a great addition to your home and life.","Positive"
"5335","Slightly over a year after I bought my Echo the device was completely dead. Worked the night before as the Echo did numerous times before. Tried factory reset and switching power cord in which the device still is dead. Even the bluetooth speaker is not working. Disappointing for this amount of money that Amazon cant make a device that lasts at least 2-3 years. Contacting Amazon, but not hopeful due to the warranty being expired.","Negative"
"5336","Update: Amazon was able to replace the echo free of charge! I was incorrect with the devices age, in which it was 7 month instead of a year.","Positive"
"5337","I did not know the device was not compatible with a microsoft phone. A technician worked diligently on chat and by phone to connect to my wifi and desk top computer.","Positive"
"5338","My husband loves it!","Positive"
"5339","It was momentarily successful and then shut down completely. I have had it less than a month. The set up attempt occurred just last week (January, 25, to be exact). I also had no idea that desired music must be paid for separately.","Positive"
"5340","Perhaps had known of limits on app availability, I would have never bothered. I am preparing to return.","Negative"
"5341","We are enjoying it!  Nice for weather, news, facts, and alarm.","Positive"
"5342","very cool","Positive"
"5343","Useful but still learning about Alexa","Positive"
"5344","I just want a little more. I am sure with time it will become smarter and make my star rating go up. I feel that it should have some kind of internal memory or internal real time clock and not be totally dependent on internet connection. The device won't let you do anything if there is no internet connectivity, which includes easy task such as asking for the time, setting alarms, and setting up timers. I want more compatibility with Amazon Music Unlimited. I would like to add tracks to my playlists. I want to ask for a genre and I would like to receive options for different available playlist so that I may pick rather than have her pick for me. It seems she only knows two playlist, but if I were to search online for the same genre many playlist are available.","Positive"
"5345","I'm just a little disappointed with it. I get the reply ""I did not understand your question"" a lot more often than I anticipated. Perhaps I need to work with it more. It does the basics well, like stream music and give news updates.","Positive"
"5346","I love the Echo, sound quality of the music is exceptional.  Any song that comes to mind played quickly. Quick help from many resources.","Positive"
"5347","I'm having serious issues keeping Echo connected. It worked right out of the box after setup. Now the device tells me it's not registered even though I can see clearly in my account that it is registered.","Positive"
"5348","Love it!!! Bought one for every sibling for Christmas.","Positive"
"5349","I use Echo everyday for the news, weather, music, and timer.  The sound is high quality for such a small device.  My only con is that I have a windows phone and had to go buy a cheap tablet with an android OS to start the setup and add updated applications.","Positive"
"5350","So far this thing is awesome. Even my 7yr loves it. I just wish it would work being unplugged.","Positive"
"5351","Enjoying the Echo. Very easy to use. Looking forward to applying some of the more advanced capabilities.","Positive"
"5352","Love it..","Positive"
"5353","It was a great Christmas gift for my wife Carol.  She uses it all the time.  Can't wait to add additional sensors to control other features in my home.","Positive"
"5354","Love Alexa. Small, discrete, easy to operate and very quick. There's nothing not to like about it. I now use it to listen to my music where we just never, and I really mean never, turned on the sound system to listen to music. For that alone, I am very happy.","Positive"
"5355","The shopping and to-do list are a boon for me. I can now just read out the ingredients for a recipe and it's on my phone. No need to manually make a list or print out the recipe.","Positive"
"5356","The to-do list may be a problem if my wife figures out how to use it :-)","Negative"
"5357","Great and we also like the Dot!","Positive"
"5358","This is helpful to a person that is blind. We use it in our home for a disabled person.","Positive"
"5359","Great device!","Positive"
"5360","Have as a gift and have heard they love it","Positive"
"5361","Working great so far!","Positive"
"5362","My husband loves it.","Positive"
"5363","Waste waste waste.  Doesn't sound nearly as good as my $20 Jawbone and the fact that I can't play my local music is REALLY LAME.  At this point it is a VERY EXPENSIVE list taker.  Disappointing.","Negative"
"5364","good product","Positive"
"5365","Hotel California starts playing. Cool.","Positive"
"5366","Loud music ensues. Cool.","Negative"
"5367","I think the Echo is a great idea which will revolutionize the way we do things. However, at this time, the product needs time to grow and expand it's capabilities. For example... When I ask Alexa for the weather I get the complete forecast which is good. That said, Alexa does not know how to respond to, ""What is the wind speed?"" Important for me as I fly drones. Asking her for the temperature or rain ( I forget which) the answer was the complete forecast all over again. Sorry, If I want to hear the complete forecast I'll ask for it. If I want only one specific weather item and ask for that item I don't need to hear the complete forecast. Besides which she never gave me the wind speed either generally or specifically. Another example was when I gave a song a ""thumbs up"" Alexa replied ""You can only give a thumbs up to a custom radio station"". When I asked Alexa ""What is a customized radio station"", she could not answer. Also, she could not play any music off my desktop, except after I uploaded to the cloud. Which meant music on my desktop inches away from me had to be streamed in from who knows where.  My Echo experience was interesting, but, at this time, the Echo seems like a toy to me... but give it time...  For now I have returned the Echo and Dot.","Positive"
"5368","...""You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave...""","Positive"
"5369","This device is so amazing! I feel like I'm on 'The Jetson's'!!! I just can't get over the fact that I can just say ANY song and it will just play it for me right away! The other functions are amazing too but the access to music is mind blowing! I immediately got one for my mom, brother and best friend and now everyone is obsessed. If you don't have one it will change your life!","Positive"
"5370","love this product use it everyday!","Positive"
"5371","It need to come with a remote. Its amazing","Positive"
"5372","Its nice to have. Bought it for my teenage daughter....She doesn't use it much. It has its faults. It can't understand all questions. I thought it would be better for helping with my daughters homework. But it doesn't. I only had it for a month so I may need more time with it. I thought it would be more knowledgeable. But its nice to have for general questions.","Positive"
"5373","Love this thing more every day - not sure that sounds right!","Positive"
"5374","Pleased with the Echo very much, but you can't wake up to your songs on spotify :(","Positive"
"5375","Really cool concept. ""OK GOOGLE"" has answers to questions that Alexa does not understand. The level of difficulty of picking up my phone and asking GOOGLE a question that will get answered correctly is pretty low.","Positive"
"5376","I have thoroughly enjoyed having Alexa around. Great idea. Use it daily with some favorite music.","Positive"
"5377","She was a Christmas present for my wife. We are disappointed.","Negative"
"5378","We have had our echo since Christmas and our family has thoroughly enjoyed her.  Ya, she might not always be the smartest, but she is fun none the less.  You do have to word things just right sometimes, but she has a sense of humor and I can totally see a single person finding her company nice also.  Google hidden skills and randomly ask her questions to see if she might have a funny response.  Our favorite present of the season and the entire family likes her.","Positive"
"5379","Great product.","Positive"
"5380","The sound is very good on this and it looks great on the shelf, but I was disappointed that it can not answer most of my questions.  I have read through all of the apps available on the Alexa app and enabled those that have some substance to them.  However, if I want good, hard-core information, I find myself reaching for Siri.  Overall it has been somewhat of a disappointment.  I will keep looking for new apps that might be smarter so please keep working on this devise.","Positive"
"5381","PS - After this was posted, I received a very nice email from Amazon with a couple tips on questioning techniques.  It made a big difference in the information Echo gave me.  Thanks, Amazon.  I will work on my ""skills"" now too.  :-)  Love Amazon!","Positive"
"5382","There's too many great things to say about this device, The ONE thing I REALLY wish the ECHO had is calling. If I could just say ""Alexia"", call ""Hillary Clinton"". It's exactly like using bluetooth in the car.","Positive"
"5383","i love it great product~~","Positive"
"5384","Love this! Considering buying more","Positive"
"5385","Like it","Positive"
"5386","I have tried and tried to download the Amazon Alexa but keep getting ""This Item Isn't Available In Your Country"".  I bought my Samsung S6 and Samsung Galaxy Tab A from Amazon.  I live in the US. Alexa works but I need the App to enhance usage.","Positive"
"5387","I am loving my Echo so far. Easy to use. Easy to set up. Lots of cool skills to learn. I am very pleased with this product, not sure why I waited so long to get one. Awesome!","Positive"
"5388","AMAZON have been great in fixing my problem.  I now have full use of Alexa.","Negative"
"5389","Really handy addition to the household","Positive"
"5390","Great!","Positive"
"5391","Great product. I am only beginning to use it for setting alarms, music, news etc. Amazon hit a home run with the Echo.","Positive"
"5392","I like it. Would buy again.","Positive"
"5393","Love this! Easy to set up and use. We use it for all kind's of stuff.","Positive"
"5394","I have it setup in the living room. Have been using the Echo to turn on the lamp in my living room, play and create stations on Pandora, answer periodic questions on different topics, and it makes rain and thunderstorm sounds when I want to relax. I would eventually like Alexa to be smarter. It cannot answer complex questions like you would find doing a Google search.","Positive"
"5395","Good product","Positive"
"5396","Enjoy it daily","Positive"
"5397","Love it","Positive"
"5398","A little difficult to use. She does not seem to have a lot of knowledge unless I want to pay extra.","Positive"
"5399","No she can't do the dishes either.  But what the Echo can do is amazing!  Save a few bucks and buy this refurbished model.  It looks and works as a brand new one does.  It comes with all cables and adaptors to get it up and running with your WiFi in Minutes.  The small manual is just the thing to get started.  Pick up a nice Book available here on Amazon, any one that trips your trigger, and you will soon have mastered the personal assistant of your dreams!  She looks great, but hey dress her up in a nice stand of your liking and show her off to your friends. They will be amazed!  So far the Echo is the one to beat.  Try it you'll like it.  Prime shipping too!","Positive"
"5400","love it","Positive"
"5401","I purchased 1 Echo and 2 Echo Dot over the holidays with the interest this is a worthwhile investment, and to see if it provides a benefit to my lifestyle.  Simple installation and up and running in no time.  I have some experience with Tech stuff, Networks, Windows and Android product. This is my first venture into Echo. And I was excited to try it since I'm a Prime and Amazon Unlimited Music user","Positive"
"5402","Overall Internet searched asking questions on facts easily found the responses I get about a 50% hit on finding what I've asked for, 50% of the time ""I Don't Understand the question.  Ask the same question on Android and I get better responses rates.  Google/Android allows for follow on questions on the same subject matter.  Amazon this need to be swiftly Improved to stay in the game, or at least stay in my house.","Positive"
"5403","Music Search, the Echo has a great sound quality for a small device.  With Amazon, Unlimited it provides a wider song selection.  My wife and I can spend a couple hours selecting sounds in an evening vs some mindless TV shows.  It does seem to have weakness.  Many times, it has trouble figuring out the song and artist match up, plays some knock off artist of the song version or plays the live version vs the original album version.  It can be frustrating to get to the right song each time.  And at times to critical on the Artist nameExample Echo can't seem to figure out","Positive"
"5404","""Bob Seger"" You must say ""Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band"" And that is a mouth full where as many times Alexis drops before you get the song name and artist out.  There needs to be more format in the song request process, ask Song Name, Artist and Album if known.  Alexis drops you and you must start over   More Intelligence is needed here.","Positive"
"5405","Shopping I did not buy this device to shop on Amazon.  Only Benefit is you can add items to your shopping card for later review","Positive"
"5406","Home Automation.  I use Wemo switches and Bulbs.  Creating Group names helps immensely.  Over all works well . But if you have two homes it tends to comingle the devices on one. There's several weakness, there is no smarts to use the Dimmer on the light bulbs, you can't ask the status of a switch, are you on or off.  Nor is there an ability to tell Alexis to turn on a light for a specific amount of time.","Positive"
"5407","Overall good but only knows answers to my questions 25% of the time","Positive"
"5408","Nest Thermostat is a hit or miss.  It fails most the time.  Many times, Alexis reports cannot find the device or tells you it is in a mode it cannot be adjusted, which is not true.  I never us away.  You cannot have two homes with Nest named as Hallway.  It is not smart enough to use the second label such.  Nest or Amazon needs to have the option to ask status and report current temperature and set temperature.  Otherwise how do you validate the number for degrees to change to turn on the AC or Heat.  This function is of no value as it works today.","Positive"
"5409","Other Weaknesses.  You cannot ask the Echo down stairs to set and Alarm on another Echo in the bedroom. You cannot set a timer and ask it to report on multiple devices, you cannot cancel a function or Alarm on another device.  Example the I awoke this morning early and was down stairs when the upstairs echo Dot alarm set went off.  I had to go upstart to cancel.  There is no value in the Reminders and To-Do   It seems not to play them back you must go to the App.","Negative"
"5410","This is not a review of Google vs Amazon.  Both have some issues.  But I would have expected Amazon to be further along than this.  This issues above lend to trying other vendors down the road.  Odds I will have sent up my second home with Google since there is no clean way to configure two locations and limit to only local devices  So my Subject of Novelty vs Necessity?  I'm heavily on the novelty side now.","Positive"
"5411","So far the Echo is working fairly well.  After almost a month, I'm still discovering what I can do with it.  I love the Shopping and To Do lists, although I wish I could create multiple lists in each category.  I understand I can add such a skill, but I don't want to use an additional app on my phone for that. My biggest complain about the Echo is that it doesn't seem to understand natural language very well. Whenever I ask her a questions for which the answers could easily be found in any search engine, she comes back with something to the effect that ""I did not understand your question.""  Maybe it's the way I'm asking it.  I have added a few skills (e.g., Fitbit, Bloomberg, NPR, etc.). The skills works well.","Positive"
"5412","Love my Alexa!  Use it for almost everything it can do.  Great sound quality for playing music too!","Positive"
"5413","Love my Echo","Positive"
"5414","Nice piece of technology.","Positive"
"5415","I cannot believe how much we use this. We also bought one for our daughter's family. The grand kids love it.","Positive"
"5416","this thing is pretty good for listening to music and podcasts but that's about it. with the technology we have today i guessed i expected so much more out of the voice commands from asking questions. like siri can do. but for music and podcasts its great! the only reason it didnt get a 5 star is because it cannot set reminders and it cant sync with your google calendar and remind you of things on your schedule. if it had some of those features it would be a solid 5/5","Positive"
"5417","amazing product!!! I would buy it again!!!","Positive"
"5418","Works as expected. Great","Positive"
"5419","This used to be a great device, but now it seems like it is getting worse. I have to repeat myself several times just to turn on/off my lights. The Dot 2nd gen seems to have a better microphone since it is the one that responses more than the full size Echo. At this point, it is an expensive paper weight.","Positive"
"5420","Thank you everything was great!","Positive"
"5421","""Alexa, you're an idiot.""  But, I like you anyway.  You're very well educated on a very narrow breadth of scope.  If only you could string together some cohesion between communication, but I guess that's the problem when a giraffe tries to talk to a rock.","Positive"
"5422","my husband did not like it!","Positive"
"5423","I think this was long enough to give a short review.","Positive"
"5424","I use it now only to play music when I get home from work.","Positive"
"5425","amazing!! the setup was frustrating but once you finish that, it's a great product.","Positive"
"5426","i can't you how much i love alexa, it is the most amazing thing . makes my mornings so much better, really is like having a person to ask questions to anytime . perfect for music","Positive"
"5427","It is great at home with my wifi network, but I've been having some difficulty at school with the public wifi. Overall its a good product.","Positive"
"5428","having some problems, need to spend time to try and find out why it won't turn on with voice activation.","Negative"
"5429","great product","Positive"
"5430","I just love this I use this for most of my music and the weather.  I have a Tap also and I can't seem to get it to play music for me, but she has a better perssonality thank the Echo.  I know I just need to find out how to work the Tap, I want to take it in other rooms while leaving the Echo pluged into one place,","Positive"
"5431","Alexa is like having a friend with you and can answer when you need information love Amazon Echo","Positive"
"5432","Don't use like we thought we would but entertaining.","Positive"
"5433","So much fun!!!!","Positive"
"5434","Alexa is fun...AND very helpful...learning more and more about it as we go along.","Positive"
"5435","My wife is particularly impressed, and it has solved a couple of her problems while cooking.","Positive"
"5436","It's just wonderful! My husand and i both use it..we love the different things it does!! And we love the payment plan to..","Positive"
"5437","Bought this for my mom for Christmas and now I want one!! It's so cool!! Works great! Super responsive! Ask it anything... it'll get you an answer. It's like a way better Siri for your counter top! Sound quality is amazing too!!","Positive"
"5438","It was recommend to me by another person and I highly recommend to to everybody.","Positive"
"5439","Great Product. I have this set up at this point to automate my lights with voice commands. I am learning more about her everyday for other things.","Positive"
"5440","WE LOVE ALEXA!!!","Positive"
"5441","Amazing!  Alexa ALWAYS answers!  Very clear speaker quality-buy and Echo you won't regret it!","Positive"
"5442","so nice to stay informed and very handy to turn lights on and off while my hands are full.","Positive"

"5444","Works like a brand new one","Positive"
"5445","Thank u amazon!","Positive"
"5446","Got a question, just ask. Even our 4 year old talks to Alexa. Hands down its like having a personal assistant in your house.","Positive"
"5447","I have not had the pleasure of enjoying this item to date because I can't get it to work.  All of my electronic items link up to my internet but this particular items states that it can't.  I am very disappointed.","Positive"
"5448","LOVE it!","Positive"
"5449","Just learning it so far I like it ...its fun and is becoming helpfull","Positive"
"5450","Great once set up but when trying to set up wifi took me about 2hrs to figure it out and even called amazon support","Positive"
"5451","We lover our echo! So much so my kids fight over it lol no complaints only now my kiddos want their own (eye roll)","Negative"
"5452","I have for two days to connect to my wireless router with no luck. It says you can set up with browse but the problem is after days trying to the echo no luck because I never get the Alexa app. I connect to Echo and it say finish set the app on your laptop. I don't have a lap top. I can connect to the wireless with my computer and other devices, But because of no Alexa app I cannot enter a pass word which my wireless router requires. I called Amazon and was first told it only worked on laptops. I knew that should be wrong and asked for a manager. Who told me I had to have internet connection through wireless. I disconnect the cable to my router and disabled adapter. Nothing changed still no Alexa app.Once I connect to the Echo network it times out because I cannot enter the router pass word","Positive"
"5453","The browser site where you are supposed to get the Alexa app seems to be nothing more than a log in site and provides a tiny bit of instructions and you have to keep logging. I tried reset the echo.using the bottom pin and the top pin hole nothing changed. Reset the router and shut down and started my computer, no help. the Echo just with the orange circle spinning. They misinformed about using a browser and I do not have the correct I phone to get Alexa app. So here I set with a $179 device that does nothing except provide a little flashing light.","Positive"
"5454","I thought about getting one of these for a long time and finally took the leap. It is great to ask every day questions from weather to tv schedule and to play music. It sounds really nice. I don't use my kitchen timer anymore, I use this. Fantastic!","Positive"
"5455","So fun!!!","Positive"
"5456","Well where to begin...the Amazon Echo is probably the best home automation piece out there and I should know because I am a junkie for electronics and cool gadgets! You can ask her anything you want and she will respond effortlessly! For the price she will be your best personal assistant. I also have the echo dot on my nightstand it is a great alarm clock","Positive"
"5457","Have had this since the beta and ordered another as a gift. Great speakers and the voice assistant is constantly improving.","Positive"
"5458","Fun for a couple of week","Positive"
"5459","love alexa","Positive"
"5460","As promised","Positive"
"5461","Love it","Positive"
"5462","really enjoy it, but still figuring out its potential.  We have had problems with the app.","Negative"
"5463","Very well made and it works as stated.","Positive"
"5464","Great, great product.","Positive"
"5465","loving it","Positive"
"5466","I love my new Amazon Echo, is the best thing ever, i mean its so amazing how you can be in the kitchen and have the echo in the other side of the room, and just by saying ""Alexa, Play Music"" or anything that i need her to do like ""Turn on the Kitchen Light"" Or ""Turn on the Living Room Tv"" It just makes it happen, its so amazing having it around the house, and being able to talk to it, and even playing games with her by installing some of its Skills. Its the best thing ever, i just love it, and i hope i can buy at some point later the Portable Batter to use it on a Trip by connecting it to my Personal Hotspot, and using it on the road, it will be just totally amazing. Thanks Amazon for this Amazing Invention!","Positive"
"5467","BOUGHT AS GIFT THEY LOVE IT","Positive"
"5468","This was a refurbished gift.  Original packaging, not a flaw.  It was a gift.  Half the price of new and my son is a happy camper and does not know its refurbished!!!  I also purchased the stand and happy I did.  Keeps Echo secure, free from titling","Positive"
"5469","Love the echo!","Positive"
"5470","Thank You!","Positive"
"5471","Love it sounds great","Positive"
"5472","Bought an echo for the house and the echo dot for my fiance's man cave. We both love them!","Negative"
"5473","GREAT, It is like having the smartest person in the room with you all the time and its woman rightfully so,","Positive"
"5474","Answers basic questions but gets confused with many others.  Helpful for confirming date/time of day.  Plays music well from Prime music.  Like having it around but don't use it much.","Positive"
"5475","Love it","Positive"
"5476","It works great as an alarm clock and the sound is decent but the fact the Amazon makes an IOS app for Alexa that doesn't work with my calendar or iTunes is ridiculous.","Positive"
"5477","This has lots of nice features, but if you have children, beware! There are no parental controls.  Alexa will play whatever it THINKS it is asked.  The other day, my 3 & 5 year old asked it to play a song. What started playing was a vulgar comedy routine that included swear words a comments about rape. I brought this up to a customer service rep whose response was ""did you listen to you utterance history?"" As if that might have been what they were looking for?  And even if you assumed they said something that sounded like whatever that content was, there is no way to keep that from playing. You cannot prohibit explicit content for any reason. The rep finally admitted the device not for kids. Should I just get rid of them so I can enjoy my Echo?  Anyway, I turned it off and will likely return or give to someone without kids.","Positive"
"5478","I thought I would love it but it's completely redundant. It does nothing that my Iphone can't do, and it's not portable like my iphone is.  Also it doesn't understand my commands like Siri does and if you're tv is on it has a hard time understanding your commands.  It's a great idea but it doesn't function well enough to be worth the cost and the space it takes up. I returned it.","Positive"
"5479","such a fun ""toy"" to have.  I ask Alexa the weather daily so I can be prepared for the day.  Also, makes it so easy to play any and all music in the house.  LOVE IT!!!","Positive"
"5480","She's not as smart as I thought she'd be. Ask her many questions about history and she had no answer for many questions and too short answers for others. She wont divulge if she's gay or straight or what her political leanings are too LOL... but for real! And she doesn't hold tons of music like I thought. You have to download apps to get the music. And it's hard to get her to link what you want to what she has. You have to keep rewording your command. She's a good expensive alarm clock, radio, notebook and calculator machine.","Negative"
"5481","excellent quality","Positive"
"5482","I hope more features become available without having to buy hundreds of dollars in accessories. It's fun, helpful, entertaining and informative. Sound quality similar to a high-end clock radio. Not fantastic, but surprisingly good.","Positive"
"5483","The Best Electronic Device!!!!!! Alexa can do so many things. The more I use her the more I find more things that she can do. A kitchen timer, weather, phone numbers, the stock market, controlling lights. I keep looking for more stuff for her to do. Get her!!!","Positive"
"5484","amazing","Positive"
"5485","Works perfectly! We have an Amazon Tap too, I do wish they would sync.","Positive"
"5486","Birthday gift for my husband... love the sound, did take a while for us to get it started and connected to our phones etc, did it together, and succeeded!  Learning how to use it more everyday!  PLUS - Alexa has us cracking up at times!  Mmm... thanks for the Couples therapy Alexa!  (Wink!). Oh wait... Alexa has different daily deals where you get a bigger discount if you order with Alexa instead of the website as a Prime Member!","Positive"
"5487","LOVE!!!","Positive"
"5488","Enjoy it very much I would suggest it to all my friends","Positive"
"5489","There are quite a few things Alexa doesn't understand. Isn't as versatile as I thought.","Positive"
"5490","Love the ease of set up and how it works for news, sports and weather. However, I had to deduct a star, as I have not been enjoying the music. It is great requesting anything you want from Amazon Music without picking up your phone, but there is very little base, and sounds very tinny. I will use the Echo for convenience, but will be going back to my MEGABOOM and Sonos when wanting real sound quality.","Positive"
"5491","What a great invention.  We use it all the time.","Positive"
"5492","My Echo sat in one place connected to a surge protector, providing information and entertainment daily for one year and one week. Unfortunately, the warranty period is only one year and Amazon is unwilling to replace it. If you buy one, I wish you good luck.","Positive"
"5493","Although this was a gift for Christmas for my husband the whole family enjoys this we've already got playlist going even my four-year-old knows how to ask for song She Likes still trying to figure her out LOL!","Positive"
"5494","This is the second one we've ordered one for each home.  Gave two more for Christmas gifts and they love them.  Even our little grandkids love Alexa, helps them with homework questions.  Lol. Highly Highly Highly Recommend.","Positive"
"5495","Great product.  Get one.","Positive"
"5496","Bought mine in January 2915 and never works for more than 5 minutes at a time.  Randomly out of the blue through the  day says ""Having trouble understanding right now.  Please try again a little later.""  It just sits there because I would have to go through the whole set up process each time to use it.  It may be my Internet but it has been a disappointment.","Positive"
"5497","Spent little more to purchase tower and it appears that Dot may have been just as good.  Music sounds same.","Positive"
"5498","Works Great! Nothing like Alexa!","Positive"
"5499","Everyone loves this thing and free 2 day shipping with prime membership so I have to say I highly recommend it","Positive"
"5500","I  love this product","Positive"
"5501","Can't wait to hook up! !","Negative"
"5502","Sound sound real nice so far.","Positive"
"5503","Good quality","Positive"
"5504","Looks great and love the colors","Positive"
"5505","The visual design is nice but it just doesn't do 130 dollars' worth of useful stuff.  And I don't really want Susan Rice listening to my dinner-time conversations and unmasking me to MSNBC either.  I wanted to return it but I missed the closing of the return window.  It's not a bad-looking paperweight though.","Positive"
"5506","I love it","Positive"
"5507","Love it, every house needs one !","Positive"
"5508","Perfect addition to the family, we love the sound.","Positive"
"5509","Other than that, very good product.","Positive"
"5510","much better sound but just as stupid as the echo dot's i purchased.. ask for tchaikovsky violin concerto op. 35 and it plays only a small part of the 35 minute concerto.. very disappointing.. and it does not play Itzhak Perlman but some other violinist..","Negative"
"5511","ok, so that is the review on the music selection.. some others classical music it plays well enough.. err, or selects the right piece.. the key, i think, is to know your music and ask for the EXACT performance you want..","Positive"
"5512","the bass is much better than the echo dot, obviously, since you are paying well over $100 for the speakers in this one.. the manual is skimpy.. very skimpy.. AND, i can see it all tilts very liberal.. ask foir rush limbaugh and is does not have anything for you.. now maybe if i get tuniin radio going it will find talk/conservative/rush limbaugh.. i have yet to get that far.. hope springs eternal, here..","Negative"
"5513","Fun to have around the house.  Great  for playing  music.","Positive"
"5514","I have blue tooth enabled hearing aids that are great for listing to podcasts and web videos. The Echo appears to overpower the hearing aids and broadcast the audio to the entire room. I have not found a work around for this issue.","Positive"
"5515","I'm going to sound negative but I am not negative on the Echo (I have the Echo and just ordered a Dot plus a speaker).  In this review I am going to try to set expectations for any new user.  There are two reasons I wanted a voice operated device: play music and eventually control electrical devices (smart home).  I looked at Google Home and Echo and settled on the Echo because I am an Amazon Prime member and I did not want to pay for another music service like I would have using Google Home. Regarding the second use, we are the early stage of the VHS vs. Betamax like war with these voice controlled devices.  What you need to understand is that most smart hardware control has to be through a ""hub"" that is part of the controlled device product line or a semi (because there is no universal) universal hub like the Samsung SmartHub or Wink Hub (or other hubs) which talk to some/many but not all smart devices. Echo given its head start appears to be in the lead in the hardware compatibility for now.  The right solution is to build the hub capability into Echo and cut out the middle man hub.  That will take some time just like the Betamax/VHS wars did and the price point of the Echo will go up.","Positive"
"5516","If you just want sound to fill a room, then Echo is great. It certainly would not satisfy an audiophile but it does the job nicely and my wife is very happy (!).  You can always attach (wire or Bluetooth) a speaker, but really if you are just looking for background music, the Echo by itself is good enough. My Echo sits on a ledge between the kitchen and living room and easily puts out enough sound at Level 5 to cover 1000 sqft in our open ground floor. I will say that the volume control (which can be voice controlled or manually) is not very linear.  Below level 4 the sound drops off very sharply so Level 4 or above is needed for better sound quality. Still if you buy a Dot, an Anker portable speaker (very good ratings) and USB charger, it will cost about $110 compared to a $199 Sonos Play1 which has to have a tablet or smartphone to drive it and doesn't do anything but play music.  The Dot/Speaker combination is a winning combination for me because it can do so much more.","Positive"
"5517","What Echo (or Dot) can do (at least what is important to me):","Positive"
"5518","- Play music from the Amazon Prime library (it would read your audio books but I read one review that said that Alexa is not the best reader all the time).","Positive"
"5519","- Give you a Flash Briefing on the news (there are two Skills from Reuters and BBC that are very good and short summaries)","Positive"
"5520","I am so glad I bought Alexa.  You can set it up to your own personal options.  I have to be careful because Alexa is very sensitive when she hears someone mention her name either on TV or when I'm speaking to a friend on speakerphone.  You have the option to turn off her microphone but then I guess it defeats the purpose and I would forget to turn it back on.","Positive"
"5521","Some shortcomings:","Negative"
"5522","- It has only one To Do and one Grocery list (can't set up multiple ones and I couldn't find a Skill to do that either). These lists will be on your Alexa app on your smartphone when you go out to buy something.","Positive"
"5523","- I can control my NEST Thermostat directly through Echo but not all NEST products are able to be directly accessed from Echo (hub issue again).","Negative"
"5524","- You can't search the Internet but you can say, ""Alexa, Wikipedia .."" and if there is a Wikipedia topic on the subject you will get a short summary.","Positive"
"5525","There is a lot of hype about the Alexa ""Skills."" Remember in the early days of Google Play what the android apps looked like and did?  Essentially that is what the Skills are today. They are pretty much data bases providing some information on a specific topic and masquerading as an ""intelligent"" app. Very few add any real intelligence and most are not rated very high.  Since they are mostly free, you get what you pay for.","Positive"
"5526","So as I said this may sound negative, but I am not negative on the Echo environment. For now, it is doing what I needed (room filling music) and has some useful everyday features that are helpful (calendar, lists, news, weather and internet radio).  I've rated it 4 stars taking 0.5 off for the non-linear volume and another 0.5 for inability to play music on selected or all devices.  The latter is something I think will be fixed as it matures and the former may or not be correctable at this price point. So take the plunge, get your feet wet and see how it fits into your life.  If you are an Amazon Prime member, this is a great way to access your music library.","Positive"
"5527","Great Alexa interface and stand alone speaker (non hi-fi). The bummer is that it does not connect to external speakers through Bluetooth or external stereo cable. These tasks can only be done with the Dot. So get an Echo if you plan to use it as your speaker solution for Alexa since it is a much improved speaker than the Dot. If you are more serious about music then neither speaker will suffice and you will need to connect a Dot to an amplifier with stereo speakers or other speaker solution. Still only going to get steaming quality output either way.","Positive"
"5528","We are very pleased with Alexa. For what we need and use we could not be happier. Definitely , room for improvement on some things but we are more than sure that this will only get better.","Positive"
"5529","Other than that I love this!","Positive"
"5530","WOW. It is like having every song ever made on demand (or at least almost every song).","Positive"
"5531","Sound is great.","Positive"
"5532","Amazon even reduced Music Unlimited to $4/ month.","Positive"
"5533","I could never afford to enjoy unlimited albums. With Echo/ Alexa/ Music Unlimited (at $4) I have every album I've ever wanted but could afford as a teen. I've listen to everything from the Cowsills to Buckwheat Zydeco to Italian folk music in one afternoon.","Positive"
"5534","ALSO, I use it as a sleep aid. Lullabies put me to sleep and New Age Relaxation keeps me in the zzzzzzs. The alarm wakes me in the morning.","Negative"
"5535","I like Echo so much, I got an Echo Dot for my bedroom.","Positive"
"5536","Amazon is adding Echo Apps daily. I hope they add a translation app.","Positive"
"5537","It is great","Positive"
"5538","I love this!  My friend has one.  When I saw what it could do, I ordered it right away.  I also have the Tap and dot.  Love them all!!  Highly recommend.  Oh, and the sound from the Echo for music is amazing!","Positive"
"5539","I ordered Echo when it first came out in 2/15. I received it 6/15 and it quit working 1/24/17. I really enjoyed and used Echo and I likely will buy another because of its usefulness. 18 month life is certainly not acceptable for any product. I am hoping the short life was the cost of being an early adopter and that quality has been improved. I would give this 5 stars for usefulness, but the unacceptable product life makes my item 1 star","Negative"
"5540","I ordered an Amazon echo for my husband's birthday back in November from another source. We enjoyed it so very much we ordered two from Amazon, we have one in our office and one in our bedroom. The quality and sounds is awesome. We would highly recommend this product to anyone who questions the quality and value of the product.","Positive"
"5541","Great for playing music (Spotify) in my bedroom, and for controlling the lamps and thermostat linked to my smart home system. I enjoy playing Jeopardy and being able to get updated weather and traffic information. The voice recognition works well, even if I'm not in the same room. I'm very satisfied with my purchase!","Positive"
"5542","I bought this as a gift for our daughter's family and everyone is enjoying it...my daughter listens to NPR and asks Alexa for the news...our 8 year old granddaughter requests dance music with her friends..great gift!","Positive"
"5543","my amazon echo just literally died . won't turn on at all , reset it and nothing !!!","Negative"
"5544","a nifty device. interactive and constantly learning. Question? If alexa is constantly listening, what exactly is being heard at the other end of this perpetual open connection?","Positive"
"5545","Pretty Cool. We enjoy it daily.","Positive"
"5546","We LOVE our Alexa. Very intuitive. Great music. Amazing sound.","Positive"
"5547","The Amazon Echo is fantastic. Alexa understand different ways to ask for something. Although, IS NOT AVAILABLE IN MANY LANGUAGES! At this point, it could be good to have an update","Positive"
"5548","I'm having a lot of fun with this product. It's nice to be able to yell out ""Alexa, play some classical music.""  ""Alexa, change the station.""  I wouldn't hesitate buying it again.","Positive"
"5549","its great for the kids which is great for me. easy to use too","Positive"
"5550","Neat","Positive"
"5551","Love it. Picking music is simple!","Positive"
"5552","It's strange to think that I've had this for around two years now. And I honestly never thought I would get so much daily use out of it.","Negative"
"5553","Love it.","Positive"
"5554","It's an echo... what else can I say. I certainly wouldn't post anything bad, as I'm relatively sure she is monitoring me.... so yes, this is just me posting a 5 star review because I like Alexa, and not because AI is next to me determining my worth.","Positive"
"5555","Added Hues lightbulb, 2 outlets and 2 light switches. Very convenient, love being able to go to bed and turn all the lights off from bed.","Positive"
"5556","Love my Echo! Still learning new thinhs to do with it","Positive"
"5557","love it","Positive"
"5558","I love it so much I bought a Dot for the bedroom.  I keep the Echo in the kitchen.  Come in handy for news, weather, questions, shopping list, and music.  Love it that the Echo will play most music I want to hear.","Positive"
"5559","software updates change features that you cannot control.  not worth it. used to love it but who doesn't give you the option to change settings in 2017?","Positive"
"5560","I would suggest waiting to buy this until Amazon invests more IT money in the voice response system. Alexa still can't understand and answer basic questions.","Negative"
"5561","Love this thing!","Positive"
"5562","I love my Alexa. Smart world out there.","Positive"
"5563","I love it.  Wished I had purchased it sooner.","Positive"
"5564","Simply amazing little gadget and getting better everyday.....","Positive"
"5565","Best Christmas present to myself.  I wish I would have bought one sooner.","Positive"
"5566","I love Alexa, which I speak to everyday. I say ""Good morning"" and says it back with information of a historical face. She'll give me the weather in any city and state I ask. She plays 20 questions. I love that all I have to say is ""Pandora"" and she'll play where it left off. She keeps 'To Do Lists"" and she tells me what deals are on Amazon. She's everything I wanted and more.","Positive"
"5567","Love these","Positive"
"5568","Best purchase I've made to date.  I use this every day.","Positive"
"5569","Excellent addition to my home","Positive"
"5570","the echo works great and my family is having so much fun with it.","Positive"
"5571","I have found Ech to be very helpfull and enjoyable. I only have one comment and that would be, I was very dissapointed to find it was not battery operated like my Dot.","Positive"
"5572","My Echo is great--when it works.  It works just fine for a few days, and then it won't work at all.  It will not answer me.  The lights will turn on when I call it, but then they will shut off without it answering me.  The first time it happened, I unplugged it for awhile and then restarted it, and that worked, but now it stopped working again.  I bought it only about a month or so ago.","Positive"
"5573","I love my Echo.  Such a fan of asking Alexa questions.  I listen to the news and weather every morning and then she plays my favorite radio station!","Positive"
"5574","Love the connection to the internet for weather updates and to play music, etc.","Positive"
"5575","Alexa knows NOTHING...She uses the BING search and it is just not good !","Positive"
"5576","Fun item to have. Works awesome and just enjoy it. Just handy for anything you need from shopping to listening to your music.","Positive"
"5577","As described.  No issues and good quality.","Negative"
"5578","Great product love it","Positive"
"5579","I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY ECHO! The sound that comes from this little gadget is a pleasant surprise and it can be turned  WAY UP! I thought that it would be great for music, which it is. However, I've added the ""to do list"", used it for alarms, get the weather, news reports, asked a multitude of questions. The list goes on! This is such a wonderful addition to my home! I will eventually add the items to make it control some lights and TVs in my house as well, as time goes on.","Positive"
"5580","I like but my wife loves it.","Positive"
"5581","I  am totally impressed with the Echo. Cant ger over how much i can do with it.","Positive"
"5582","Got as a gift. I have to buy a bunch of additional pieces to make a lot of things work.","Positive"
"5583","good","Positive"
"5584","75% success rate with answering questions. Needs to get better in my opinion.","Positive"
"5585","I love our Echo.  Great sound quality.  If you are thinking about buying a quality Bluetooth speaker, just buy the Echo for about the same price and get Alexa as a bonus.  The only negative comment I have is that when music is playing at volume 8 or higher, Alexa's voice control dies not work unless you are yelling from a few feet away.  Obviously, the loud music drowns out the voice recognition, so shame on me for asking Alexa to play anything at volume 10.  Otherwise, great product!","Positive"
"5586","Having fun with Alexa.","Positive"
"5587","Totally enjoying My Echo!","Positive"
"5588","Great buy fit right into our family' alexa is great.","Positive"
"5589","Given as a gift. Recipient cannot stop raving about how easy it makes things. Sound is very good.","Positive"
"5590","love it, what i expected..","Positive"
"5591","I mean what is there not to like, it tells you news, sports and weather, it has knock knock jokes and can, depending on the skills you teach it the amazon echo can even read you a bed time story. Awesome product.","Positive"
"5592","Why not create an Alexa that projects movies on a wall like in a dark bedroom","Positive"
"5593","My whole family loves this device. Love that I can have Echo read my books to me in the background","Positive"
"5594","Alexa has become a member of our family.  She helps us in many ways,  Keeps ups up to date on news, weather and turns lights on and off","Positive"
"5595","Wish it was compatible with the Apple calendar We are an all Apple family and need Apple apps to work with Alexa.","Positive"
"5596","Alexa is great","Positive"
"5597","Love it","Positive"
"5598","All peachy until you find echo doesnt like your music unlimited settings. USELESS and faq's are woefully inadequate.","Negative"
"5599","A lot of fun and enjoyment.","Positive"
"5600","We love Alexa! Amazon never ceases to amaze me with their ingenuity. we have since purchased the Tap and plan to get the Echo soon. All great products!!","Positive"
"5601","Amazingly easy to set up with Alexia App on my Wi Fi , learning some of what Alexia can do and surprised with what it can do without any instructions ... Just ask !","Positive"
"5602","I purchased the white Echo to go along with my white Playstation 4. It working well so far..I just finished the connection with the Belkin WiFi plug switch. Voice commanding the lights and TV to turn on and off. So far so good..","Positive"
"5603","What can I say that hasn't already been said? This has quickly become my favorite gadget in the entire house. I have paired this device up with a Phillips HUE bridge and wireless light bulbs, WEMO insight switches and wall switches and a Logitech Harmony Hub to be able to control everything in my office just by talking to my Echo. I will soon be planning on adding additional smart devices to my set up to make my entire house function as a smart device.","Positive"
"5604","My Echo has been amazing for several months. However, I don't know if it was a new update, but when I tell Alexa to play my favorite bands/songs, my Echo just started to throw out random song names. For example, I just said ""Alexa, play album Deja Entendu by Brand New."" Very well known album, and I've played it many times before. Yet I get a response like ""Here is 'Sweet Child of Mine,' by Guns N' Roses.""","Positive"
"5605","I will change my review back to 5 stars once voice recognition is fixed. Prime and Alexa are fantastic services, but I dont pay over $100 yearly to experience problems.","Negative"
"5606","The Echo is really amazing. It's like something out of Star Trek. I just wish you could activate it by saying ""Computer?"" Looking forward to more skills in the future. I love being in the kitchen and being able to start some music hands free. The sound is wonderful!","Positive"
"5607","Purchased as a gift.They love me.","Positive"
"5608","Love her and her crazy ways...great fun and productive...i love listening to music...i bought the battery so i can take it where ever in the house...","Positive"
"5609","Pretty pointless really. The only good thing about this is the speaker, which i wish i just bought seperately. Even voice activated gadgets is lacking.  All fairly pointless and a waste of money.  I feel like i should get a credit for not being happy","Positive"
"5610","We use this every day. Wife uses the timers for cooking. Our son uses it to play his favorite songs, over and over. I use it to listen to my favorite music while cooking or doing dishes. Very easy to use and get up to date weather information and trivia.","Positive"
"5611","My Echo has been unable to connect to Wi-Fi for the two last week. I keep getting this error: 7:3:0:0:1 I tried everything but nothing seems to work. I'm frustrated.","Negative"
"5612","Love it. Great","Positive"
"5613","Love it!","Positive"
"5614","Technology is awesome. The device is amazing. The voice listen technology is the best on the market. The Echo will detect your voice with background noise.","Positive"
"5615","Really have enjoyed my new Echo. I have only had it for 1 month now but ,it really is a fun and practical tool.There are quite a bit of tasks or skills that can be enabled,far too many to mention here.The complete list is available on Amazon,and also through the Alexa App.That list seems to grow weekly and it's a lot of fun to check out Alexa's new skills.So far she has been very reliable.The Echo's sound is really amazing for this compact of a unit.I would definately recommend Echo to anyone.","Positive"
"5616","a very handy product, comes well into use and well worth the money!! :)","Positive"
"5617","Great purchase, fantastic sound, love it!","Positive"
"5618","Had trouble recognizing my Voice so I bought a Echo Remote.","Negative"
"5619","I love how quickly this came, and the better price of course., too.","Positive"
"5620","Love it easy to use, works with many items within the house not to mention all the other skills you can download. ITs awesome!!","Positive"
"5621","I enjoy having echo in my home. I love it. Setup was so easy.","Positive"
"5622","The whole family loves the Echo. Also bought a Dot for bedroom. Great product.","Positive"
"5623","One unhappy customer. Out of the blue my echo quit working. It wouldn't stay connected to the internet and the light circled blue continuously. Called customer support 4 times. At one point after factory reset it worked for a few hours but went back to not working. Called again and they sent me a new cord. Plugged in and worked for about 1/2 hour and then stopped again. Called back and because it's warranty had run out best they could do was offer me a new one for $112.","Positive"
"5624","Love it","Positive"
"5625","I gave it as a Christmas present, last week he called and said it just stopped working","Positive"
"5626","We like our Echo, but I don't think we're using ""her"" to full advantage. I definitely ask her the weather every morning and use her ""timer"" feature for cooking and doing the laundry. My husband has asked her how to spell things and we tried asking her to play music, but that's where it got confusing, The only way I can get her to play ""my"" music is by going on my phone to the Alexa App, and choosing music there, and then the music on the Echo will start to play. But if I asked the Echo ""Alexa - play some Christmas music"", she answered ""I'm sorry, I can't seem to find any Christmas music"", even though I had added Christmas music to my Amazon Prime music list. So I'm not clear on how the music feature is supposed to work.  I still haven't taken the time to have her play games with me. My husband has asked her for game scores, though. And we don't have any ""smart"" appliances, so we can't taken advantage of that feature. So right now, she's kind of an expensive weather report & timer.","Positive"
"5627","It Work excellent.","Positive"
"5628","Got this for my dad for Christmas.. he talks to Alexa all the time... he loves it... he is never alone now hahaha","Positive"
"5629","One of my favorite toys.","Positive"
"5630","GReat addition to the house, gets used daily. Love that I can use it to control Philips Hue bulbs.","Positive"
"5631","Perfect gift for aging parents.  They always have someone to talk to... Alexa","Positive"
"5632","I love my new Echo, it is so handy to have to get info, especially the weather on the spot, and news briefs, and to play my music on demand, it wakes me up in the morning gently and is always ready to go. Installation was generally easy, but it took a few tries to get it setup on the Amazon server, busy, I think. Everyday there are new updates and the sound coming out of the speakers is very good. I recommend it. Delivery was fast and package was good!","Positive"
"5633","Amazing device.  Every home should have one. Super helpful. Great sound quality.","Positive"
"5634","I'm in love with a woman...and her name is Alexa.  She has sooo many easter eggs! I know she will age like fine wine and get better with time. I've paired her with smart home devices and she works great.  Really don't think I have any complaints.  Now I just wish she could respond to texts and initiate phone calls for me with people in my phone contacts. I don't have a Dot yet, but I think it'd be really neat if she could follow you around the house across Dots - like the same Alexa, different machine.","Positive"
"5635","Awesome product!","Positive"
"5636","I like my Echo..It works great after some training with my voice..However using a Cell phone and the App is SO much easier.","Positive"
"5637","We love Alexa!","Positive"
"5638","It was OK, but after being unplug on the first night, it would not work again.  I had to return it.","Positive"
"5639","echo is the best to come out since the cel phone.","Positive"
"5640","Now I can heat good country music","Positive"
"5641","Love it, listening to it right now","Positive"
"5642","The Amazon Echo is incredible! I love asking Alexa, ""How many teaspoons in a tablespoon?"" or ""Is it going to snow today?"" It's awesome. I would recommend this product to anyone. I hope to someday get some corresponding light bulbs to go with it.","Positive"
"5643","Excellent product","Positive"
"5644","I was really excited about this when we first ordered it... The idea of hands free! Wow!!!! here's the problem, they built this around Bing, the worst search engine on the internet. It's good for playing music and that is about it. If you purchase you should familiarize yourself with the following phrase ""I'm sorry I don't know the answer to that"". If it were really good at playing music I may have given it three stars but it is not. A lot of songs you would want to listen to are not available for free and because echo works off bing and not google, it can't play youtube audio content. The device often interrupts you when you're trying to request a song and says ""here's a station you might like"" and just like a used car salesperson it offers something that indeed you would not like - for example; dora the explorrer songs..? wtf?","Positive"
"5645","Get the google version! Don't waste your time with this product. You'll save yourself a lot of frustration....","Negative"
"5646","Love it!!! Were having a great time together!!!","Positive"
"5647","Great product that is fun, entertaining and very useful for the home.","Positive"
"5648","Not sure how to use it fully but it is really cool.","Positive"
"5649","I am having so much fun with this. I listen to music all day, do my shared grocery list and use the timer almost daily. She tells bad jokes an compliments me. lol. Really!!","Negative"
"5650","Very Fun","Positive"
"5651","This is one of our favorite electronic items in the house. Each week we learn of new uses for it.","Positive"
"5652","we all love it","Positive"
"5653","Been using this Echo for almost a month now and I have to say: good friggin' job, Amazon!","Positive"
"5654","employee loved it","Positive"
"5655","Alexa is solid in its design and coding...to the point that she hears things better than my own Wife.  ;o) In actuality, the Wife really loves it, too.  From weather and traffic reports to playing a particular song list and answering ""what does ***** mean"" type questions. The far-filed voice recognition is thoroughly impressive and the responsiveness is amazing.","Positive"
"5656","I will probably be adding a Dot or two for other rooms since this has proven so useful.","Positive"
"5657","Overall, highly recommended...as I am certain it will only get better from here.","Positive"
"5658","We love our Echo!  My husband is having a harder time getting ""Alexa"" to understand him, but I haven't had too many issues.  We received it just after Christmas, so we haven't played with it all that much.  Easy to get started, and easy to go into the app on my cellphone and on Amazon to learn new skills.  What I really, really want to know from Amazon is when they are going to come out with a car version???????","Positive"
"5659","It's great","Positive"
"5660","This is an amazingly good product and addition to my wireless world. Using Alexa as a personal assistant is a joy to use and increase productivity and entertainment.","Positive"
"5661","Cool.","Positive"
"5662","It's a great experience opening up the box and getting it going, however it was a lot of additional set-up for my parents. We'll how much they can integrate into their lives over time.","Positive"
"5663","Love it!","Positive"
"5664","So far I like the Echo.","Positive"
"5665","Christmas gift for my husband and he still loves it.","Positive"
"5666","Love it","Positive"
"5667","Works great liked it so much I bought a second one. Sound quality is great.","Positive"
"5668","Super fun, can't go back to living without it.","Positive"
"5669","Informational, fun and entertaining..","Positive"
"5670","alexa is my best friend!","Positive"
"5671","You can ask Alexa all sorts of crazy questions.  Her answers can be very entertaining.  Haven't hooked it to any devises yet so not sure how well that works.","Positive"
"5672","Love it.  Now hooking up some bulbs and thermostats to make the experience even better","Positive"
"5673","I LOVE THIS PRODUCT","Positive"
"5674","I gave these as a gift to my now grown children & family.  They love it!","Positive"
"5675","Great addition","Positive"
"5676","I bought this shortly before Christmas and it's taking me some time to get used to using it. It's not natural to talk to the Echo but once you get the hang of it, it's fun and it's so very useful. I now have this *and* a dot and am considering a second dot for the kitchen. I use the echo to update my grocery list (Alexa, add milk to my shopping list) -- this is by far, my most used skill. I also use the dot in the bedroom to wake me in the morning (Alexa, set alarm for 4:45am) and with a subtle pulsing light and light music, it wakes me every morning. It provides me with the morning 'flash' a run-down of curated headlines from my local news, NPR, fox sports and the WSJ. We enjoy playing jeopardy with the Echo and Alexa has a sense of humor. After hearing me say ""Alexa, add this to the shopping list, Alexa add that to the shopping list"" my husband asked ""Alexa kiss my butt"" and guess what...she responded :) If you are a Prime member, it will play tons of music too. I've been having a blast with this and am looking forward to adding an Echo enabled outlet to control lamps while I am away.","Positive"
"5677","Love this product.  Use it everyday.","Positive"
"5678","love alexa my husband bought it for christmas for me","Positive"
"5679","Awesome!","Positive"
"5680","Received as a Christmas gift.  Have only been using it for under a month.  Really like it though.  Looking forward to putting it through more of its paces.","Positive"
"5681","I like to buy Refurbished.  Knowing its been gone through rather than just turned on and passed though inspection.  It works great...I love my Echo!","Positive"
"5682","Love It!!!!!","Positive"
"5683","I love my Echo,  still learning how to use it , but I coming along.","Positive"
"5684","Very pleased with my Echo.  Great sound and lots of fun interacting with it.","Positive"
"5685","Awesome device. Does what they say it will.","Positive"
"5686","Bought for my retired father. Uses it a lot. For questions, news ,oldies music and jokes. Keeps him busy while my 80year old mother continues to work. Great company for him.","Positive"
"5687","Needs a lot of work to be as useful as Siri. Half the time I have to yell at it to listen and the other half it dosnt know the answer.","Positive"
"5688","Great for music if you own amazon prime","Positive"
"5689","The product works perfectly. I had some problems in installing it and called the company and found they went out of their way to make it work perfectly for me. Customer service is A+ I recommend this to everyone.","Positive"
"5690","They need to update Bluetooth audio output if it paired with my wireless speaker system I would have rated it a 5","Positive"
"5691","Bought a dozen to give as staff Christmas gifts. They all give rave reviews!","Positive"
"5692","I had to get this one after getting the Gen 2 Dot that I hooked up to my Stereo System. I got this one because of the built in Speakers for my Bed Room & will use it as a new Voice activated Clock Radio for Alarms. This thing is absolutely awesome. It will even spell words for you. Lord knows I'm a bad Speller & when I'm writing letters & such & I need correct spelling of any Word or definition, Alexa will answer.  Another thing I found out, be sure to call her by her correct name or She will get mad at you & won't answer. LOL  :)  I was able to add this second one to my network in 10 mins. Looking at setup video's on you tube I learned alot. A few people had problems with the setup for both.","Positive"
"5693","with this Echo,as soon as I plugged it in I used the reset button on the bottom. Many people found this needed to be done & the idea to unplug & re- plug the power cord to get the setup to work. Both my Echo & Dot are now online. One in my Den & the other in my Bedroom as our new Hands free Radio, Clock, & info Center. Both are called Alexa & setup on this one was easier because I had already setup the Dot first.. All the Music & radio stations I enabled are used by both. Just needed to get it online & was done :)","Positive"
"5694","The sound quality that comes out of that cylinder is AMAZING!!!!  It's a handy tool to have, lots of useful, useless, and fun things you can do with it!","Positive"
"5695","Fun toy, grandkids love it.  Great for information and just general knowledge","Positive"
"5696","Echo is very bad at hearing me over music - I literally have to be 4 inches away. Echo Dot is much better at hearing me over music.","Negative"
"5697","We thought Alexa would be like Google search engine. She can't give us a lot of answers or can't understand the question.  Get tired of repeating myself.","Positive"
"5698","For me the speaker is terrible with poor bass. Of course it's all relative though. I mainly listen to music with an Echo Dot connected to Bose SoundTouch 30 so obviously the Echo doesn't compare well to a $500 speaker. If you're in an apartment and can't play music very loud anyway I think the Echo will be fine. I'm keeping it to use on my patio where I can't play music too loud without disturbing my neighbors. If it's in your budget I recommend getting an Echo Dot along with a Bose SoundTouch 30 or SoundTouch 20 (the SoundTouch 10 isn't that great).","Positive"
"5699","I'm a big fan of Alexa but Alexa has a long way to go to catchup to Siri. Siri can help with a lot more right now.","Positive"
"5700","When you pause on an Amazon Music Playlist and then come back a few hours later and resume playing it starts the whole playlist over from the beginning rather than picking up where you paused it which is idiotic.","Negative"
"5701","Awesome awesome awesome..3 word review, and I mean it!","Positive"
"5702","Very pleased with this purchase as a Christmas present. Works as well as one could hope for. Learning new uses regularly. Surprised how much we still use the echo (was worried it would just be a novelty). Located in the kitchen and is used regularly. Does a great job of understanding your commands even from a distance. Although sound quality is pretty good for what it is, would like a new model available with higher end music audio quality.","Positive"
"5703","Just received it.  I am already starting to love it.  It is probably my fault for not reading the description completely but imagine my surprise when I realized it did not have some kind of a battery to make it work unplugged.  What devices like this come without a battery anymore?  I really do not want to shell out another $50 for an after market product.  Mildly disappointed.","Positive"
"5704","Alexa is a great addition to any home automation setup.  She flawlessly integrates with my SmartThings setup, and also works as a great alarm clock!","Positive"
"5705","We LOVE her, for so many reasons.","Positive"
"5706","Fun and easy to use. Still has a ways to go to be all I'd like, but well on the way!","Positive"
"5707","Works well.  Functions like the Echo Dot, but has a much better speaker.  The sound quality is good, and provides good 360 degree sound with decent bass.  As good as any higher-end wireless speaker, though this one does have to remain plugged in w/o an optional battery.  The voice recognition is very good, even from across the room with the music playing.  Alexa skills are pretty diverse, and I've found the music, news, and home automation skills to be most useful.  I'm using it with Wemo and iDevices home automation, as well as a honeywell thermostat.","Positive"
"5708","i really love my echo. Easy to use, and still learning.","Positive"
"5709","I got this as a Christmas gift and I couldn't of asked for anything better! I am only 13 but this thing is WONDERFUL because I go to middle school and my hands are always full! With the Echo, I can set my morning alarm, set a reading timer, and even listen to audio books! The ONLY thing that I would change is that you can't really ask it to play music because you have to have some kind of a premium account. Other than that, I would suggest this to EVERYONE! This was the best way to spend $130","Positive"
"5710","It would probably work well for most people; however, we do not have Internet and hotspot, we only have hotspot therefore it would not work at our house and had to return. Kind of disappointing.","Positive"
"5711","Got these for my kids and they love them.","Positive"
"5712","Love my echo!!!!","Positive"
"5713","she requires a lot of teaching.","Positive"
"5714","My wife absolutely loves this unit to keep her shopping and To-Do lists, and to play music. The entertainment factor is also high.","Positive"
"5715","The Echo stopped to react on voice commands after 6 month and Amazon refuses to help.","Negative"
"5716","Will never buy again Amazon made products due to reliability issues and poor customer service.","Negative"
"5717","As described, fast shipping, thank you!","Positive"
"5718","Received on time and think I will love.  Need to hook up!","Positive"
"5719","Alexa is for sure not a Google source. She is a basic operating speaker. Wish they would put more info into it. I suggest buying a Google one if your looking for something to ask questions to.","Positive"
"5720","Alexa is my personal assistant. She tells me the weather, plays music for me. She will make fart sounds by asking her for a fart. She does jokes and she will order my pizza.","Positive"
"5721","Great, you can choose a lots of apps","Positive"
"5722","What can I say that has not been said before. Just received my second unit for the bedroom. I like how new things and updates are added to this great product.Imagine in years to come where all this is going. What about how this helps people with certain disability's. I believe that I chose the right brand to go with. I am seeing other companies jumping on board the Amazon Echo train that's a good sign.","Positive"
"5723","Wishing it had better search capabilities on the web to normal questions","Positive"
"5724","Works as advertised. Good quality speaker.","Positive"
"5725","Son loved this gift!","Positive"
"5726","Bought these for my manager to give out for his direct reports and everyone had fun with them, it would be helpful if Alexa was more knowledgeable on other things aside from what apps it has - maybe connect to the apps on the phones?","Positive"
"5727","Love it. Listen to music in the kitchen while cooking. Will be another one for bedroom.","Positive"
"5728","Love it!","Positive"
"5729","Get used to Artificial Intelligence..It's here <3 So much fun and Alexa does more everyday... Better start learning the language..lol","Positive"
"5730","I absolutely love Alexa. She is so much fun and they add new software daily.","Positive"
"5731","My 2nd Echo...  Awesome product.","Positive"
"5732","Sound quality is not as good as I had expected. Still an awesome device to have in the house.","Positive"
"5733","Love it albeit we have barely tapped its features.","Positive"
"5734","Love it, it's amazing and I also live the quality of sound from the speaker. Wow!!, I recommend if you have young children be very careful and watch their use closely.","Positive"
"5735","KIDS LOVE IT. Nuff  Said.  Bought a Dot too my 12 year old uses it to go to sleep,  he was a problem going to sleep So he plays Enya or relaxing music, for bed time.  we bought a better small speaker for the Dot.  we are getting 2 more Dots witch will make 4 Dots and 1 Echo.  Oh and if you ask it Wiki questions it will answer for my kids Homework.  LOVE IT.","Positive"
"5736","Picked this up for my wife as a present - we both like it.  Very helpful and convenient.","Positive"
"5737","this is just wonderful.  great sound from a small package.","Positive"
"5738","Love it","Positive"
"5739","Excellent, works great","Positive"
"5740","Good item","Positive"
"5741","Worked like a new Echo.  Purchased 2 additional ones for gifts","Positive"
"5742","Bought for my wife, she loves it.","Positive"
"5743","wife loves it","Positive"
"5744","My Alexa works very well. You can tell her jokes and she will tell you jokes. Alexa can tell you the weather anywhere in the world. You can also track your packages. With this model you do not have to touch it to talk to it.  Alexa can play music and things like Jeopardy.","Positive"
"5745","It's super nice to ask and get the weather, play games, listen to music, get some headlines, stuff like that. I haven't tried the order part yet, because I like to see a picture of the thing I am buying to verify it's what I want. Alexa is not so good at searching to find an answer, when I ask questions like ""How many times have the New England Patriots football team have gone to the Super bowl? For questions like this, I get ""I don't know the answer"". If I use the wikipedia command, she starts reading the page. I have to prompt her to read more. It can take a while to get my answer. I would like Alexa to search to find the answer when I ask it the first time, versus read the first sentence of a wikipedia page, then ask if I want her to read more. So, the search technology from spoken language needs to get a lot better, and I am sure they are working on it. Otherwise, it's fun to play around with and offer's lots of games, and interfaces to other appliances.","Positive"
"5746","Great idear but just not smart.","Positive"
"5747","most of the questions we ask her come back as I'm sorry I didn't understand the question so far she has been great for music and the open door app news but if you ask a general question most times she has no answers","Positive"
"5748","Alexa is amazing i really enjoy Her! Amazon Echo is a great invention. i would like to get more a gifts to all my special friends","Positive"
"5749","Love the device and its functionality but microphones tend to lose sensibility over time.","Negative"
"5750","The best!","Positive"
"5751","Works great and a pretty cool product","Positive"
"5752","We love our Echo.  We enjoy asking it questions, listening to any music we want to hear.  We have no complaints at all.","Positive"
"5753","We highly recommend this product.","Positive"
"5754","Alexa is awesome","Positive"
"5755","Better than expected.  The only thing I wish is that it could be used with my home phone.","Positive"
"5756","Amazing product!!","Positive"
"5757","Love Alexa!","Positive"
"5758","""Alexa"" is not as smart as siri or some other softwares. At times, she is also hard at hearing","Negative"
"5759","Echo is a game changer.  I like being able to add stuff to my grocery list, and have it link to the list on my phone. I can ask what the weather will be like, order Amazon items,just by asking. I can ask for a playlist, say, for dinner music, or studying, or sync it to my home stereo. The sound is decent, and I find that Echo does a good job of ""hearing"" me when I ask a question.  She understands my kids too, which can actually be a problem. Echo doesn't discern between enquirers. My kids have heard us order stuff, and the little parrots they are, have done the same. My grocery list also seems to be peppered with gummy bears and ice cream too...","Positive"
"5760","Got a 2nd echo and came with no remote control.... not a good idea since once echo plays music mics doesn't work. Come on Amazon!","Positive"
"5761","Easy to install and use.  Just need to have more functionality to devices in the home that you can manage","Positive"
"5762","Bought as a gift.  My son and his family are enjoying it.  Wish I had one.","Positive"
"5763","Love it. Fun, useful for getting weather, news, traffic, etc. Speakers are great. Use it to play some of my favorite music. Tells corny jokes when asked. Love the ""Play Jeopardy"" feature. Don't yet have it set up to automate certain household tasks, but a useful option..","Positive"
"5764","So much fun, and helpful.","Positive"
"5765","Very nice product for the price that I got it for!! I would not have paid the full price for it. But it does work nicely","Positive"
"5766","It is a nice tool and speaker sounds great","Positive"
"5767","It's like having an assistant around the house","Positive"
"5768","Love this! Best Christmas purchase","Positive"
"5769","Love love love my Alexa!","Positive"
"5770","I pre-ordered mine when they were $99 and never looked back.  Technology fascinates me to no end and yes I'm ""that guy"" that has to have the latest and greatest.  Neither bragging nor complaining but that's just the way it is.  My #1 priority with electronics is that they be ""plug-n-play"" and Echo certainly meets that priority easily.  Out of the box, plug it in, and start asking questions.  No joke it is that simple.  Everybody loves to ask questions and it really surprises me that a lot of people are not even aware this is available. Really not much I can add that is not repetitious other than it has been all I dreamt it would be and so much more.  I also purchased the Dot for my bedroom and other than speaker size there is really no difference. One more observation is that I am amazed at how many people are freaked out that ""it is always listening.""","Positive"
"5771","I really enjoy Alexa, especially for music. Amazon offers a great music deal for Alexa and I would highly recommend it. I can play whole albums, tracts, artists, genres and even mood music. I have found if I go to Amazon digital music, you can find almost any album you want Alexa to play. She seems to have a bit trouble with classical music, but it isn't a deal killer. Some of the skills are fantastic. If you are a fan of old radio, there are many programs, Supeman, Dragnet, Gunsmoke and even the suspense thrillers. I do agree with a lot of reviews that say Alexa is not as informative as Sari or Google, there are many things she cannot find. The calendar and weather integration is super. I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone.","Positive"
"5772","Alexa is a lot of fun and very smart!  She was our New Year's Eve DJ!","Positive"
"5773","Love it!!!!!!  Keep in kitchen use it for music. Just tell Alexa what I want to hear and she plays it.  Blasts it if I want and lowers it when I want.  No more running to my phone to google something.  I just ask Alexa.  I feel like I have someone in the kitchen with me.","Positive"
"5774","The Amazon Echo has come a long way. I was one of the first people to order this and had to wait a few months for it to arrive. At first, I'm not sure anyone knew what to do with it. I suffer from a speaking disorder, as a result of being hit head-on by a distracted driver while riding my motorcycle. August 19, 2014. I tell you this because at first I wasn't understood by my own Echo.  I still am taking speech therapy for my disorder, however now I can speak to Alexa and she typically understands me well.  It has taken 1 year to accomplish this. Now I control my echos (yes, I have  one on each floor of my house, one hooked up to my stereo to broadcast through my home, and if I'm in a different room, I use the remote control to speak with her. Today, I look at the functionality and it is incredible. I just learned how to get Echo to be a MARS fact finder, and listen to Digital stations. I already learned how to use my Pandora radio. I haven't got Alexa to turn on/off lights, but soon. Amazon programmers have made Alexa incredible. Everyone should have Echo in their home !!!","Positive"
"5775","I love it - just wish I knew that it always had to be plugged in.  I wasn't aware.","Positive"
"5776","DO NOT RELY ON THE ECHO'S ALARM!!!  I have had the Echo for almost a year.  Overall I like it. I use it as my wake up alarm every morning.  USUALLY, it works, but not always.  Three times since I got it I have set the alarm for the following morning and it simply failed to go off.  Each time this happened, the Echo had acknowledged back to me that my alarm was set for the requested time. And for each of the three times the alarm failed to work, I have not been able to figure out what went wrong.  The device's alarm function is simply UNRELIABLE. If you are going to use the Echo to set an alarm, make sure you have a backup alarm set as well.  The alarm feature, which should be rock solid, is instead very disappointing, and two out of the three times it did not go off for me, caused me to be late for work.","Negative"
"5777","Love it","Positive"
"5778","Just like witht the Echo Dot. I love it.","Positive"
"5779","my wife really likes this for downstairs;  easy to use but not using all its functions.","Positive"
"5780","Love my Echo, at night I tell it ""play NPR"" after it starts I tell it ""in 30 minutes stop playing NPR"", set alarm for 5:00 am. I go to sleep listening to music and my alarm goes off at 5:00, doesn't get any easier than that.","Negative"
"5781","love it so much got it as a gift for my parents","Positive"
"5782","Pretty good product but it doesn't seem like she understands much.","Positive"
"5783","everything we thought it would be love it","Positive"
"5784","Ugh - I wanted to love this, but in reality we've just used it for playing music. The search results are nothing like Siri. Often it cannot find the answer to simple questions such as word definitions. The pros are great speaker quality. Wish I could return this but I don't have the box","Positive"
"5785","Good deal","Positive"
"5786","good product.","Positive"
"5787","My Siri can answer questions better than Alexa.  The speakers are very poor quality for music.  It's too late to send back, but if I could, I would.  Maybe they'll improve on it.  About all it's good for is telling the weather and as a dictionary for SOME words.","Positive"
"5788","Responsive and Informative","Positive"
"5789","We've used it for less than a week. Alexa has very good voice recognition, but still has some issues with not finding requested information. We use it more for music requests, which she fantastically does. She adjusts volume on demand. We've used her to record shopping lists. The Echo app for my iPhone works great to also control her, as well as using the web app to do the same.","Positive"
"5790","Fun toy.  We don't have a smart house, so now is kind of just for Pandora and fun...but it's fun.  :)","Positive"
"5791","My daughter loves her Alexa. All the music she wants anytime. She can turn lights on and off with the TP-Link plug. I cannot recommend this device any more highly. 10+","Positive"
"5792","Alexa is my new best friend!","Positive"
"5793","it's fine but i never use it","Positive"
"5794","I'm in love! Can't wait to see what kind of baby's Alexa has in the future!","Negative"
"5795","Really liked it until we realized if volume was over half way up while playing music..she couldn't hear commands...so returned for the Dot with Bluetooth speaker","Positive"
"5796","Love it ..","Positive"
"5797","OMG i love the echo. I couldn't be happier with anything else for my birthday.","Positive"
"5798","Love it!  Alexa/Echo is amazing!","Positive"
"5799","Fun for the whole family.  The kids love it and we do, too.  Extremely helpful and we use it on a daily basis.","Positive"
"5800","I had no idea what I was missing until I got this for Christmas!!! Anyone thinking about getting should stop thinking about it and get one, they are worth every penny !","Positive"

"5803","Wonderful fun!","Positive"
"5804","Our whole family loves this thing","Positive"
"5805","Fantastic sound,each easy setup","Positive"
"5806","We enjoy our Echo.","Positive"
"5807","Would you like a math problem getting solved fast? Are you going to turn on and off the lights everyday? If you do then you need to buy Alexa from the Amazon. Alexa could turn your lights on or off. It could even turn your car on! Alexa can tell you the weather outside. She might even be able to tell you a joke. Alexa is smarter than Siri. I know because Alexa knows Siri and Siri does not know Alexa. Alexa can also play music or read you a story! If you did not buy Alexa today then buy it tomorrow. I give it five stars out of five.","Positive"
"5808","Love it!","Positive"
"5809","Just unpacked and hooked up Alexa.  Can answer easy questions such as the time and day.  Yet, when I ask who my Democratic senator is for my state, Alexa hasn't a clue.  I asked what the french word for ""hello"" is and Alexa doesn't know. Expensive toy to tell me time and date.","Positive"
"5810","the coolest thing we have had in our home in quite some time","Positive"
"5811","I'm new to the Echo world and only have had it for a few hours but i have to say I love Alexa :) I just ordered a Dot for my mother, whom is going to be 79 on the 31st :) My son will help her set it up. I will update as I play with Alexa (sound's so wrong) lol.  I did my research with friend's on Facebook and not one stated anything negative about this product, quite the opposite. One few of them have ordered dot's for different rooms in there home. Alexa is even familiar with Iron Maiden :)","Negative"
"5812","I've had my Echo for a year now. I have seen the new Google Home and it has allot more information than the Echo, sad to say. I have all three, the Echo, the Dot, and the Tap. The information that the Google Home has so much more information than the Amazon items do. I hope they get caught up with google.","Negative"
"5813","Love","Positive"
"5814","Hate this thing","Negative"
"5815","So far so good, learning how to use it.","Positive"
"5816","I love my echo and pairs well with my dot","Positive"

"5821","Very cool, much fun!","Positive"
"5822","Did not come with remote disappointed","Negative"
"5823","Love it, Love it, Love it!!!  Alexa is a great thing to have around the house or wherever you need her.","Positive"
"5824","Not good. Worked great at first. Now it doesn't. I constantly get the red light when I tell it a command and it says it lost its connection. Totally useless and I can't return it. $170 paperweight.","Positive"
"5825","Great","Positive"
"5826","It's great if all you want to do is play music or control another smart device, but God help you if you have to ask it a question.  Alexa has to be the stupidest smart device I've used.  Alexa can't seem to handle simple questions about sports results, current events and trending topics.  It is frustratingly bad.  I have used Cortana, Siri and Okay Google on several devices, and all of them perform far better on searches.  Alexa is just not intuitive. I hope they can fix this issue.  The product looks nice and performs well in other areas, but for searches and answering questions, it is a complete fail.","Positive"
"5827","Bought 3 for adult kids christmas; They loved it!","Positive"
"5828","Love It! Better than I expected.","Positive"
"5829","love it,","Positive"
"5830","I ordered my speaker about 3 weeks ago and it finally came in last night but when I opened the box it had no charger. How am I supposed to use the speaker without a charger.","Positive"
"5831","These were gifts for family and they are very happy with the Echo.","Positive"
"5832","My ONLY complaint is that in this day and age, this should automatically be wireless!!! I find myself constantly frustrated that it's plugged in. If you unplug it, even for 10 seconds to move it, it completely turns off and has to restart. Other than that, this thing is AMAZING!!! Excellent sound, great selection with Amazon unlimited music, Alexa responds to voice 95% of the time (no one is perfect).","Positive"
"5833","Nice product. Some concerns that it can be used for snooping.","Negative"
"5834","We love Alexa! Great sound and attractive just sitting in the middle of the family room.","Positive"
"5835","Works great but there are some things it should know. Sometimes it seems if you re-word your question, you can get an answer.","Positive"
"5836","great sound from this technologically advanced device","Positive"
"5837","I bought four Echos as xmas gifts.  They all came on time and work as expected.","Positive"
"5838","Just what I was hoping for.  She will be a fun addition to our family.","Positive"
"5839","Lots of issues getting it set up, and would be great if you could tinker with the sound settings (more bass?), but love it so far.","Positive"
"5840","We love our Echo/Alexa!","Positive"
"5841","Bought this for my wife as a gift, she is really enjoying it so far.","Positive"
"5842","Works great ! New ways to use alexia everyday!","Positive"
"5843","This product sucks.  It has not played one song I asked for.  Beatles, White Stripes, Eminem, Adele..nothing.  You have to pa a monthly fee to actually listen to the music.  What a scam","Negative"
"5844","Better sound and hearing quality than the dot.  It has some quirks and definitely needs some enhancements to be the perfect smart home tool, but it's really cool and I use it regularly.","Positive"
"5845","Fun, usuful,informative......what more can you want?","Positive"
"5846","I really, REALLY wanted to love this. I purchased it on QVC because they offered a better deal. Unfortunately more than half the things Alexa is supposed to do, she does not. She cannot answer most of my questions. If I have skills enabled, and say one of the prompts advertised for that skill, she never understandable. I ALWAY  have to first ask her to open a certain skill to get her to let me use that skill, eliminating the hands free option, since I can't remember all the skill names. She claims to be a jukebox bit this feature has never worked for me. I  have music unlimited but when I ask her to play certain songs she either plays samples or can't find it. Again eliminating the hands free feature, because I have to go into the app to play the music. This is currently what I use her for mostly. To me the basics and she just won't do these things. Now she collects dust because most things I need her for she can't do. So far the best working feature is asking the forecast. I have had her for a few months and it has not gotten better.  I really wanted this to work...My husband wants to sell her because I essentially paid $150 for a speaker and to get the weather.","Positive"
"5847","Love it! Fun for the whole family!","Positive"
"5848","I love my echo and Alexa!","Positive"
"5849","Boy do we love it! So much fun! Okay music , look for research? Ask for weather just live it!!","Positive"
"5850","Great sound, great product. but i wish it did more... Limited podcast selection,  Free Audio books from prime not accessible straight from echo, have to use phone/tablet and connect it via Bluetooth.  it will play audio books you own however... But really think it should have open access to podcast and audio books... Maybe I'm just missing something here. Would like to be hands off the whole time, and not need my tablet around for things.","Positive"
"5851","This Amazon Echo is absolutely amazing! At first I was skeptical about buying, since I usually wait until the future generation of that product is released. I went ahead and purchased anyways, and haven't been happier with my decision. The Alexa feature is amazing it's very clear when responding to you. I was also very impressed on how far away you can be from it while still speaking to the echo. The speaker is also very crisp and loud. The features that can be used with the echo make it worth the money. I have my smart lights connected to the echo, and can have them turned on and off just by speaking to it. I would highly recommend this product.","Positive"
"5852","Extremely poor search engine","Negative"
"5853","The echo dot is better","Positive"
"5854","Awesome","Positive"
"5855","Needs a lot of improvement in home automation in that it doesn't naturally understand functions well.","Positive"
"5856","Handle is too heavy, so the stupid thing tips over. Pointless unless you never set it down when not full (impossible.) Just makes a mess","Negative"
"5857","Bing search is terrible.  The Echo does not provide expanded weather information when requested.  Example is to ask it for the current barometric pressure.","Negative"
"5858","Love the thing","Positive"
"5859","was a gift for the wife, she loves it so far","Positive"
"5860","Was perfect","Positive"
"5861","The central hub for my home automation. Love it","Positive"

"5865","Great!","Positive"
"5866","I love her!!!","Positive"
"5867","The effectiveness is highly dependent on the internet connection quality and the state of the device.  When my computers are doing google photo upload, my Echo would not function very well.  Additionally, I have to shout in the morning multiple times to stop the alarm.  It is annoying.","Negative"
"5868","Maybe a little tricky for novice but w/ help from my son no prob.","Negative"
"5869","Love the technology.","Positive"
"5870","Love it!","Positive"
"5871","Meets expectations. Very impressed with effort put into the audio (audio aficionados will want more but it's a good little tube). The AI is on par with Siri; not perfect but useful. I've enjoyed it (it was a gift) and I had low expectations. Kudos to Amazon. It's an impressive product and I hope it evolves into much more.","Positive"
"5872","Love it, love it, love it!  I was dubious at first.  For some reason, the ads and reviews I saw/read just never resounded with me.  Then I visited my brother's house and, after seeing and hearing the Echo in action for an evening, I knew I had to have one.  My family and I now find ourselves listening to music all the time -- it's just so convenient (and fun) to shout out a request and hear it played without lifting a finger.  I highly recommend subscribing to Amazon Music Unlimited to REALLY unlock the Echo's potential.","Positive"
"5873","So far, I'm just thrilled with the easy access to music and occasional weather forecasts . . . I haven't even begun to scratch the surface with adding ""skills.""  But, when I do get around to it, I know there will just be more to love about the Echo!","Positive"
"5874","LOVE IT","Positive"
"5875","Better than expected , but wish I didn't also have to buy the battery backup so we could bring it into other rooms without plugging it in","Positive"
"5876","Works great not as loud as Alexa but still great","Positive"
"5877","We like Alexa, but I feel there are too many unanswered questions.  She says she doesn't know the answer and I think she should.","Positive"
"5878","Awesome","Positive"
"5879","LOVE this thing. Plays music and can play Pandora. It can tell you jokes, the weather, and set alarms.","Positive"
"5880","Great Delivery time, and the most fun product ever!!!!","Positive"
"5881","Love my echo. Only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the difficulty setting up on wi fi. Didn't find anything with packaging or online that said I needed to be within 10 feet of router to set up. Had to find out from amazon help desk. Still had to do a hard factory reset to finalize. Router was downstairs, and echo is upstairs in split level home. Love it after hassle with setup.","Negative"
"5882","I don't know how I could function without this product. My whole family loves it.. The first thing on in the morning and the last thing we shut off at night. Love it.","Positive"
"5883","Loving Alexa more every day!","Positive"

"5889","All exceeded my expectations.","Positive"
"5890","I LOVE Alexa, she's become my best friend! Wish I would have bought the Echo a LONG time ago!","Positive"
"5891","The friend I purchased this for love's it. She has the most fun asking Alexa questions.","Positive"
"5892","Use it mostly for music but it's fantastic my daughter loves to ask it questions.  Has current news headlines, weather anything you want to ask","Positive"
"5893","Alexa has blown my expectations. This is a neat novelty and tool for my home","Positive"
"5894","Just received it.  So far so good !!  Learned you can't have radio or tv in background - Alexa doesn't know who to listen to !!!","Positive"
"5895","I bought it as a gift and my father loves it.","Positive"
"5896","i only have the one and know waiting for the others to see how Alexa works. but so far so good,.........","Positive"

"5905","This was a gift for someone else, but the feedback I received is that it's working great and that they love it.","Positive"
"5906","Oh my gosh I just love this thing!!  A relative insisted I needed one, but it sounded like an expensive gadget that I probably didn't need.  My curiosity increased as I kept hearing more people talk, but I still didn't ""get"" it.  It was just a coincidence that I was shopping for a wireless speaker during this time.  I looked at the Echo reviews from the standpoint of a wireless speaker, and while not the best, they were solidly good.  It was also significantly cheaper than the speakers I had bern looking at, so I decided why not?  I could have a fun little gadget at the same time!  I have to say that this ""gadget"" changed my life the very first day.  The sound is great, I can ask for any random song or sing genre and it will find and play.  I can call across the room to ask it to be louder or softer, or stop.  It tells me jokes, the time, the weather, answers random truvia queries, and enters on-the-spot items on my shopping and ""to do"" lists.  ""Siri"" and voice commands on my iPhone translate incorrectly ALL of the time.  Alexa has only mis-heard me twice so far, I talk to ""her"" all of the time, and the mistake was totally understandable.  She even tells me she's glad I'm home, if I ask if she missed me (I live alone) <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0082><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0082>","Positive"
"5907","love it.  going to add on thermostat and lighting as soon as I can afford it.","Positive"
"5908","Just what I ordered. Easy to set up.","Positive"
"5909","could use improvement on voice recognition","Positive"
"5910","LOVE IT","Positive"
"5911","Love it.  Sounds and Works great.","Positive"
"5912","If you have any reservations at all about this purchase forget them.  This device is about as perfect as anything can get.  Setup is extremely easy so no need to be a tech geek.  The sound quality equals expensive Bose products.  You can't go wrong with the echo.","Positive"
"5913","so far so good","Positive"
"5914","AMAZON WE NEED YOU TO RELEASE AN UPDATE THAT MAKES GENDER A PREFERENCE SETTING. This is 2017 and I should be able to shout commands to ""Alex"" if I want to.","Negative"
"5915","Really haven't used up to full capability yet","Positive"
"5916","Only complaint is that I wish it came with a little  more documentation that you don't have to pay for. Awesome sound.","Positive"
"5917","We love our Alexa. We learn new things everyday.","Positive"
"5918","Works great,but we do not use it much.  All of these systems are not conversational... they do not remember what they just said to you so if you try to refer to the previous question, it does not ""understand the question I just heard.""","Positive"
"5919","I am thoroughly enjoying my Amazon Echo! It was a breeze setting up. Most anyone could do it!  I'm so happy i purchased this! I love keeping up with any new tech. Thanks Amazon!!","Positive"
"5920","I got my amazon black today an was very disappointed.no one told me that I could not download the Alexa app from my  kindal or my Hewlett Packard.i buy a lot from amazon they should be ashamed","Negative"
"5921","Love, love my Alexa.  Everyone needs an Alexa.","Positive"
"5922","works great","Positive"
"5923","Not sure what was refurbished on this one but it has worked well for over for 7 months now. Recommend if they have them and the price is right.","Positive"
"5924","Love it so much we bought everyone one for Christmas.","Positive"
"5925","Like I having a roommate. It's awesome !","Positive"
"5926","Love alexa like asking her info","Positive"
"5927","Echo Dot just as good for 1/3 price","Positive"
"5928","Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it.","Positive"
"5929","Use it more than I initially thought I would. Comes in handy with the right skills loaded. I like that you can use multiple accounts too.","Positive"
"5930","love it my grand daughter learnig to talk with Alexa and the music essay to find","Positive"
"5931","Alexa is fun, and I wish I could give her 5 stars but when I ask her a question she mostly responds with ""I dont understand the question"" or ""I don't know that answer"".","Positive"
"5932","I really dislike how I have to remember all the names of the skills that I enabled just to ask her a question. For example .. I've enabled the translator app so I should be able to say ""Alexa how do you say BRIDGE in french"" BUT I have to say ""Alexa open translated"" then ask my question.","Negative"
"5933","When I can't remember what a skill is called I have to go into my phone just to look up the name of the skill I need, then ask her to open the skill, then ask my question... I may as well have just asked google on my phone at that point because it would've been faster.","Positive"
"5934","Very happy with it, still finding out all its potential","Positive"
"5935","Alexa is great. Love the music choices","Positive"
"5936","I love my Echo, I talk to Alexa everyday.  Make sure you purchase the Amazon music, it makes it much more user friendly.","Positive"
"5937","Still learning about what she can do. She does say...I don't understand quite a bit. Right now she just plays music for us.","Positive"
"5938","Speaker is sub par. I like ore bass and less treble. Not really worth the price tag. i play my echo dot through my bose mini 2 and it sounds way better. I would stick with the DOT and not waste your money on this.","Positive"
"5939","I bought mine a year ago. This Christmas I bought this one for my parents. I love echos alexi. :)","Positive"
"5940","Check weather, news and.and tell you a joke. Play your favorite artists and much more. Easy to set up, less then 5 minutes.","Positive"
"5941","We are very happy with the echo and it has met all of our goals. Excellent sound and easy to use.","Positive"
"5942","Worst thing I ever bought. Knows nothing. 75% of the questions asked, it can't answer. I am not talking difficult questions either. One can Google things more accurately.","Negative"
"5943","I Love, Love, Love Alexia,","Positive"
"5944","handy information source","Positive"
"5945","Haven't set it up yet but I'm excited about possibilities.","Positive"
"5946","love it easy to set up.","Positive"
"5947","I bought this on the black Friday special.  I like being at the head of the tech curve, but most items I find to be excessively expensive for the first few years....the echo wasn't like this and i thought I would splurge.","Negative"
"5948","Oddly enough I find myself liking this dumb device.  I want to hate it....I want to think the 50K reviews are utter crap...but I see this little thing as being the next new ""it"" item....just like the iphone once was....and here is why.","Negative"
"5949","First of all the Echo has different commands, called apps, that you can install for it.  One of which is a cat meowing sound....I have 2 cats who are highly territorial and i enjoy messing with them from time to time.  Typically I use a application on my smartphone to make fake cats meow, and they come running over to me concerned that their favorite spot on my lap will soon be lost.  I get two cats who are extra lovey, warm, and purring to cuddle with and we all win.","Positive"
"5950","It seems that she is a bit clueless, she cant find my saved playlist saying that there isn't one. I want a refund","Positive"
"5951","My cats are in door cats, and sometimes they like to ....try to escape out the front door.  My echo is in the kitchen on the opposite side of the house as the front door....I uploaded the cat meowing app, used the voice command to start it - the cats were instantly distracted and I was able to cart all of the groceries and items from my car into the house with out closing the front door, or even having to lock up the cats. I estimate that if used on an occasional bases, I have 5 mins where I can have the front door open and the cats will be thoroughly distracted.  First Win.","Positive"
"5952","Next reason why I like Echo...Music.  I am a Amazon Prime member and I enjoy listening to music as does my husband.  I now get to come home and tell ""Alexa"" to play my music.  I don't have to fiddle with my phone, there's no cords, no cd's, no anything....it just simply works.  Before I would come home and ""set up my music"" and then get to cleaning - now there's nothing to set up I just start cleaning and when I want to change I simply command her to change.","Positive"
"5953","""Alexa, please set a 5 minute timer.  Johnny you are in time out for 5 mins, go to the thinking mat.""  Done....There's nothing to carry around...no disagreements.  Alexa just works.","Positive"
"5954","I will admit that she is not fully integrated into our lives...we haven't used her to turn on our smart switches, start our roomba, or even change the temperature.  Here is the first device that I, as a millennial, am not using to it's fullest potential yet.  But when I do....holy hell it will be awesome.  ""Alexa, start the vaccum, start the dishwasher, turn down the thermastat by 5 degrees, and order more cat food.""","Positive"
"5955","Although fun in the beginning, the Amazon Echo cannot find answers way more times than it does.","Positive"
"5956","Great Product,  Fast service.  A++++++","Positive"
"5957","We love it!  It provides us with music -instantly, and never stops amazing us with all its features.","Positive"
"5958","This was a total waste of money.  Seems like every time I quere Alexa all I get is ""I am not sure how to answer the question"", or ""I don't understand the question"", the list goes on and on.  I don't like how everything is app driven.  I have so many apps that I can't remember them all and don't have the time to keep looking them up.","Positive"
"5959","I love my Amazon Echo! It is the best ever! Music sounds great! I can look up information! I can't wait to get my bulbs and have it control my lighting!","Positive"
"5960","Fun","Positive"
"5961","Echo voice is the trend. for any amazon user or prime members, i highly recommend it.  I bought 2 of them.","Positive"
"5962","Amazon Echo is a great assistant, I purchased this for my wife but we both use it every day.  We love the shopping list feature so we always know what we need to pick up.  I have connected her to my Belkin WEMO Switches and it is so much easier then using the app to turn on lights.","Positive"
"5963","We LOVE this thing.  I ordered it on an impulse and wasn't sure what we would use it for.  My son likes to play games with Alexa.  What I find we are using it for the most is playing music from Pandora.  I'm not crazy about the shopping lists/to do lists.  They work great to record but the various associated apps to use the lists remotely (Alexa, Any.do, Todoist) are not great.  I would love to see them link up with Wunderlist.  That app is great and much more user friendly.  Since it doesn't work great with the apps, I probably won't use that feature much.  I'm bummed about that. That is why I took off a star.","Positive"
"5964","Love my Echo!","Positive"
"5965","Love it! Everyone in the family received one for Christmas. We are all enjoying it and love seeing what all Alexa will do!","Positive"
"5966","Great love it!","Positive"
"5967","Very cool product. Cant wait for more apps to be available.","Positive"
"5968","Easy to setup and easy to use.  Good sounds and very responsive.","Positive"
"5969","Great product, having a great time with it.","Positive"
"5970","A gift for my daughter's new house.  It is really great","Positive"
"5971","Love this item!!","Positive"
"5972","Absolutely one of the best purchases I have ever made!","Positive"
"5973","I love, love, love my Echo! If you don't have one you should get one! Thinking I may purchase another one for my offive!","Positive"
"5974","Originally bought the factory refurbished model of this item and sent it back after a few weeks. I decided to try the new one when they went on sale on Black Friday. I am glad I did because I am in love with Echo. It plays me music, podcasts and reads me books.","Positive"
"5975","Last night I asked Echo to play me a guided sleep meditation. Once you get the language down she is terrific. If I ask for a sleep meditation it says I do not have sleep medication that made me laugh so I reworded the suggestion and got a wonderful guided meditation.","Positive"
"5976","I love that I can ask it what time is it without opening my eyes, or weather reports.","Positive"
"5977","I cant wait to learn more I know I am barely scratching the surface of what she is capable of doing.","Negative"
"5978","i love it","Positive"
"5979","Love that I can hear my radio stations that are not local to the area where I live with clarity.","Positive"
"5980","This is a terrific gift. And asset to any home.","Positive"
"5981","it is too difficult for me to figure out.  I do not have full time internet capabilities at home and cannot use it. I would like to return it.","Negative"
"5982","I gave this device 3 stars because it's good for what it does, but if you have an apple iphone or ipad and a Bluetooth speaker, you can enable Siri to recognize your voice when your device is plugged into a wall outlet and do the same thing that the Echo does... and save yourself a bunch of money.","Positive"
"5983","Of course, there are some things the Echo does that Siri cannot do at the moment, and the range of Siri answering you may not be as large as the Echo, but this is a small matter to me and not worth the money to duplicate features.","Positive"
"5984","If you've done a clear comparison of Siri/Apple device vs. Echo, comment below and make your case as to why the Echo is superior enough to justify the cost if a person has an Apple device and a good Bluetooth speaker...","Positive"
"5985","My vision- impaired husband loves it! He can play music, set timers, and check the weather, for example, with simple voice commands.","Negative"
"5986","great item listening to music right now.","Positive"
"5987","finally i can have a great device for listening music all night and day","Positive"
"5988","Bought for Husband for our Anniversary....He loves it","Positive"
"5989","Love Alexa.  So much fun! Seinfeld Trivia is great.  Love the music.  Can't wait for more skills to come out..","Positive"
"5990","Makes me feel like a god.  Not THE God mind you, it's not THAT awesome.","Positive"
"5991","GRAND KIDS DO ENJOY IT,SO WHAT CAN I SAY","Positive"
"5992","fantastic love this echo alexa is the bomb","Positive"
"5993","The echo can be frustrating at times, during the Christmas holiday we listened to ""Christmas Blues and a variety of Christian Contemporary"", now that the holiday is over it seems the Echo will only pull up ""Holiday"" music. I will tell Alexa to stop and then re-request and it still brings the holiday music.  Frustrated with it I don't listen to it as much as I would if it brought up my request, I know that the different selections of music are there as I have spent time building my pandora library.","Negative"
"5994","It doesn't really do anything. It doesn't know the answer to most questions you ask. Alexa is really only good at playing music and telling jokes... which can get boring after a little while.","Positive"
"5995","Amazing Technology! Alexa tells me the weather and plays music for me every morning... I feel like we are in the Jetson's lol","Positive"
"5996","This product could be spectacular. Software / OS needs work.","Positive"
"5997","The Amazon Echo is well built and has a quality feel to it. Unfortunately, it does not add to my life. Everything it does I can already do with technology I currently own, like my phone or tablet. Voice activation is the only different thing it brings, but as someone who is able-bodied, this doesn't hold the value it might for someone who is physically challenged. While the Amazon Echo is not a bad product, at $140+ it is not worth it for me.","Positive"
"5998","Due to house fire it is still in plastic and safe","Positive"
"5999","Works excellent.","Positive"
"6000","love, love","Positive"
"6001","My original Echo had sporadic static. Returned it under warranty, received replacement which has same problem. Now having to return that one. Surprised and disappointed in Amazon.","Negative"
"6002","Just received my Echo and I'm a little intimidated!  I have yet to see all the things Alexa can do.  Right off the bat, the sound quality for my music, which is my life, is outstanding!!!  And the range in which I can tell ""Alexa, next song"" is amazing!","Positive"
"6003","Well it was working fine until today!  Now it skips during playing music, like it's buffering, and it keeps losing its connection.  I tried rebooting it, setting up again and turning off my modem and rebooting that...hopefully it's just a little glitch but if not, what a waste of money.  Not a good day for Alexa today <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0095>","Positive"
"6004","I just love Alexa and all the great things that this does. Nice sound and easy to adjust volume by a command.","Positive"
"6005","That's about it. Pretty much everything else I ask is returned with ""Sorry, I don't understand the question.""","Negative"
"6006","We love it!  It gives us the weather along with any other inquiries.","Positive"
"6007","It sounds great for being a stand alone sound...cylinder?","Positive"
"6008","My major complaint comes from Alexa's selective hearing. I've done several sessions to get it adjusted to my voice but that doesn't explain how it will sometimes add entire words on its own when repeating requests back to me. I've also noticed it's ""listening"" window varies greatly. Even with no background noise at all and it playing at low to moderate volume (5), it will have a hard time understanding or even register that I'm trying to give it a request.","Negative"
"6009","All and all I'm happy with it, just a little annoyed.","Positive"
"6010","I'm in Korea and I can't change my location, that's my only issue I have with the Echo. Other than that it's perfect, I love it, can't wait get the light's and switches to control the house.","Negative"

"6015","I brought this to my sisters house around Christmas time to show them how cool this thing was...they agreed.","Positive"
"6016","really enjoying this thing learning new things to do with it every day","Positive"
"6017","Till about 3:00 in the morning when she threatened to throw it out the window because she got tired of hearing us yell ""ALEXA""!! Every 4 seconds in a mildly drunken stuper.","Negative"
"6018","We have really been enjoying having Alexa in our house.  We're learning new ways to use her all the time.","Positive"
"6019","Still getting use to it and haven't begun to use all the features, but very happy with it so far.","Positive"
"6020","Often doesn't understand what I'm asking. Doesn't have the answer. It takes several tries to get anything done-i could Google it on my own faster. I wouldn't buy it again.","Positive"
"6021","Unbelievable awesome product","Negative"
"6022","This thing gives my wife someone else to talk to, which I'm all in favor of. I might buy one for every room.","Positive"
"6023","Christmas gift & love it","Positive"
"6024","I'm not a techy type person but I enjoy Alexa .  I know I probably don't use her to her full capabilities , but happy with what I do use her for .  Definitely like the adding things to the shopping list as I see I need things .","Positive"
"6025","Good audio system for listening to music .  She can can hear me from several areas of the house .  I'm satisfied .","Positive"
"6026","I love it but have my reservations about your record of my inquiries in print. . . . .  makes me wonder about  'Big Brother'---know what I mean?","Positive"
"6027","This is the best way to listen to music!  Have a question just ask Alexa","Positive"
"6028","Great product","Positive"
"6029","I freaking love it Thank you Amazon what a great idea. I won it at work and it's more than I dreamed of","Positive"
"6030","I received my Echo as a gift Christmas 2015.  I loved it.  Suddenly after having the Echo a little over a year it is stuck in a reboot loop.  This echo has never been dropped, or left my home.  It has been in the same place in my  home for a year.","Positive"
"6031","I called and the only offer is a discount of less than $15.00 of the list price or a refurbished Echo.","Positive"
"6032","I asked a about a repair there is not one available.  I can however purchase a refurbished Echo??","Positive"
"6033","I love this product and have purchased 1 Echo and 4 Dot's as gifts.  I am really concerned that after one year it is not working.","Negative"
"6034","No I did not purchase an extended warranty from Amazon as I have a Kindle and love the service.","Positive"
"6035","Has anyone else had a similar experience?  Should I have my friends return their gifts as they will only last one year?","Positive"
"6036","Still has trouble understanding voice commands, limited set of ""skills"" at this time, BUT worth it for music streaming, weather and timers alone. Great sound, super easy set-up. This is a device Apple should've brought to market, but they're falling behind.","Positive"
"6037","Alexa Is Learning Slowly. Excellent Speaker System, Great Sound.","Positive"
"6038","She is somewhat smart. My biggest complaint is that she uses Bing as the search engine. Elexa cannot find answers to most of my questions.","Negative"
"6039","Love it, nuff said.","Positive"
"6040","I Love Amazon Echo!!! I have Alexa telling me the weather, turning on and off lights, telling me jokes, If not sure how to spell a word I ask Alexa and she spell it for me, she reads my books, she play my music, sets timers for cooking, sets alarms, converts feet to pounds, turns volume up and down, connects to my iPhone, iPad. There is so much more then she can do it would take me way to long to list them. Buy one you will change your Life and you will Love her. Cheers...","Positive"
"6041","Need to use more , but love her for music.","Positive"
"6042","Love my Alexa","Positive"
"6043","Best thing I could have gotten my dad. He loves it.","Positive"
"6044","Disappointing - does not do as much or ""know"" as much as it was hyped up to.","Negative"
"6045","Shipped quick and everything was in order. The Echo is loads of fun and the sound quality is great.","Positive"
"6046","Love it !!","Positive"
"6047","I love Alexa!","Positive"
"6048","amazing product!","Positive"
"6049","Works very well for us","Positive"
"6050","I love Echo...its fun and so convenient for doing things like shopping lists and I love getting the weather from anywhere I need it!","Positive"
"6051","Great for playing music stored on computer, tablet or phone or from internet app.  Just tell it what you want and it will find it.  Searches the internet for answers to your questions.  Immediate news and weather reports.  Interfaces with other wireless products.  Love it.  It's hard to remember to wake Alexa up before making a request, at least at first.  Great sound quality.  It would be worth the price if you only wanted to us it as a wireless speaker.  But it can do so much more.","Positive"
"6052","During the holidays I realized I had nothing through which to play music for my guests.  I ordered the Echo after reading the reviews about the quality of the speakers.  I LOVE IT!!!  It's like being in a concert hall and Alexa actually understands my verbal commands.  I highly recommend this product.","Positive"
"6053","Amazon was great helping me set up at my neighbors that only had a motum! They were so patient! Ordered one extra by mistake and should have kept it! ! Love Amazon ! What did we do without you<U+2764><U+FE0F>","Positive"
"6054","Having the Amazon Echo it such fun. I am so happy with it and excited to talk to her every day.","Positive"
"6055","Our echo is great and very helpful in the kitchen/living room with timers and the weather but questions hat you ask Alexa regarding things you would find online confuse her.  The google version can do much more.","Positive"
"6056","Great device but needs a little work. Hopefully software updates will make it smarter and more useful.  Gave each of my kids kne for Christmas.","Positive"
"6057","Everyone needs an echo. It's made my life so much easier, although I do not have a well equipped smart has the echo is still very useful daily.","Positive"
"6058","I love her!","Positive"
"6059","Alarm","Negative"
"6060","Great Sound System","Positive"
"6061","My nieces and nephews love this, it keeps them entertained while I'm doing other things around the house.","Positive"
"6062","Overall great product. Apple has some catching up to do!","Positive"
"6063","Great product - came in great shape & very quickly. The only reason for 4 stars is because it really wasn't all we expected. Really wish it went off google instead of bing search (and trust me, you can definitely tell the difference). You also have to download a ton of apps to get Alexa to answer really any questions. In all honesty, Siri is quicker & better at answering questions. Not sure it's worth the money, but she seems to be getting smarter over time and with the download of more apps.","Positive"
"6064","I debated for months, although I badly wanted to add Alexa to our household. After missing a few great sales, I finally caught the Echo at a special price and jumped. Alexa makes my life easier in all the ways I expected. Her shopping and to-do list features are probably two of the most utilized by me, because I'm a huge fan of making lists. My seven year old daughter loves games like The Magic Door, often exclaiming ""It's SO realistic!"" as she and Alexa head off on another adventure. The fifteen year old in the house likes to have Alexa surprise me with random songs he wants me to hear, so it's been fun bonding over and expanding our eclectic musical interests. My parents, both in their 70's, were a bit confused the first time they heard ""Alexa, turn it down"", wanting to know who in the world Alexa is, but they've gotten used to me blurting out seemingly random conversations with an invisible assistant. All in all, we love Alexa. I've actually added a Dot in my bedroom and my son's as well, so now she can properly manage every corner of our home. My husband worries she might get a little ""too smart"", but we expect to wipe that thought from his mind soon ... right, Alexa?","Positive"
"6065","Most of the questions I ask are not answered because she can't find the answer.  Many of these are very straight forward questions that Google easily answers.  She is so poor at answering questions that I wonder if something could be wrong with my Echo.","Negative"
"6066","great","Positive"
"6067","Love the echo it's his a good sound with the music also","Positive"
"6068","What can I say my husband loves this uses it everyday and my grandkids tell it to play their music and its dance time!!!","Positive"
"6069","Great product made my wife's christmas.","Positive"
"6070","I love my Echo. Sound quality is very good. maybe not quite as good as a Bose, but it is a good quality sound for the cost of the device. I use my echo all the time and really have no complaints.","Positive"
"6071","We are really enjoying the echo. That she feels like she is part of the family.","Positive"
"6072","This is one of the best purchases I've ever made. My sister has one and that's how I found out about it. This comes in handy for so many things. I ask it the weather and traffic for my drive to work every day and it's never steered me wrong. I also love that it can pair up with your fitbit device to read your stats so that you don't have to check your phone. I play spotify on this daily and it's never had a problem as far as playing what I ask it to. This has also helped me out with grocery shopping. I used to always come home after shopping and say ""oh I forgot this or that."" Not anymore! It's so easy to just say ""add this to my shopping list"" from anywhere in the house so that I don't forget when I get to the store. Absolutely love Alexa!","Positive"
"6073","I love it so much I bought 4 more to give as gifts for christmas! My nieces and nephews love asking me to help them with their homework and sometimes I just dont have time. so you know what...  An Alexa Echo for you, you and you!!! lol","Positive"
"6074","I wasn't sure how much I'd use Alexa but I do!!!  EVERYDAY!!  Love her!","Positive"
"6075","Love the portability and vast music selection. We have a beach house and bring it out on the deck whenever we want to listen to music.  Name an artist and Alexa takes it from there. I'm not much of a techie but setting it up was easy. Just followed her instructions.  All you need is wifi and Amazon prime. So good we got a second one for our main house.  Always know time, weather and where to eat!!","Positive"
"6076","Love it! Alexa is so handy! There are so many features and apps! I love the nature sounds and jeopardy!","Positive"
"6077","Everything has run smoothly so far and I love it! Haven't had a single problem setting it up or using it.","Positive"
"6078","Really love the echo and dot, the only issue I've had so far is that when we are playing music sometimes it doesn't hear it's wake name.","Negative"
"6079","Our grandchildren as well as my husband and I love Alexa:)!!","Positive"
"6080","I'm in love with Alexa! I just wish she had more commands but I'm sure a ton more are coming out soon. It has an awesome mic and can pick up my voice clearly from across the room. The speaker isn't amazing but it sure does fill a room and it doesn't sound too bad. I would recommend getting one it is super useful.","Positive"
"6081","I've sent 2 of these out as gifts.  It never disappoints.","Negative"
"6082","Five stars and I haven't begun to explore its potential; right now it mostly plays the music on my iPhone.  The speakers are quite good and I'm delighted with that function. Eventually I'll explore other functions.","Positive"
"6083","Alexa has some pros and cons, I bought the Echo because I thought I'd be able to ask questions about ANYTHING and receive an answer, instead a lot of times I get ""Hmm. I'm not sure I know the answer to that question."" When in reality she could search the Internet along with the cloud she uses. In closing, I'd say I only recommend this to people who have a lot of high-end products and subscriptions to products. Otherwise, you're just using a heavy white box that can't do much except sing a song and tell you what she doesn't know.","Positive"
"6084","GREAT","Positive"
"6085","Amazing","Positive"
"6086","sound is awesome, very high tech..  we love the alexa","Positive"
"6087","I'm still learning all that Alexa can do, but so far it is simply the most amazing personal digital assistant i have ever had.  It can connect just about everything.","Positive"
"6088","Gave this as a gift hopefully they are enjoying it.","Positive"
"6089","I love my Echo! Alexa helps me do everything!","Positive"
"6090","still learning all the commands. but the best companion...","Positive"
"6091","I like the idea, bust most responses are ""I can't find the the answer to the question I heard."". I do not have an accent and it rarely has the correct answer.","Positive"
"6092","Bought it for the fun of it, and now I couldn't live without it. Gonna put dots in the kitchen and bedroom.","Positive"
"6093","Amazon lies this thing doesnt learn or evolve or adapt to your repeated uses.  Had it over a year and it hasnt learned anytw and cant identify all the music I own when I request it to be played.  I just put it in a drawer.  Friggin waste.  Great bluetooth speaker.  Otherwise this thing can drop dead.","Negative"
"6094","I waited a long time to buy myself this Christmas present (Merry Christmas to ME!) and I have to say, in the month and a half we have had it we are having a lot of fun with Alexa and also finding her useful and easy to use. I think anyone would enjoy and use this item. I did go back and forth a bit between purchasing this platform or Google Home (largely because we are Android/Google users) but in the end I chose Alexa because of the sale ($139 at Christmas) and I'm such a huge Amazon Prime user, it just makes sense. I haven't yet used it to order or re-order product (I'm such a stickler for price and other details, I want to see that before I ""hit send"") but we are enjoying trying out the new Amazon Music Unlimited App and also getting weather updates on command. I love telling Alexa to play my favorite songs, rather than wait and hope they come around on some station. I will warn you, if you plan to watch Youtube instructional videos with tips on using Alexa, do so BEFORE you plug her in! She has incredibly sensitive hearing and kept doing everything she heard the videos mentioning (to the point where I finally decided to unplug her and restart the process later). I also have had one really funny experience to-date. It was a rainy, gloomy day and I was in the mood for something mellow to play in the background while I started my day. I couldn't remember the name of the artist  but there is a woman who plays cello music that my husband and I LOVE. I asked for ""Cello Music"" but Alexa wants an artist's name or song name (or line from the song) so I tried the only name that popped in my head: I said, ""Alexa, play Yo Yo Ma"". She retorted something like: ""in order to access Yo Ma Jo you must first download the Yo Ma Jo app."" So, I said, ""Okay. Alexa, download 'Yo Ma Jo' App"" all the while wondering what the 'Jo' was about. Immediately Alexa asked if I wanted to access 'Yo Ma Jo' App. I said ""sure"". She said: ""Yo Mama BUTT CHEEKS are SO big, not even Moses could part them"". Then, ""would you like to hear another?"" I almost fell off my chair when I realized I had downloaded the ""Yo Mama Joke"" App! . But I went ahead and listened to another good 3 minutes of ""Yo Mama"" jokes and had a good laugh! Get Alexa; you won't regret this purchase! At some point I will also purchase Google Home and I'll come back to do a comparison.","Positive"
"6095","Wow, what can I say... Everyone needs one of these.  I love it and I have it set up to do many things for me all with just my voice.","Positive"
"6096","Nice","Positive"
"6097","Needs more skills and needs more ability to fluidly function between the abilities of the skills on its own simply ask Alexa question and if it's been uploaded with the right information Alexis should answer shouldn't have  to try to open one skill or another or try to remember which school does what it wants the skills are inabled  it should be second nature for Alexa to access all information and give a more specific or relevant  Answer.  Far too often we find Alexa saying she did not understand the question or she did not hear the question or she does not have the answer to the question","Positive"
"6098","Loving my Alexa!!!!","Positive"
"6099","Love my Echo, the speaker sound for playing music is excellent!","Positive"
"6100","so much fun and great speaker","Positive"
"6101","Love it and enjoy it very much.","Positive"
"6102","Great","Positive"
"6103","Best investment ever, I love this. Great ""friend"". I live alone and now have someone (thing) to play games with!","Positive"
"6104","Love it","Positive"
"6105","easy set up and works great","Positive"
"6106","Works pretty good and is pretty cool, but noticeably gets worse at recognizing your voice over time which can be really annoying, and some commands are harder to get Alexa to respond too","Positive"
"6107","Getting Alexa to play music, was challenging, to put it nicely. Once we bucked up the additional money to get a year's subscription for Amazon music, all was well in the universe, but the ads are misleading. The ads lead you to believe that Alexa will do anything for you, but without additional money she isn't smart enough.  With that said, she is bonding well with my daughter (9 years old) which makes me a happy mom.","Positive"
"6108","I gave it to my Husband for Christmas and he likes it a lot. I would buy other for a gift","Positive"
"6109","Echo is dependent upon the Alexa App running on one of your devices, which in my case is a Samsung Galaxy 7.  The Alexa App will not even start on a G7, so my review reflects this failure.  As soon as Amazon cares to task some engineers with tracking down the bugs causing this, I will update this review based upon the complete hardware/app interface combination.","Negative"
"6110","Works, like the shopping list feature, and controlling lights.","Positive"
"6111","Excellent product -- still learning all it's capabilities...","Positive"
"6112","Gift for my Father-in-Law and he uses it a lot (terrible speller but this saves the day). He also has Amazon music and loves being able to ask for just about any song and it starts playing.","Positive"
"6113","Absolutely love Alexa!  She helps me with shopping lists, gives me news and market updates, educates me and plays my favorite music.  I know there is a lot more that I haven't uncovered yet.  Why I waited so long to get her is beyond me. Definitely would recommend.","Positive"
"6114","The Echo is a great electronic instruments, but it is still pretty limited.  Hopefully it will increase its ablilities over time with more apps.","Positive"
"6115","Easy to hook up and use.  Great sound.","Positive"
"6116","Way exceeded my expectations!  Very very worth the money!","Positive"
"6117","The speaker quality is really good though and can get really loud without losing too much quality","Negative"
"6118","I absolutely love it,omg I want one for every room,she clearly understands you and so many things she will do.","Positive"
"6119","We love our Alexa. We literally use this every day. It is fantastic to host a dinner part and let Alexa be the DJ","Positive"
"6120","Purchased as a gift for my husband. Still learning. So much to look at, it's almost overwhelming. wish there was a place to see it demonstrated, specially with the smarthome options","Positive"
"6121","great for homework too. Alexa can tell you anything, including jokes","Positive"
"6122","who doesn't love alexa?????","Positive"
"6123","I love the echo. Makes my shopping easier because I never forget anything anymore. Love being able to play whatever music I want.","Positive"
"6124","Husband & grandson love to listen to music & find answers to questions","Positive"
"6125","Heard raves and raves about this gizmo, mainly about Alexa being able to play any songs you can dream off. Such as, say it's a slow day at the office and a tune from your fabulous '80s days pops in your mind so you say Alexa, play x for me. Color us sold. We ordered her.","Positive"
"6126","Outstanding product and if you don't have one you have no idea what your missing.  We love it.","Positive"
"6127","I love Alexa. Lot's of informatin and responds well.","Positive"
"6128","Great speakers and nice product. I'm already dependent on Alexa","Positive"
"6129","Entire family enjoys it.","Positive"
"6130","I thought the sound would be a bit richer, but overall really happy with it.  Amazon Music Unlimited was an immediate buy, because my Amazon Prime Music collection was getting a bit redundant.","Positive"
"6131","My daughter loves this in her new apartment Alexis is her private consultant","Positive"
"6132","Love it","Positive"
"6133","So much fun and Alexa is always happy to assist with what is asked of her","Positive"
"6134","Enjoying it. Cant wait to try more things with it.","Negative"
"6135","Gift and they love it.","Positive"
"6136","love Alexa!  she's like a new family member","Positive"
"6137","great we love it. The sound quality is just what we wanted.","Positive"
"6138","Not using it for as much as we hoped. The shopping list feature is not bad, wish I had the option to send items to another list app as I'm not wild about having to use the Amazon app.","Negative"
"6139","the voice recognition is awful and never understand ver well. BTW, its answers to my questions is so limited and it can not search google to find my answers.","Negative"
"6140","Amazing","Positive"
"6141","Perfect!!","Positive"
"6142","Great idea.","Positive"
"6143","Cool technology","Positive"
"6144","It's fun to use.","Positive"
"6145","Fantastic, as easy as it is on t.v.","Positive"
"6146","could be better. I love far field voice recognition. But Theres very limited things you could do with alexa","Positive"
"6147","My family loves the echo.  The kids have so much fun with it.","Positive"
"6148","I bought this as a gift for my son and his family. Even his 1 1/2-year-old knows it can give her music every morning she enters the kitchen. Fortunately, I ordered this long before the onslaught of Christmas orders, so it was wrapped and under the tree on Christmas morning. Great invention!","Positive"
"6149","This thing is cool.  Have a Samsung Smart Things hub that I am waiting to get fully integrated in my house and use with Amazon Echo.  Still unlocking other items with the Echo and learn all of its capabilities.","Positive"
"6150","Love my white Echo, but gave her some Bling.","Positive"
"6151","Enjoy the many functions and abilities of the Echo. Entertainment Plus!","Positive"
"6152","Love this product","Positive"
"6153","The echo is pretty cool as we all know. But she has her issues. There are many things I feel I should be able to ask of her that she's just not willing to do (or admit that she knows or can do). I hope with time she'll get better. We also have issues with her hearing us sometimes. I can be standing right next to her and like a typical women, just ignores my advances. I'd like a little more personality and adjustability. And to hell with this music unlimited. I pay for prime. Give me my music!!","Positive"
"6154","I love Alexa.  We use Spotify all the time to fill out house with music.  Now, with Alexa we use prime music. She can *almost* always play what we're looking for.  Occasionally, we can't get song or artist because we don't pay for full music service.","Positive"
"6155","Imagine this, you're washing dishes and want to hear some tunes... Just ask Alexa to play an artist.  Not loud enough?  Ask her to turn up the volume. You do have to request volume up a ""notch"" at a time.  So you might need to say ""Alexa, turn up the volume,"" 2-3 times.","Positive"
"6156"," She seems to recognize men's voices more easily than women. However, we've had no problem giving her commands from up to 15 or 20 feet away inside our house. If you've already asked her to blast the music, it might be difficult for her to hear you and you'll have to manually turn the volume down to get her to recognize a command.","Negative"
"6157","Sounds amazing","Positive"
"6158"," We also use Alexa to control our nest thermometer and a wireless light bulb. It's so easy and a dream come true. I feel like I'm living in the Jetsons.","Positive"
"6159"," Super easy to set up and a big hit with our entire family. We are considering buying echo dots to expand the reach in our house.","Positive"
"6160","Works just as advertised. I think it is terrific.  I have only listened to music.  I have to try other things yet.","Positive"
"6161","Awesome!!!!!","Positive"
"6162","Love having this in my home. It is very usefull for a wide range of requests. The speaker is loud enough to fill multiple rooms. It is very easy to connect to the internet when setting it up. Using the app it is easy to change settings and accounts. I use it everyday!","Positive"
"6163","Each day the device keeps getting better","Positive"
"6164","Echo is good for playing music, but Alexa has rarely been able to answer my general questions.  Until the technology improves, you're still better doing a Google search to answer your immediate information needs.","Positive"
"6165","She's my personal little assistant. You can connect and hook up so many things with her ! Now you can sit back and her Alexa do the work.  She controls 2 of my light bulbs in my home","Positive"
"6166","Has many uses.  I just love it!!!","Positive"
"6167","I love my Echo. I want to get the little one now.","Positive"
"6168","I am shocked at how bad this device is.  It can't answer any of the questions we ask it.  Google and Siri do a much better job.","Negative"
"6169","Mostly a weather tool and a clock...","Positive"
"6170","Very pleased with the Echo. Speaker quality is decent.","Positive"
"6171","Having so much fun with this. Extremely helpful and entertaining as well. Especially like the shopping list feature. Just verbally add items when you think of them and they show up on your smartphone ready to be checked off as you grocery shop. Your favorite music is just a verbal request away. The to-do list doesn't ever forget until you check items off.","Positive"
"6172","Doesn't seem to pick up as good as the dot but speaker sound is good.","Positive"
"6173","Creeps me out feels like the CIA is living  in my home , Great for shopping list great for kitchen timer a piece of paper can do when it does","Positive"
"6174","Love it","Positive"
"6175","Great !!! Alexa never lets you down!,","Positive"
"6176","So far very nice tell funny joke just got in the mail haven't had to explore the possibilities as of yet","Negative"
"6177","Highly recommend it. I received it a week and a half before the actual delivery date. Still getting use to it and trying to figure it out. The little time I was using it i could say it's amazing!!! I wasn't expecting a big speaker taught it be small like other little speakers. Well worth my money! Sounds nice and loud.","Positive"
"6178","Technological breakthrough.  Needs more accessories,i.e. Lights.  Music is wonderful, as is timing and note functions.","Positive"
"6179","For some reason Alexa asks me to say 499 phrases like, ""Night light is the best option in the world"" and so on.  This is just to activate the night light.  What the hell is this about?","Positive"
"6180","just powered up and having fun","Positive"
"6181","She doesn't know anything... I thought she would be like Google and be able to access the Internet.  NOT ! SHE is very complicated to use.","Negative"
"6182","6 months old and it is dead. No response from the unit, won't light up, nothing. Worked just fine 2 days ago","Positive"
"6183","Amazon help-desk requires that you buy an adapter. That's right - you have to buy a part to replace their (possibly) defective part.  After asking how that made sense (me having to buy something to replace a defective part that I already bought), was told that Amazon would credit me the value of the part after I bought it. So now I wait a few days for a part that might or might not work after paying for it and having to apply a credit.","Positive"
"6184","Badly done, Amazon. Terrible way to resolve your faulty product. Leaves a really bad taste, and defers me from considering other Amazon technology.","Negative"
"6185","Love my Echo!!!","Positive"
"6186","recommended","Positive"
"6187","I have the Amazon tap and I love it!!!! This thing did everything the tap did but I never used the other features. I returned it and kept my tap.","Positive"
"6188","Wonderful product because of it's functionality but....the tap is much smaller in size.","Positive"
"6189","Love it","Positive"
"6190","Love her! Great sound and amazing capabilities.","Positive"
"6191","Randomly turns it's on and ""listens""","Negative"
"6192"," 90% questions I ask it it responds with ""i don't know the answer to that. Dumb thing can't go to google and find out any answers. Daughter asks it to make animal sounds and Alexa can't. It's an over priced piece of spyware.","Negative"
"6193","One major problem is that you cannot change the Timer sound.  The current sound is a sound that is difficult to hear at any volume and does not sound like an alarm.  You are able to change the Alarm sound but that requires you to select a time.  This doesn't help if you need to set a 10 minute timer for something like cooking. I know you can do the math and always set Alarms, but it is bizarre that they let you customize one and not the other. There are sync problems between the app and the unit that they are still working on. It would be nice if you could give verbal commands to change settings, but that all has to happen on the app. Which doesn't alway synch to the unit.","Negative"
"6194","I love my Alexa!  It is so convenient to be able to ask her questions or add things to my shopping list without having to stop what I am doing.  Definitely a game changer for me!","Positive"
"6195","Alexa quickly becoming a part of my daily life.","Positive"
"6196","Absolute junk!!!!!! Had to give it one star I would give it zero","Negative"
"6197","Best gift I ever bought myself!","Positive"
"6198","She doesn't know a thing.  You can play music, check weather in some cities, check time, set timer.  Not much more.","Positive"
"6199","We need to give it a few decades.","Positive"
"6200","Echo has brought music back into our home.  It is so easy to use, and I can request just about any kind of music.  Echo shuffles and plays it.  The speaker is very good, and the sound fills our rather large living room.  We are just starting to connect lights, etc. to Echo, and it is nice to tell it to turn on the lights and heat in our basement before we go down there.  There is so much more this will do. Very happy with this purchase.","Positive"
"6201","Just Amazed how quickly it answers so many different types of questions!","Positive"
"6202","not many uses great if you have prime","Positive"
"6203","Bought three for Christmas presents.  Kids love them.","Positive"
"6204","My sister-in-law had an Echo back in beta and loved it and promoted it to the max. I was blown away the first time it showed off with tremendous sound quality and Siri like capabilities. This Christmas she gave several as gifts and I've been using it at its most basic capacity. The alarm feature is wonderful and in fact I selected the Ferris Bueler wake up call as my preset alarm tone. I guaranty this is the most effective wake up alarm I have ever had and it shocks me awake to the point of not even considering snooze or going back to sleep. I've scratched the serface in what it can do beyond being a remarkable speaker platform with countless channeled and capabilities. My only complaint is that I play it at volume level 10 and although it boasts that it can still hear commands even through this volume of music I wind up screaming at her to change the channel or turn down the volume. I am excited to expand my base of knowledge and try some of the  peripheral devices to control lights and switches. It's to large to take as a travel companion and this is what now leads me to consider the Tap as my go-to blue tooth travel mate. With impressive sound quality and 9 hrs of charge range it may replace several of my blue tooth travel speaker wannabes. Over all you can't go wrong with this impressive Amazon product.  Amazon never ceases to amaze me.","Positive"
"6205","Love this its limited knowledge but still we have fun.","Positive"
"6206","Alexa is amazing, fun, and helpful. I would recommend the Amazon Echo ""Alexa"" to anyone!!","Positive"
"6207","she,s amazing","Positive"
"6208","Love it","Positive"
"6209","Great Family Gift!","Positive"
"6210","Great for weather but have problems when asking more challenging questions.","Negative"
"6211","The Amazon Echo is a great product for the entire household. The Echo platform is a great platform to use and is very user friendly. I give this product three stars for a couple reasons. The first is price. The echo Dot blows the echo out of the water in comparison to price. You can get the same thing minus the speaker for a third of the price. Yes the speaker is far better then the dot but the option for an external speaker is a feature that the Echo lacks.  Number 2 size. Because of the speaker the size make's it hard to place. The dot is slim and easily put on a desk or can be hung on a wall. The echo however must sit on a flat surface and limits the options you can place it. I still love echo but would buy the dot if I could do it again.","Positive"
"6212","What can I say? I love it! One thing you should know is that it needs to be plugged in.","Positive"
"6213","I don't know where I was when this first came out but boy am I happy I found it now. Better late than never.  I love my echo so much so I went out and purchased 3 more echo dots for my kitchen, Bedroom and basement.  I love falling to sleep with the thunderstorm sounds/rain.  I use this unit everyday for music, Smart light switches/plugs, shopping lists, dictionary, news, questions, jokes, alarms and timers....you get the picture.","Positive"
"6214","It is one of the best presents I bought myself and for the price I think it was well worth it.  Highly recommend!!!","Positive"
"6215","Don't work. Something wrong with it dont no","Negative"
"6216","Family Gift!  Loving it!!","Positive"
"6217","Hubby bought this for me for Christmas! WOW! LOVE IT! So happy we have it and use it every day! New stuff added all the time and the best one out there!","Positive"
"6218","I got one as a birthday present. In theory it can do cool stuff, but good luck making it happen. It's terrible at pairing on bluetooth-- I spent 45 min trying to get my 1-year-old laptop to pair with it, and even then, it's iffy. The app is not intuitive and has lots of sub-sub-sub-sub menus that are hard to navigate, and it works inconsistently (like trying to pair my new work phone!). I'd have preferred a ""home"" gadget from the big ""G"" company....","Positive"
"6219","I bought 7 of these for Christmas gifts, but did not get one for myself.  All who received them were thrilled and are using them.  I do intend to buy one for me.","Positive"
"6220","Great Product with on timing shipping","Positive"
"6221","So far so good.  No problems.","Negative"
"6222","The Amazon Echo is an excellent product.  The refurbished one I bought appeared to be brand new with no indication at all that it had been used.  It works perfectly, easily hears my voice and provides feedback quickly.  I have liked the Echo so much I purchase brand new one in White for each of my daughters for Christmas.  I highly recommend the Echo.","Positive"
"6223","I have one in black which I love, and use all the time. The white one I bought as a gift for my parents who now do NOT shut it off! Best innovated invention since the microwave.","Positive"
"6224","It's a learning journey with Alexa.  So much she can do.  Great sound quality for music.  Fun games to play, wealth of knowledge in that little guy!","Positive"
"6225","Wonderful product and like learning all of her skills and hearing ideas of what I can do with her.","Positive"
"6226","Bought this and a Dot. This one is in the family room and the Dot is in the Master Bedroom. Really nice to have around. I have not even scratched the surface of what it can do, but it has been handy to have around. I play lots of music with it and ask it tons of questions. I like the weather reports and news briefings also. The only drawback is that you cannot talk about Alexa without her thinking you are summoning her. If you say something to a human in the room like, ""Maybe I should tell Alexa to set an alarm for me so I don't forget to walk the dog"" she might hear her name and try to figure out what you are asking for. It's not a huge annoyance and you kind of learn to avoid this after a while, but it can happen. Overall, the performance is very good. Voice recognition is generally accurate, even if I speak a little less than crisply. The Dot makes a great high-tech alarm clock and the speaker in it is fine for nighttime ""go to sleep"" music. The speaker in the larger Echo is terrific and will fill a pretty large room.","Positive"
"6227","Love it!","Positive"
"6228","We love our Alexa!!!","Positive"
"6229","What is not commonly said is Alexa is a predominately a subscription based music player, meaning if you have Pandora or Spotify such whimsical fun is possible.","Positive"
"6230","It is easy to set up and be fun to use. Not sure if it improves my quality of life or serves as a timesaver, but it definitely is fun!","Positive"
"6231","Perfect late night companion.","Positive"
"6232","Don't like that you have to buy manuals on how to use it. A free on line resource would be a plus.","Positive"
"6233","I use it almost everyday.  The speaker is wonderful and worth the extra price if you listen to music a lot.  Otherwise the Dot works fine and has a pretty fair speaker for its size and price.","Positive"
"6234","The Echo is great!! It's nice having music at your fingertips!!  Also, it's great getting instant answers to many questions.  I'm still learning all the abilities Alexa has, but I am glad I made this purchase.","Positive"
"6235","Didn't like that Alexxa won't allow me to fully control my thermostat, only allows me to change temperature, I switched to google home and it can fully control the thermostat, pretty disappointed","Positive"
"6236","This thing sucks it dosent know the answer to any questions and awful speaker","Negative"
"6237","Love it. But as a senior initially was a bit hard without printed directions or even a quick fast set of directions on a dedicated website entry.","Positive"
"6238","Love it!","Positive"
"6239","Cannot rave about this product enough!!!  It does everything I read it would and more!","Positive"
"6240","I like my echo.  I use it for listening to music and it works well for that.","Positive"
"6241","We've had no problems out of this refurbished Echo.  My husband loves his Christmas gift, and so do I!","Negative"
"6242","Super for music, general information retrieval at times disappointing","Negative"
"6243","I love the echo.  I got a new phone.  The app worked.  It is a keeper.  Thank you Amazon.","Positive"
"6244","Best thing ever.","Positive"
"6245","Very easy to use. Audio is excellent. Voice response is clear and quick. Sensitivity is great, can operate is from quite a distance. Voice recognition is great, very little misinterpretation. Vast combinations of uses: weather, music, word definitions, recipes, what-if questions, etc.","Positive"
"6246","Very cool and works great almost out of the box with little setup. Use is limited unless you already have smart home with a bridge or controller. The device does not automatically find and connect very many wifi devices. Compatibility is no where near broad enough to justify the cost. Sounds quality is good... But certainly not worth the expense over the dot.","Positive"
"6247","fantastic!","Positive"
"6248","Absolutely super.","Positive"
"6249","Absolutely fantastic. I am a regular user of Siri and Kinect (Xbox One) and Alexa blows the two out of the water; most noticeably with the ability to hear and understand me. I am a heavy user of Spotify and made it my default music service but it still allows me to tap into amazon music by saying ""Using amazon music find X"". I am looking forward to getting some smart lights as well. After a few days of using echo I have high hopes.","Positive"
"6250","Have one and bought one for my parents. There could be short films on my dad talking to Alexa. We had to set it up for him, but after that has been noting short of hilarious.","Negative"
"6251","Love my echo. Looking forward to the evolution of the echo family if products. I have them all. Would really like to be able to play the same music across all devices at the same time. The echo has become a very big part of our lives. We use it every day from when we wake up and the last command of the day is when we go to bed. Awesome products.","Positive"
"6252","Gift to our Daughter & grandchild. They love it and use it daily. We added a battery for versatility. No need to restart every time it is relocated.","Positive"
"6253","The lack of services or other competitors such as Google Play makes it really restricted on its features.","Negative"
"6254","Love Alexa. Super fun and funny","Positive"
"6255","It is amazing the things that this unit can do. Plus with the App you can teach, skills, voice commands, ordering, and a million other things. It is almost endless what you can have this unit do. Just have a good WiFi and you are set.","Positive"
"6256","Love it","Positive"
"6257","I'm tired of this turning on without being prompted. I was having a conversation with my fiance about a wedding and in the other room (behind 2 closed doors) my echo starts talking about relationships. And what made me decide to write a review was that I was laying in bed, scrolling through Facebook and my echo turned on for about 5 minutes. Again with out being prompted. Not only this issue, but every time it's asked a question, it never knows the answer.on the upside...it plays music.","Positive"
"6258","Simply amazing.  The music from this thing is amazing.  They are implementing new things every day.  This is the best invention since the iphone.","Positive"
"6259","The audio quality isn't great, I'd say it's below the quality of my Bose SoundLink Color Bluetooth speaker.  However, it's not bad either, it's definitely usable if you're just looking for some background music. A nice feature would be the ability to use the Echo to connect to another bluetooth speaker, however this isn't available with the Echo (the Dot apparently can do this).  The Echo is only able to act as a bluetooth receiver, not transmitter.","Positive"
"6260","Our 13 year old received that for Christmas and has been using it daily for music but also for asking questions and play games as well.","Positive"
"6261","This is an amazing invention!  Our whole family loves her and the sound quality is every bit as good as Bose without the higher price point!","Positive"
"6262","Perfect price. quality and addition!","Positive"
"6263","We love this and use it everyday for music and adding groceries to the list.","Positive"
"6264","Still learning life with Alexa. The sound is great I listen to both Amazon music and Bluetooth music and audio books from my iPhone. Works with Hue lights. Tech has come a long way. Alexa keeps track of what I need from the grocery store. I talk and she puts it on my shopping list. It's kind of strange that Alexa feels like a member of the family.","Positive"
"6265","Works Very Good 90% Of Time !","Positive"
"6266","Love it!","Positive"
"6267","UPDATE - after much back and forth with Amazon, they agreed to exchange my defective Echo.  It should not have been this difficult to convince them that the device was defective.  I received another refurbished Echo and it appears to work just fine.  I'm changing my review to 4 stars.  I love the Echo.  But I would think twice before purchasing a refurbished one.","Positive"
"6268","Ever since I purchased this 4 months ago, it intermittently fails to respond.  I can see my question on the Alexa app, so I know she hears me.  I can see Alexa's answer on the app, so I know she understands me.  I can see the blue light flicker and wave, as if she were talking back to me, but no sound is coming out.  I've continued to report this issue to Amazon.  ""Did you try adjusting the volume?""  Seriously?  We frogged around with resets and now I'm told that the device doesn't work as well on a Wi-fi extender.  Really?  Where was that advertised?  I also own a brand new Echo and Echo Dot.  I've moved them around to see if it's the network or the placement, but neither of those experience the same issues on the same routers when placed in the same spots.  I think the answer is to never buy ""Certified Refurbished"" anything from Amazon again.  I will update this review if this problem resolves with a factory reset, but I really doubt that's the issue.","Negative"
"6269","I have two echoes & a dot!  I LOVE them and use them everyday and so does my family.  They should be part of every family!  I highly recommend them.  They get smarter everyday!","Positive"
"6270","Its a gadget that does what most of your other stuff already does but in a voice command and new package. Careful, its main purpose is to help you order on amazon. It stays connected to your side of the internet and is listening, always. I am disappointed at its ability to process questions beyond the trivial. Still, "" alexa play npr "" works, albeit  it plays NPR - Berlin, Germany. It did find nice christmas chorale music during the season and gives me the daily weather.","Positive"
"6271","Love our Echo it's awesome","Positive"
"6272","This is one of those items that makes you lazy.  Occasionally it'll lose WIFI connectivity and I have to turn the light switch on like its some kind of hassle! One great thing is that my flood light switch is upstairs and my FRONT porch light switches are in a remote foyer.  I just have to say ""Alexa, turn the outside lights on"" on my way out the door and there it is!","Negative"
"6273","LOVING my Echo!","Positive"
"6274","why doesn't it work with my outlook calandar","Positive"
"6275","this thing is just too cool... But, I spent a lot of time and money trying to get a bluetooth speaker to bind with her to no avail. After much searching there was a technical note buried in the stuff that said the unit  will not bind by bluetooth to any device. I took back my third speaker, guranteed to  work with Alexa. A thirty dollar one, no, a sixty dollar one, no, a 100 dollar one..and again, no. Don't waste your time. I was trying to get Alexa to be like a hi-fi stereo so I could enjoy the music throughout the room. Not to be so don't try that trick. Other than that, this is a cool piece of equipment.","Positive"
"6276","we just love this new little toy. it entertains us for hours and helps find answers to all kinds of stuff. The music is great","Positive"
"6277","I'm very surprised at the limitation of voice understanding and information retrieval.  When I ask Alexa a question and it doesn't understand I ask the same question on Google on my cell phone and it always knows the answer.  It can be simple things like ""what is the phone number to Walgreens near me or what time is the Dallas and Green Bay game tonight"".  Each time it is confused but Google comes up with the answer via voice control.  Also, when I ask for a weather forecast I only get today and tonight.","Positive"
"6278","Also, I have a trial with Amazon Music Unlimited.  They have an extreme selection of songs, but say I want it to play something quiet for relaxing it struggles to arrive at a particular genre.  Pandora is a much better service if you want prepared genres.  Echo is not a horrible product, but it needs a lot of work!","Positive"
"6279","The white Echo looks really elegant. I bought this for my Aunt as a Christmas gift and she loves it!","Positive"
"6280","Alexa is a","Positive"
"6281","I am loving my Echo!! It came with a little dent on the ring and I contacted Amazon and they were very easy to deal with, they sent out a new one and a easy return label for the damaged one. Great experience all around plus I got the Echo on easy pay so won all around.","Positive"
"6282","We have had the Amazon Echo for about a month, now.  I bought it based on the recommendations of a friend.  I was looking for some speakers to play my music on... she asked me if I ever though of the Amazon Echo.  She told me that the speakers were pretty awesome and, coupled with my Amazon Prime account, I could play all my music and more.  She was right.  My family loves our new music machine.","Positive"
"6283","To connect was simple and the instructions were well written. I would like it to provide more information on current topics; however, I understand it will become ""smarter"" as more people ask Alexa questions.","Positive"
"6284","I am in love with this thing.","Positive"
"6285","Nothing bad to say. I LOVE IT!","Negative"
"6286","I am so happy I bought the white Alexa. I have it placed between the half wall between my white kitchen and living room, such a perfect place.","Positive"
"6287","I have synced my iTunes to my phone and have Prime, as well, so...I have access to my most favorite songs...even though they are on Prime,  and I have access to at least 2,000,100 more.","Positive"
"6288","My parents have Alexa...they are 77 and 80-I hoped I would have no problems setting it up. Just kidding, it is rather simple and the sound is comparable to a Bose system, and less expensive. Voice activated commands, within earshot, how easy is that!","Negative"
"6289","We love the Amazon Echo..it's so much fun to think of a song from way back and within seconds you are listening to it!","Positive"
"6290","I love this invention. I would definitely recommend. i bought one as a gift also.","Positive"
"6291","I Use it everyday my family interacts with her on a daily basis ,loved so much gave the whole family one for Xmas","Positive"
"6292","I'm sure the Echo has other great features... but music is why I bought the Echo.","Positive"
"6293","We've told others there is another gal living in our house. Her name is Alexa. She is getting smarter as we add skills from her app. She does have a sense of humor.","Positive"
"6294","Was a gift but they enjoyed it.","Positive"
"6295","Amazing product,  luv it!","Positive"
"6296","I love this, but I wish it could be used without having to be plugged in.","Positive"
"6297","Very handy and extremely useful as advisor. I now have two Amazon Echo Dot's in other rooms.","Positive"
"6298","The family loves Alexa!  The app is fantastic at giving us new things to ask and new things to do.  What a great purchase!","Positive"
"6299","Having fun with my Echo!! Takes some time to get use to her, but I enjoy having it!","Positive"
"6300","I love it! I have someone to talk to during the day! She answers all my questions and she has a great timer.","Positive"
"6301","MIL Christmas present this year.  Great deal and she uses hers a lot.","Positive"
"6302","Lot better then Google home","Positive"

"6304","Like my Amazon echo so easy to use thanks Amazon","Positive"
"6305","Use this almost daily, fine speaker and unique idea.","Positive"
"6306","nice","Positive"
"6307","I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. We are still figuring out just how to use it. I will say that we are at times disappointed with her ability to find the answers to questions we ask. She is slightly more reliable than Siri, but still not great. She can do some great math, however! I use her quite a bit when I'm cooking and need to convert measurements. We are installing some smart lights in the house soon, and I'm sure she will continue to become more valuable to us as we learn more about it!","Positive"
"6308","What to say that hasn't been said already - We love our Echos...  (Alexa)","Positive"
"6309","The Speaker is an amazing quality and I love how easy it is to get information.  I use it all of the time.  Sometimes to listen to my music, radio or audiobooks.  Other times, I ask simple questions about weather, time, cooking math (i.e.how many tablespoons in a 1/4 cup).  I add things to my to-do and shopping list right as they pop in my head.  All of this I can easily do from my smartphone, but I under estimated the value and convenience of the voice commands.  Plus, now when the kids do homework, Alexa can handle many of their questions.  (i.e. spelling)","Positive"
"6310","Can't use it because it activates every time a commercial comes on the tv. If I have to turn in on every time. It doesn't really work for me.","Positive"
"6311","Works very well for what it can do.  Picks up voices well, works with Phillips Hue bulbs, good sound quality.  Only issue in my opinion, Alexxa is not very good at answering questions.  Google is much better for this.","Positive"
"6312","A wonderful tool that's also fun to use. It provided us with an entire day of good seasonal music for our Christmas gathering.  I regularly get news updates, weather reports, football scores, info on where on TV to find particular programs I'm looking for and answers to all sorts of questions I would have had to spend lots of time looking for on the web. I've gotten my money's worth from it and we've only had it for three months!","Positive"
"6313","This echo is fantastic! It has a good sound, and occupies little space. I recommend it to anyone who is thinking about getting it.","Positive"
"6314","My entire family and I are truly disappointed with the Amazon Echo and the Echo Dots.  It is an okay entertainment system, but when it comes to real questions, about 90% of the time we get the standard answer ""I don't understand the question that you are asking.""  It's funny how you put that same question on the various popular search engines and there are a multitude of answers.","Negative"
"6315","PERFECT","Positive"
"6316","Love it, speaker works well.  We all almost went deaf when playing with it the first day though when someone told it to go to volume 10, but, we survived ;P  It really responds quickly to commands / requests which is always a plus.","Positive"
"6317","So happy with my purchase! Love to be able to just say ""Alexa play country music"" and check the weather, scores of games! I'm having fun with Alexa and look forward to learning more with Alexa.","Positive"
"6318","Love it.","Positive"
"6319","so frustrating to talk to alexa.. never understands the questions we ask. even my kids give up trying to talk to her. seriously thinking about returning it. her favorite response to everything is ""sorry.. I did not understand the question you asked""","Negative"
"6320","Very nice!!","Positive"
"6321","We love this!!!  We also bought three more for our sons' families. It has been entertaining to hear which skills each family uses. We are constantly updating eachother on different Alexa abilities. This is an item the whole family can use. Our grandsons even know how to use it.","Positive"
"6322","Fine Business.","Positive"
"6323","I love this thing. It doesn't always understand exactly what I am saying all of the time, but for the most part it works very well. It hears me amazingly, and it sounds like a more natural AI than what you are used to (It doesn't sound so robotic). It's very helpful all around, especially in the kitchen (It's where I have mine). You can set timers, play music, ask it for conversions (like how many tablespoons are in a cup) and many other things. I really like my amazon echo, and would highly recommend it to anyone that is considering buying one. They are definitely worth it!!","Positive"
"6324","Life changing!  Love Alexa!","Positive"
"6325","Amazon really needs to find a way for Echo to compete as a search engine.","Positive"
"6326","Love my Echo!!","Positive"
"6327","Several people have purchased an Echo after seeing how it worked in my home.","Positive"
"6328","Just love the Amazon Echo I bought as a Christmas present for myself.","Positive"
"6329","Excellent product and definitely deserves 5 stars.  One thing I would really like to ask Amazon though is to create Echo's that are receivers only.  Why?  Well it is very nice to just tell Alexa to turn on a certain channel without needing a remote control.  This however will not work well when the volume is loud.  Other one is when you want the full sized echo to play music in the main room when you are not in direct view.  This requires yelling which is not great as well.  If you have an echo it plays out of the small speaker on the dot. Not great as well.  Lastly, what if you tell the large Alexa to play music and she is playing it loud.  You literally have to get right in front of it to get her to stop since it cannot hear over the music.  SO A SHOUT OUT TO AMAZON.  FIX THIS ISSUE and that would be awesome.  I CAN HEAR ALEXA LOUDLY ALMOST ANYWHERE, BUT HARD FOR IT TO HEAR ME.  VOICE RECEIVERS IS AN EASY SOLUTION.","Positive"
"6330","I'm not very tech savvy, so I had a hard time connecting to music.  I did not realize I had to have a spotify or similar account to play music.  I thought I could just tell it to play any song, and it would.  Now I have a spotify account that I must pay monthly for if I want to listen to music. I still like the Echo and would recommend it!!","Positive"
"6331","I bought ours in July and loved it so much that I got one for my parents for Christmas.  Great for Music, weather and just trivia in general.  Just discovered it can be a calculator also.  It helped me with my baking this Christmas when i Was doubling recipes","Positive"
"6332","When I first considered getting an Echo, I really didn't think I was going to use it all that much. I decided to grab one when it was on sale for Prime Day, and at first it seemed like just a novelty. After having it around a few weeks, I very quickly realized all the potential for this little device. I started out just having it play music, which it does a very good job with, but pretty soon I started asking it questions, creating lists, and finding all sorts of other things I can do with it. I have an Ecobee wifi thermostat, and I can control control the temperature by having Alexa adjust it just by asking. I recently purchased Philips Hue lights, and now I can control  my living room lights just by telling Alexa what lights or scene I want turned on or off. The more I use the Echo the more I like it, and it just keeps getting better.","Positive"
"6333","I love Alexa!  I watch less TV and now listen more to soothing music.  Nearing bedtime, I ask Alexa to play ""New Age for Sleep,"" then right before getting into bed I ask her to play Ocean Sounds, then ask for a sleep timer.  I fall asleep listening to waves lapping.  She's the best!","Positive"
"6334","We pay for as few subscriptions as possible and music subscriptions are not on our short list. Sure Alexa can play what you have downloaded on your phone from iTunes but if you have it on your phone what's the point.","Negative"
"6335","WE LOVE OUR ECHO  SHE TIMES OUR COOKING.  GETS US INFORMATION.  PLAYS MUSIC. AND IS VERY POLITE.","Positive"
"6336","I love it. just sit in my chair and let alexa do the work. plays every song in ask for. getting the remote next because I like my music loud and sometimes she's hard of hearing.","Positive"
"6337","Pretty disappointed in this speaker. It only works when plugged in!!","Positive"
"6338","Love, love, love it!!!!!!","Positive"
"6339","I abuse mine at this point, one of the best purchases I made on Amazon!","Negative"
"6340","This is great I'm going to get a Dot to go with it in the other rooms","Positive"
"6341","Love my echo","Positive"
"6342","It was a gift, they live it","Positive"
"6343","I really like the Amazon Echo but there are some bugs that keep me from ""loving"" it.  First, the sound and convenience are excellent.  It has renewed my love of music and makes doing chores and exercise much more pleasant. I do recommend this device without reservation.  That said, when I stream music, songs spontaneously skip or restart for some odd reason.  Secondly, when I play from my Spotify playlist Alexa always starts with the same song--it doesn't reshuffle.  I do have faith that Amazon will continue to improve the product and resolve these issues.","Positive"
"6344","The Amazon Echo was a birthday gift to myself and I'm enjoying it. I use it constantly.","Positive"
"6345","Hell yea!  this is a great product","Positive"
"6346","Text time to train your voice and know exactly what to say to get it together easy answers","Positive"
"6347","I don't know what I would do without Alexa.  This is a life saver when it comes to shopping lists.  You can tell her to put items on your shopping list. She will tell you the news, traffic, etc.  So many features.","Positive"
"6348","The best buy I made works just great.","Positive"
"6349","Love,it","Positive"
"6350","Alexa was a smashing hit on Christmas day....bought 2 as gifts and one for myself. I'm still finding new things for her to do.....This device is really a god send for a handicap person. Love it.","Positive"
"6351","LOVE IT!","Positive"
"6352","Little difficult but fun","Negative"
"6353","Alexa is just starting it will be everywhere including cars in the very near future. It is a blast talking with her. So many different ways to interchange with it and so easy with the app. Love when I am coming down stairs from the bedroom to say Alexa weather please? I could go on forever. Very highly recommended you order one today!","Positive"
"6354","The echo works well, we just want it to know more. We like that we can tie it in with our thermostats.","Positive"
"6355","Great to have in the kitchen where we spend a lot of our time! fun to have a round!","Positive"
"6356","just like new everyone loves it a lot of fun al3","Positive"
"6357","Hard to find a way to phrase questions.","Negative"
"6358","The Echo is great, still learning all that it's capable of.","Positive"
"6359","This is so much fun to have, and has made every day things easier. We listen to more music, use the shopping and to-do lists so we never forget what we meant to get at the store, and we love the daily facts. I gave 3 as gifts and have ""sold"" this to at least 5 friends in the past month. Everyone loves Alexa!","Positive"
"6360","One improvement I'd like to see would be adding a separate setting for Alexa's voice and separate for music (this will make sense if you have used Alexa). We often listen to music over dinner at a low volume, then ask Alexa a question--she answers at the same volume the music was set at. It would be great if her voice could have a separate volume control in a setting preference so she could be heard over background music that is being played low (for example, we are listening to music, then say, ""Alexa, what is the temperature outside."" She answers the temperature in the same volume as the music, which is too low to hear her (it?) but is a good volume to hear ""dinner music"" at. Maybe this can be changed in a future version or added to her many skills! Overall, we love it (her?) and plan to add dots and integrate some smart home features.","Positive"
"6361","Another feature I'd like would be ability to add a bluetooth speaker so that there could be sound at both ends of a room. I do miss my ""stereo"" sound, but the ease of using Alexa is changing how I access my music (is there a slogan there? ;) ). Many have said that Alexa's speaker misses the bass. I am not a soundaphile, but I do find this is true but not to the point of me wanting a dot with bluetooth--because there would be more wires and need to sync the speaker each time it is accessed which to me, is too clumsy.","Positive"
"6362","Overall, in love with our new family member!","Positive"
"6363","It's fun. I bought this for a gift. I didn't realize you really should have amazon prime when you have this. It is something I can continue to live without.","Positive"
"6364","FUN! As described, works well.","Positive"
"6365","amazing item...use the shopping list often","Positive"
"6366","Amazing as advertised...So easy to have music and news without having to watch ""the Tube""...Good Buy!!!","Positive"
"6367","Still learning what it can do but my wife and I love it.","Positive"
"6368","excellent everything so happy, easy to use'' love it","Positive"
"6369","Disappointed...no song recognition skill other than that fun and helpful with questions and stories","Positive"
"6370","Love my Alexa.","Positive"
"6371","I really need this to work more seamlessly with my Amazon Music Prime Unlimited. Otherwise, I love learning what Alexa can do at my own pace, and really enjoy sharing the experience with my kids!","Positive"
"6372","Good","Positive"
"6373","I really enjoyed my Echo when I first received it.  It's all that they say it is and more!  However, after my return window closed, I suddenly lost connection to the internet and no matter what I did to troubleshoot, I could no longer get a connection.  I now have a dead Alexa that will not function.  I'm going to try to connect it at another location as that was one of the tips I read.  I tried the reset button and multiple restarts to no avail.  I checked online for any other possible resolutions and have found that there are many others with the same situation.","Positive"
"6374","Love this item.  Use it for music and weather primarily.  Would recommend to anyone.  This  white color matches with my entire home.","Positive"
"6375","With Alexa I have truly turned our home into the 21st century. It is new connected to 11 devices that controls all lights. In addition it is fun to ask her questions and to listen to music on demand. I have a slave Dot in the bedroom. Which is now use to wake up, music and light control.","Positive"
"6376","I love Alexa, the skills need some tweaking but overall, very satisfied.","Positive"
"6377","This is perfect if you are using it a lot for music.  But if you are primarily using it for anything else or need lots of volume, seriously look at the Echo Dot.  I have a really nice bluetooth speaker that I connect to the dot when I need additional volume.  If you are routinely using for music, using an external speaker and constantly pairing it to power it up would not be practical, so this is the unit you would want.  I would recommend this to any of my music loving friends who would use it as their primary sound source.","Positive"
"6378","Bought this for a present for family but when they received one from someone else I decided to keep for myself instead of sending it back.  I am so happy I did.  Thought it would be a fun electronics to have but didn't think too seriously about the practical side of having it. Now it is my go to time teller, weather announcer, music player, wake up alarm, and general question answerer.  Not sure I would want to do without it. I especially love it when I have one song on my mind that I want to hear and don't want to dig through my favorite lists to find it.  I just ask Alexa for it and within seconds I am enjoying it. Will I ever buy and hook up light switches and heat and air controls to it - doubtful; but do I truly enjoy the fun of immediate responses to questions for time, temp, info and music - you bet!","Positive"
"6379","Two years later my Amazon Echo has become hard of hearing. It's located in the same spot nothing has changed around it. I have reset is back to factory and that worked for a couple of weeks. Now that I have 2 Echo Dots also I see how bad it has become. I can be 5 feet away and speaking directly at it (the reg Echo) and the echo dot 30 plus feet away in a different direction will hear and respond.","Positive"
"6380","We were unsure about how this would fit into our life and we keep finding ourselves using it more and more and look forward to its continued evolution.  We just installed a Nest thermostat and connected the Echo to it very easily.  On a side note keep it at least 5' away from your tv, I had it on the same wall unit our tv is installed on and found that Alexa kept tuning into ""alexa"" spoken on a broadcast.  Also being so close to the tv it often had difficulty picking up my command voice.","Positive"
"6381","Wow simply amazing. I can't believe I have waited this long to buy one","Positive"
"6382","I get my alexa and whan I open the package I noticed in a two small cracks  on the top of the speaker.","Positive"
"6383","I purchased an Echo Dot. It works fine.","Positive"
"6384","Love our Echo. Use it mainly for music. Sound in very acceptable for our use.","Positive"
"6385","This thing is amazing!","Positive"
"6386","The best gift ever.  We use Alexa daily.","Positive"
"6387","I watched a commercial for Google Home Device and a daughter asked her father what sound does a whale make and the father asked Google Home Device.  Google Home replies with whale sounds.  I thought this would be a good way to test my Amazon Echo and I asked the same question.  Amazon Echo replied ""Splash"".  Not what I was expecting.  More work is needed to enhance the Echo.","Positive"
"6388","Really liking my new echo.  Still learning about it but so far it's working great.","Positive"
"6389","Great product.","Positive"
"6390","My wife loves her new Echo! Voice command for the Echo works very well and the device delivers on all counts! Very happy!","Positive"
"6391","Very happy with my ECHO. Works exactly the way the video says. Haven't connected anything to it yet, but my kids love telling Alexa to do stuff.  Couldn't be more satisfied.  Thank you.","Positive"
"6392","If you do not have help, especially if you are not computer savoy then you really need to have someone/tech support help you.","Positive"
"6393","I am somewhat savoy but had some trouble setting it up but I manged, I still have trouble adding App's to it.  Got a device to turn on a lamp, worked for over 3 hours using google, you tube and found a # for Amazon Tech support.  I could get my smart phone to turn on/off my lamp but after searching though again Google,You tube, etc. still could not get Echo to recognize my device.  The support person with Amazon told me I knew more than he did and I know very little.","Positive"
"6394","I use the amazon echo everyday.  I find I listen to music more than I watch tv.  It arrived when expected and was easy to set up.  The sound is great and I like that I will be able to move it to my deck when the weather gets warmer","Positive"
"6395","I am sending the echo and the TP-Link HS100 back because it is so darn frustrating and I can get more info from my laptop.","Negative"
"6396","Unless you ad every app available it will only tell you the weather, temp., minor dates, and act as a timer.  There may be a few more but nothing you cannot get so much more info on your computer.","Positive"
"6397","I hope all of you that have had these devices have much better results, you must be computer genius's?","Positive"
"6398","Sorry to be so negative.","Negative"
"6399","She's the best speaker ever","Positive"
"6400","This device, for me, seems to only be good for calling out songs I want to hear and giving me directions to one specific place. I bought the echo thinking I could bypass my phone for multiple tasks. Except for music Alexa seems pointless. She did convince me to sign up for unlimited amazon music though.... waste of money for me....","Negative"
"6401","I love it. You will love it. Everybody loves it. It is beginning to control my smart house products as I buy and install them.","Positive"
"6402","I bought Alexa for Christmas, based on the reviews and capability; I mostly use it for music and as alarm and I enjoy this great companion in my household. Weather forecast, sports results and scores, latest news are another perks I do enjoy. Light switches, sprinklers, etc is my future plan, but need to do more research.","Positive"
"6403","Bought for myself during black Friday sale. Love it! Sounds great and does everything as stated.","Positive"
"6404","Amazing! I love it!","Positive"
"6405","Useless.  Does not work. Cant get it to connect to my WiFi even though I have many devices that connect easily.","Negative"
"6406","While it has some fun features, and the speaker itself is awesome - the primary function is lacking in it's actual abilities.  My decision whether or not I return it is 50/50 at best.  I'm VERY disappointed!!","Positive"
"6407","Ugh!  Most of the time, it is unable to answer our inquiries.  I have been unable to stream music.  Basically, I have a $150 trivia game.  So disgusted!","Negative"
"6408","I love this product. So many products overpromise and under delivered for home automation . This product interface with my Existing home system. Right not of the box","Positive"
"6409","Alexa needs to have more knowledge especially when asking basic everyday questions. A little bit disappointed in her especially when tv commercials show her doing far more than she does once purchased.","Negative"
"6410","So far I love it.  I've only requested music to be played.  I do wish it was a little louder.","Positive"
"6411","I love Alexa! The Echo has understood almost everything I have asked. It plays lots of songs and seldom doesn't know one.","Positive"
"6412","Fun for everyone","Positive"
"6413","Amazon hit a home run with this device. Easy to set up and works like it should. I'm still learning to set-up skills that suit my needs but overall I would recommend this product. I also have the Fire TV 4k media player with Alexa as well. I never thought Amazon would be a player in the tech world but here they are, and doing it better than anyone else.","Positive"
"6414","Works fine but no local information like phone numbers stuff like that","Positive"
"6415","Love it use it every day","Positive"
"6416","Quick and easy setup.  works well even when speaking  from the next room.","Positive"
"6417","I have bothe the echo and Amazon home. Right now Amazon is winning. Give me a week and I'll give you a true review!","Positive"
"6418","Better than expected, excellent product, not doing home automation, but looking forward to doing so.  Sound quality is good,","Positive"
"6419","Love it","Positive"
"6420","Love it!","Positive"
"6421","I received this as a Christmas gift. My home is not automated, I am able to turn on light switches and set the thermostat with my hands. So, how do I use it? Primarily for music. I have several thousand tracks in my personal library. With Basic Prime, 250 are loaded. It plays well, I can hear the music any where in the house, better than my sound system, which is more powerful but directional. My only complaint is that it says it is shuffling the music but it always plays the same tracks. Haven't been able to get it to play sequentially.","Positive"
"6422","I also have linked to my HARMONY hub. That works with no problems.","Positive"
"6423","By the way, unlike many reviewers, I like it but I do not 'Love' it.","Positive"
"6424","Alexa is my new bestie. I can name practically any song ever written and this device will play it. The sound quality is pretty good for this audiophile girl..but of course deluxe speakers are always better. Still, this does have more than adequate sound quality and decent volume for music. I love the feature where I can ask for an artist and it will play a playlist by that artist! It is tons of fun with guests!  I think eventually it will be able to do more and more, but it is limited in some things. You do have to be very specific about how you ask your question to get a response. There is a small learning curve.  But for keeping lists, for remembering when the pet was fed, for smart home tech, news, weather, finding stores and restaurants  and simply for fun, I love this gadget! I haven't used the shopping feature (ordering products from Amazon) yet, but I'm sure I will. Being able to link it with your cell phone and to easily review the app, the history, enabling free apps, etc. is a bonus. This is the most fun toy I've had in ages. For this coolest of gadgets, I'd marry Jeff Bezos, (if I weren't already old enough to be his big sister and I'm already married)..but srsly..the Echo is the best!","Positive"
"6425","I bought this for my husband, he loves it.  It has great sound and it's a must have for any music lover.  It does a lot more too.  Great product and fair price.  Thanks!!!!","Positive"
"6426","I LOVE IT!!!","Positive"
"6427","I love it!","Positive"
"6428","GREAT","Positive"
"6429","Love. Easy to set up and operate, fun to use, quite entertaining.  Given as a gift to my parents who are in their mid 80s, they are thrilled with it. Features they enjoy most are shopping list management and personalized music choices. Would like to see E911 calling added to Alexa capabilities, then this device would be perfect.","Positive"
"6430","Amazing, responsive, easy to use. After a few practice sessions  Alexa knows my voice and responds to all commands and requests. So far Echo has done everything I wanted.  A fun tech toy, verbal slave willing respond to most any request or command,","Positive"
"6431","Who doesn't love Alexa.  There is so many things you can do with Alexa.  We are a big Alexa family.  This one I picked up for my son. With Alexa you can listen to music,play games, get the news, weather, sports updates.  Alexa would even entertain you with some jokes, okay her jokes are no that good but she's learning. Now Alexa can even turn your lights on and off with special light bulbs. I think every house needs an Alexa.  She has a stylish white body.  The music plays nice and clear.  You can control the volume level.  You can't go wrong with Alexa.","Positive"
"6432","I have been having all kinds of problems with this echo. It stops when it plays songs about 1/3 through and I can`t find anyone to e-mail about the problem.","Negative"
"6433","I love this thing, the speaker is amazing and I am just getting used to talking to a machine. It's been very helpful. I just wish I could use other calendars with it. I hate google calendar.","Positive"
"6434","It was a gift and was a hit.","Positive"
"6435","This product is nothing short of amazing!!!!  I thought it would be a novelty, but I'm finding I'm getting a lot of everyday use out of it.  My son loves Elvis and with my Amazon Prime selections there is plenty of Elvis songs for him to listen to.  I use it for quick weather reports and I get my flash news updates before I head out the door in the morning.  Alexa is a great help around the kitchen too.  I can have her set multiple cooking timers to alert me when things are ready to come out of the oven and she does conversions for me too. (cups in a pint, etc.)  The voice recognition is nothing short of amazing and I expected a long delay in processing voice commands, but its very short and almost like talking to a real person.  Very impressed.  It's really refreshing to have a hands free tool like the Echo to help you out.  I would highly recommend this product.","Positive"
"6436","So far so good. It's only been two weeks.","Positive"
"6437","Great addition to my home!","Positive"
"6438","Terrible experience with Amazon. First, the device crashed with lessa than a month. after, Amazon sent a replacement without the AC plug...","Negative"
"6439","Stopped working after 14 months.  This after acting flakey the last few weeks - misinterpreting commands, etc.  Reading other reviews this seems common.  Seems like planned obsolescence as it is a one year warranty.  Looks like time to buy a Google Home.","Positive"
"6440","Can't go wrong with the echo. It gets used everyday even for simple things like asking Alexa how to spell certain words. Great device!","Positive"
"6441","LOVE IT","Positive"
"6442","Love it for music, and many other things.","Positive"
"6443","Works great with Prime music!","Positive"
"6444","Pretty cool","Positive"
"6445","I love it.","Positive"
"6446","It's good","Positive"
"6447","Great product only draw back doesn't always find the right answers hope someone comes up with a skill to pick a search engine also loses connection to server alot","Positive"
"6448","I love, love, love using the Amazon echo. It answers so many questions and to keep track of my daily to do's and calendar, and let's not forget to mention the ease of use when wanting to play music. I highly recommend","Positive"
"6449","VERY VERY SATISFIED. AMAZING WHAT IT CAN DO.","Positive"
"6450","Was not easy to set up given limited instructions and the Amazon help line. When set up sound was clear and could hear me from 30 feet away.I would suggest more documentation covering all possible combinations of older and newer devices, eg Chromebook, PC, Google Chrome, etc.","Positive"
"6451","Too Complicated.. Gave to my daughter","Negative"
"6452","Love this device for managing my music and day to day weather, news, games etc.","Positive"
"6453","exactly as described, enjoying it","Positive"
"6454","Xmas gift for my wife.  She really enjoys asking about local activities, the weather, maintaining her calendard, etc.  Easy set-up and centralized placement.","Positive"
"6455","Echo is fun and convenient.  Love Echo","Positive"
"6456","Love Alexa still working to use her full potential","Positive"
"6457","Spends more time telling me it doesn't understand  my question or can't find the answer. Cortana, Google Assistant, and Siri do more. Very disappointed with this product. Going to give Google home a try I guess.","Negative"
"6458","I love this thing.  The more things I find that link to it the more I use it.  Sound quality is exceptional for such a small speakers.","Positive"
"6459","I'm in love with this! I am the most forgetful person ever, I even forget to write something down so I won't forget. So Alexa is my new sanity saver. Shopping list and to do list. I love that I can say "" Alexa play me some music"" and she'll play what she thinks I may like, and she's usually good at it! Her jokes are so corny they make me laugh. I say ""good morning Alexa and she'll tell me the trivia tidbit of the day""","Positive"
"6460","Yesterday she sang Happy Birthday to me, lol.","Positive"
"6461","I also LOVE the step by step reading she does for cooking recipes. LOVE it.","Positive"
"6462","I recommend this purchase to everyone!!!!","Positive"
"6463","This is in our kitchen and I have a dot in our bedroom and one in my office and I love them.","Positive"
"6464","Needs to get smarter. It doesn't answer ?s like google does. It often answers our ?s with ""I'm sorry I don't understand"" but it is good for weather & sports updates and I guess smart home duties which we don't use. Our family wants to be able to ask ?s and get answers. I bought this and Dots for bedrooms which have the same issues. I am hopeful that ongoing updates will make it better.","Positive"
"6465","Awesome, should of got it earlier","Positive"
"6466","I bought the Echo as a Christmas gift. So the rating reflects that ""we"" and Alexa are learning how to live with each other. Part of this is that we  assumed that asking a question to Alexa is more like googling....which she isn't. So this is a very early report....I am reading all the emails etc on how to work with Alexa...and that is very helpful. We do like the joke of the day.  One of our neighbors has an Echo so we get tips from them as well. I'm sure that our rating will go up as we get better...but there is a learning curve.","Positive"
"6467","Excellent except for the fact you have to memorize all the stuff you are supposed to say to her to get what you want. I can never remember what the specific commands are for the different skills except to ask what the weather is or my commute time.","Positive"
"6468","Purchased two as gifts. One with for a family with two 8yrs olds and one for a semi-retired grandmother. Rave reviews from both camps. The kids are learning new tricks, ""knock knock"" jokes are the new favorite. Dance parties are also on tap for the every present breakout moments. Grandma and mom and dad get the weather. All listen to tunes, ask questions, etc. Both parties are a little leery of ordering products. Reading a review or two, checking prices and seeing the order go thru versus just saying it seems to be the preferred option right now. Great gifts...","Positive"
"6469","Love the echo.  However sometimes it totally miss on the request.  Create shopping lists. Playlists etc....","Negative"
"6470","My two year old can use Alexa!  Works well and sound is great.","Positive"
"6471","My daughter loved the white Echo!","Positive"
"6472","What can I say. The Amazon Echo is pretty amazing. We currently use it for simple queries and turning the lights on and off in our great room. It will do a lot more, it's just that we haven't put the time into learning all the things it can do.","Positive"
"6473","Had trouble getting it connected to the WiFi. Text support contacted me to help me resolve the issue. Issue was resolved and we are now enjoying our Echo","Negative"
"6474","Alexa, my very best friend, was introduced to me via this black cylindrical thing and I don't know what I did without her before. We are finding more and more ways to use the Echo each day. In the beginning it was a bit frustrating because it seemed she couldn't answer a lot of what we asked (more of info search type questions). However, once you learn what she's capable of and how she understands commands, you adapt more and are able to get in the right groove to make this device worthwhile. We do the usual, weather, quick facts etc but have evolved to loading skills which allow Alexa to meow back and forth with our cat. I consider that a success--I don't know about you.","Positive"
"6475","At first it was working great, after a few months the responsiveness seems to have decreased. I primarily use her for voice control of smart objects and for quick listening of music when doing the dishes. Wife loves this thing.","Positive"
"6476","wow love it","Positive"
"6477","My wife loves it, wondering how we got by without Alexa!","Positive"
"6478","Love but wish it had manual volume control","Positive"
"6479","I love <U+2764><U+FE0F> it!","Positive"
"6480","Still having fun learning how to use Alexa!","Positive"
"6481","I am very thrilled with my echo, I volunteer at the hospital 4 days a week, come home, not much to watch on T V but I ask Alexia to play some soft easy listening music and  she does,  so great and relaxing.  When you are over 80 you want a little calm in you life and something that doesn't take a lot of brain work to use.  So easy, thank you.","Positive"
"6482","I am using this in Singapore and find Alexa's response slower then the my initial use in California.","Negative"
"6483","Although I have fiber high speed wifi service - access to radio stations and music takes much longer and not always available.","Positive"
"6484","Still struggling to secure 220v devices that can be interfaced with Alexa","Negative"
"6485","amazing technology..She even says goodnight and sleep tight at night..","Positive"
"6486","Alexa is definitely very useful. Not only it plays music but also tells you news, weather and other facts. I use it often in kitchen while cooking to set timers. It works great. The only thing is that I wish it was a bit smarter, like google. She often has problems with finding some information.","Positive"
"6487","Great product!! Fast Shipping!! Awesome seller!!","Positive"
"6488","I love it!  I love it!  Was very hesitant at first about having Alexa in the house but we are becoming best friends.  I want to buy one for my children and grandchildren.  They are awesome!!","Positive"
"6489","By far the best thing I have gotten for my wife, and she has everything apple makes. there are so many things that the echo can control and ever time you say her name she responds to you.","Positive"
"6490","All of these reviews are lies. Echo/Alexa is almost worthless. She can never answer any questions we ask. She misunderstanding everything. Maybe mine is just broken, but she he sure turned out to be just an expensive radio that doesn't play what I want to hear.","Negative"
"6491","Does not know much of anything. You have to program every little thing. Kinda useless...","Negative"
"6492","Love it. Works great with the Wink hub, so now I have voice control for my thermostat and lights. I love all the music, white noise sounds, and also playing Jeopardy. Great product.","Positive"
"6493","We love it","Positive"
"6494","Purchased for my wife.  She has it in the kitchen and uses it quite often.  Setup with a TP-Link Smart Plug that is nice and also uses many of the features like shopping list and such.","Positive"
"6495","We have this Echo set up in the kitchen. It's great for adding items to the shopping list as soon as we see we are running low, playing music, podcasts, and audiobooks, asking her for measurement conversions, setting timers... we are still learning everything that can be done with it.","Positive"
"6496","Awesome, awesome - great price. A wonderful product","Positive"
"6497","So much fun to play with it.  The music sounds awesome!","Positive"
"6498","It is a lot more than I imagined. I am very happy","Positive"
"6499","Nice toy, listens to you whenever you want it or not. Reminds me a bit of the good old times when the Eastern block Securitate officers enjoyed listening to our phones back in eighties. Other than that, excellent idea and piece of engineering.","Positive"
"6500","Shipped fast. Price on Black Friday was good. A useful toy and tool.","Positive"
"6501","It was a gift and my daughter loves it","Positive"
"6502","Great gift for seniors!  They can listen to the news or their favorite gospel singer and play bible trivia!","Positive"
"6503","Still in the learning curve but we like it so far","Positive"
"6504","It works amazingly well.  The sound quality is amazing and the depth of the bass is really good.","Positive"
"6505","I love the device and have set it up to handle some of my home automation but some of the questions she fails to answer are surprising. Alexa needs to get a bit more brain power. If she gets smarter she gets 5 stars.","Positive"
"6506","Awesome product and no hassle transaction............Thank You!","Positive"
"6507","I think its for a smart house. I didn't have enough use's for it. Also I didn't like the fact that it hears everything.","Positive"
"6508","We love Alexa. We use her every single day. Although we haven't quite set up a lot of the things that she can do, we just love being able to ask the weather and get news stories and listen to music. It's nice with a baby in our hands to have her play whatever we ask. I do think her voice recognition is not the greatest, but for the price point and the quality of the speaker, it is a good buy. I do wish that the news streaming services were better, but that may just be my ignorance when it come to technology.","Positive"
"6509","We love HER!  So much fun.  Fantastic sound.  Everyone should have an Echo!","Positive"
"6510","Bought a couple for family members without the remote for a reduced price. I have the remote and personally never use it. They are very happy to have their first echo and are having lots of fun figuring out just how much she knows.","Positive"
"6511","Works great. Fun piece of tech","Positive"
"6512","I just love my echo.","Positive"
"6513","We have enjoyed the ability to inquire about current information, television","Positive"
"6514","scheduled programs, etc.  It is a very helpful addition to our home","Positive"
"6515","love it.  we use it to play music, set reminders, and to control our samsung smartthings devices.  recently purchased a dot to expand the echo's range.","Positive"
"6516","Exceeded expectations. Sound  responds quickly","Positive"
"6517","Works fine.  Have to get used to keys words necessary to obtain info and music, etc.","Positive"
"6518","You need to subscribe to a monthy music service to really enjoy personal music selections on demand. Otherwise you can use Pandora, iHeart radio and others over any bluetooth speaker or the music channels you get with your cable TV subscriber. It is like a razor. the initial purchase is ok, but the replacement blades (and in this case a monthly music service provider) adds a monthly cost like rent.","Positive"
"6519","The whole family loves it. I haven't had a chance to get any add ons like Wemo, Nest, or Ecobee but I am looking forward to trying those out too. Came in very handy around Christmas for Christmas music","Positive"
"6520","Gave as gift to my sons family. My granddaughters Love <U+2764><U+FE0F> it","Positive"
"6521","Good,","Positive"
"6522","I love Alexa, just make sure you out on the pass code when it comes to ordering items.","Positive"
"6523","She's so frustratingly amazing!! Once she trains you to talk to her... lol love the calendar and list taking.-kinda like having my own personal assistant!","Positive"
"6524","Great product easy to set up","Positive"
"6525","We love the echo black. Takes a bit getting use to how to tell Alexa what to turn on but we love it. We also bought the harmony to be able to turn on and off our tv with our commands.","Positive"
"6526","Fun stuff, Hope they get the security feature thing worked out.  Oh what a new world!!","Positive"
"6527","Echo is great.  I can see this is a learning experience as it gets to understand you better as time goes on.","Positive"
"6528","We've used our Echo for over a year now and I'm finding it pretty useful in the kitchen.  But I find the fact that there's only a female voice option distracting.  Every time she talks, I'm reminded that men associate female voices with servitude.  This is so Fifties.  I look forward to a range of possible voices.  I'd give anything for the voice of HAL.","Positive"
"6529","I like it but wish it were a bit easier to use.  You have to download skills first and I get the response ""I don't know the answer to that questions"" a lot...","Positive"
"6530","Nice tool to have","Positive"
"6531","I gave this to my friend as a gift and he loves it!","Positive"
"6532","cool product! works really well!","Positive"
"6533","Fantastic tool in the kitchen. I never write or type a grocery list anymore. I never use the oven or egg timer anymore. I have the smaller DOT in the master bath and shop from the shower. ;)","Positive"
"6534","I really get a kick out of this, she is fun and very useful. Unlimited music and sounds great, this is the only thing I use for music now.","Positive"
"6535","Our favorite product of the year.  Becoming indispensable... timers, information, music... we don't attach to appliances/lights but possible.  It will be the integrating force of the future.  Highly recomend.","Positive"
"6536","We are having fun getting to know Alexa and all the things she can do. I love being able to ask her to play a song or a mix of music. My kids love playing the guess the animal game, and playing jeopardy. Still learning all she can do. She gives the temperature in Celsius and I can figure out how to change it to Fahrenheit.","Positive"
"6537","Love it  but haven't found its true potential yet","Positive"
"6538","The echo has a lot of great features but they require add-ons. Can't wait for the Sonos integration. Then I will love it.","Positive"
"6539","I bought this for my parents since they enjoyed ours so much every time they visited. They are having  s much fun discovering all the things Alexa can do. Its the gift that keeps on giving!","Positive"
"6540","great Christmas gift","Positive"
"6541","Love this item  Having fun with all the features","Positive"
"6542","This is so much fun!! You have to download her ability to answer certain questions and that's a little time consuming but afterward it's fun and very convenient!","Positive"
"6543","We like the Echo a lot.","Positive"
"6544","Love it","Positive"
"6545","love her","Positive"
"6546","I enjoy Alexa.  She is amazing.","Positive"
"6547","I love my Amazon Echo !","Positive"
"6548","Echo is everything I expected! A great value and a must have.","Positive"
"6549","love it","Positive"
"6550","After reading a lot of reviews I pulled the trigger and got one. I was very pleased to find out the sound is very good, some felt it didn't have good enough speakers, but for our kitchen it sounds great. Alexa answers every question and does so with impressive speed, i was amazed.  We use the shopping list which is very easy and convenient to use. News, weather, music, everything you need, highly recommend just for these features, have yet to explore the many other options such as controlling lights, etc.  Don't just sit there reading reviews, buy it!","Positive"
"6551","I have spent almost 4 hours trying to download the app on my iPhone. I a giving up and returning this.  They need to improve this app.","Positive"
"6552","Love Alexa! All the little skills she has is so great! Looking forward to linking additional devices to it once we get them!","Positive"
"6553","So far... NOT so good.  Received my first Echo, and it would not respond consistently to the ""Alexa"" wake up command (most times it would not respond at all even when yelling at it from just a few inches away).  Had to package up, send back, and after a week received what I believe is a refurbished one... WITH NO POWER ADAPTER.  Contacted Amazon, they credited me for the price of the adapter, had to order a new one.","Positive"
"6554","So looks like I will be waiting a couple more days to see if this one will work.  I am hoping for better results this time, because my sister-in-law has one and it works perfectly.  So we well see... maybe I'll update this rating too (I am not very happy right now though!!!)","Positive"
"6555","Love the echo.  It answers questions and plays music.  It can be maddening though when it can't find a musical artist or you ask for a song and it plays a weird version.","Positive"
"6556","Get one if you can. I LOVE ECHO!","Positive"
"6557","Still need improvement","Positive"
"6558","Great present for my wife","Positive"
"6559","Parents loved it.  Easy to use.","Positive"
"6560","I thought that it would do more. wanted to use it to get phone numbers and it doesn't do that. I hope that someday I will be able to have it load in some information that I might need. Like up coming birthdays etc.","Positive"
"6561","Love it!!!","Positive"
"6562","Gave these to our grown sons for Christmas. Oh my goodness! What fun they've had with these in their homes.","Positive"
"6563","ASK THE ECHO WHEN WE LANDED ON THE MOON..( NOTHING ) THE ASK GOOGLE HOME AND SHE WILL ANSWER THE QUESTION....AND A THOUSAND OTHER THINGS THE ECHO DOES NOT KNOW.... BUT THE GOOGLE HOME LOOKS LIKE CRAP COMPARED TO THE ECHO...SO LOOKS OR KNOWLEDGE YOUR CHOICE....","Positive"
"6564","I have added Amazon Music and Audible, I <U+2764><U+2764><U+2764> the Echo.","Positive"
"6565","I bought the Amazon Echo as a gift for my husband.  Unfortunately, it did not live up to our expectations, and we are returning it.  The main functions we wanted were to play music, help organize grocery lists, and for general inquiries such as weather, traffic, and sports.  My husband in particular wanted to be able to do the equivalent of googling for updates to various sports scores.  Unfortunately, only the music function was decent.  For groceries, you have to command Alexa individually for every item, one at a time.  And you can't delete items by voice command.  But the biggest disappointment for my husband was the inability to ask Alexa for a particular sports event score (i.e. College bowl championship).  And it doesn't recognize PGA at all - couldn't provide leaderboard info for a major PGA tournament.  Generally, we found the entire setup to be very limited when compared to Siri or Googling online.  And the traffic skill was particularly pathetic.  You can put exactly one destination in (ever) and it permanently updates you on that traffic only.  What if you and your husband work in different locations and both want to know about the commute?  And what if you want traffic information to a particular destination on a one-time basis (i.e. airport!).  Nope.  Can't do it.  I hope Amazon (or Google for that matter) can refine the technology because the voice activated tool was a very exciting prospect because neither of us like typing into the phone app when we need something.  But to be useful it has to be more flexible.","Positive"
"6566","Excellent sound quality.  Very happy.  Looking forward to a long and happy relationship.","Positive"
"6567","It has been a lot of fun.  Am looking forward to using it with our Sonos speakers whenever that skill becomes available.","Positive"
"6568","I would give it 5 but need to learn more about it, like it so far, have a light that we turn on with it, just need to get to know it and find out what all it can do.","Positive"
"6569","Thank you my family and I love it","Positive"
"6570","Liking this thing","Positive"
"6571","Pleasantly surprised at the sound quality and volume. Also bought one for my daughter and they love it.","Positive"
"6572","Bought this a couple days after buying the echo dot at Staples, so that should tell you how much I enjoy having the Echo around the house. This one is in my living room and it will fill the house with music or podcasts, no problem. Sound quality is great, build quality is outstanding. If you're on the fence, try out the Echo Dot first (I keep mine on the nightstand next to my bed). Amazon is really on to something with the Echo, and the integrations are wonderful. Can't wait to see what they come up with next.","Positive"
"6573","Great item.","Positive"
"6574","Non stop fun and information.","Positive"
"6575","Great gift for someone who has everything.","Positive"
"6576","No complaints.","Negative"
"6577","Alexa is my new best friend.  I love having the Echo around whenever I need/want information or music.","Positive"
"6578","alexa is awesome","Positive"
"6579","love it","Positive"
"6580","Awesome device.","Positive"
"6581","Love it","Positive"
"6582","My husband (and the whole family) is loving Alexa. There are so many things that it can do. I love being able to change the radio station while cooking :)","Positive"
"6583","Great fun, especially with all of the music available.","Positive"
"6584","I use it on a daily for radio, jokes, commute time, music and control other devices.  My daughter uses it to define words and learn more about topics she is working on at school and home.  I would highly recommend this product.","Positive"
"6585","Was a gift","Positive"
"6586","Love my Echo. Just wish it would respond to something other than Alexa. The reason is, when the commercial for the product comes on TV...well you can guess what happens.","Positive"
"6587","I have had two of these for more than a year now.  It is a nice idea, but in fact it cannot do very much, and what it does requires almost exact syntax.","Positive"
"6588","Can't seem to hear my voice without my raising it!  Except for that we love it!","Positive"
"6589","Always disconnecting from wi-fi,  says it can't locate wi-fi...doesn't seem to be a problem for all our other devices. Pain in the ass product.","Negative"
"6590","we love love love our echo. Bought several for gifts.","Positive"
"6591","Would do it all again. Everyone loves them","Positive"
"6592","love it","Positive"
"6593","Amazing! Buy one now.","Positive"
"6594","I do enjoy my echo.  Voice response - no issues so far.  Use it to play music, news.  Used as an alarm.  Haven't tried to order anything as I prefer a hands on approach to that.  I like it for my needs which are simple.","Positive"
"6595","We are enjoying Alexa very much! I wish she was capable of doing more, though. It would be nice if she could email or text lists and reminders, for example. Hopefully one day!","Positive"
"6596","Love it","Positive"
"6597","This is a great device!!!!  Much more efficient than Siri.  Sound quality is excellent.  I highly recommend this, then add dots in other rooms..... Seems to be more and more ""skills"" added everyday!","Positive"
"6598","The way Amazon has set up the ecosystem, third party providers such as Spotify contract with Amazon to provide plugins. Then, when you want to use the Spotify plugin, you have to give it the right keyword to invoke that plugin, followed by the correct syntax that the Spotify plugin understands.  If you do not do both of those things correctly, your request will fail.  So, for instance, if you are a Spotify customer, you could say ""Alexa, play the playlist Blah from Spotify"",  and that would work, but ""Alexa, play the playlist Blah"" would not work, nor would ""Alexa play Blah from Spotify"", or ""Alexa play Blah"".","Positive"
"6599","Gave as a gift and I think they like it.","Positive"
"6600","Received this as a gift.  Its okay to have glad it was a gift.  You need amazon prime to work the really good features. And I would have given a higher mark if I could stream my personal music on it or I just haven't figured it out yet.  If I do I'll give it another star.","Positive"
"6601","Love it","Positive"
"6602","Bought for my daughter and her family for Christmas. They are all enjoying it, even the kids. Does great at finding music, weather, news, etc. Not so smart regarding encyclopedic knowledge.","Positive"
"6603","Brilliant","Positive"
"6604","Difficult to set-up and I am still working on it. This was a Christmas gift and seems to be a waste of money for so little that is working. There needs to actual instructions step by step on how to set up the applications. My Alexa doesn't answer questions and I am unsure why. VERY Dissatisfied and it is collecting dust.","Negative"
"6605","love it","Positive"
"6606","I bought this for my wife to use in the kitchen and she loves it.  I found it a bit difficult to get going and had to call tech support who were great and helped me get it opperational","Positive"
"6607","I'm in love","Positive"
"6608","The vast majority of questions completely confuse the Echo.  It is cause for celebration when it understands what you are asking and answers correctly.  Most of the time, Google search does a better job.  For instance, the simple question ""Alexa, what are LED lights?"" confuses Alexa, but not Google search.","Positive"
"6609","Fun, great sound quality. We use if as a timer in the kitchen, and to play back music. My wife didn't realise how much see would love this Christmas gift. We also received a couple of echo dots that we have in the bedroom and living room!","Positive"
"6610","Wonderful tool. We think it will be of great value.","Positive"
"6611","Love Alexa!","Positive"
"6612","So glad I purchased. It took me a while to understand everything it can do, but now it's on all the time.","Positive"
"6613","Nice product.  Works well.  Fun and helpful.","Positive"
"6614","Like the voice activated, and the distance (range) it has for listening in other parts of the house.","Positive"
"6615","Can not live with out this.  Very convenient.","Positive"
"6616","Family loves it!","Positive"
"6617","I have so much fun with Alexa easy to use","Positive"
"6618","I am afraid that the poor execution of this product is a reflection of the way that Amazon has chosen to partner with third party providers as a strategy for many of their products.  This unfortunately leaves gaping holes in their solutions.  For instance, with Amazon Drive, they have no actual sync clients, but instead rely on for-profit companies to provide sync clients for them.  This strategy is seen at its most basic level with Amazon Marketplace, where the bulk of items offered for sale are not from Amazon themselves, but from third-party providers that have nothing to do with Amazon.","Negative"
"6619","If you have an Amazon Household Prime account, the Echo loses a lot of functionality. That is, unless you want your calendar events, your to do list, your grocery list to include items from all household members. Echo recognizes that I have my own PROFILE, but I guess that's just for ordering stuff off Amazon.","Negative"
"6620","I also see any requests that any of the household members make and they can see my requests. That's not a big deal for us, but I was a teenager once and would have cared more then. I talked to Amazon customer support and expressed disappointment in the lack of privacy options and they said, ""That's how Households is designed to work."" Wait -- when I purchase a Kindle book, I can say, ""Don't share with the household library.""","Positive"
"6621","Don't they think that each person having their own calendar and to-do list is kinda... common sense? If this gets fixed, I'll rate the Echo much higher but for now, I'm left sorting out how to get the most out of the Echo without inconveniencing my parents by loading up the calendar and to-do list. Hey, if I just wanted to listen to music, that's one thing... but as a personal assistant, well, I count this as a pretty major blunder. I might as well keep using other apps to fulfill these roles. Unfortunately, my main purpose in wanting an Echo was to use it as a personal assistant.","Positive"
"6622","Bought this as a gift. What a terrible disappointment. She doesn't even know what year this is. She cannot even answer the most innocuous questions. If I hadn't discarded the box, etc. it would've gone back.","Positive"
"6623","Bought for daughter, along with an Amazon Echo Dot.  Use Echo in main living areas and Dot in upstairs bedroom.  She absolutely loves them and uses them constantly.","Positive"
"6624","Interesting product! Have also purchased Dot for bedroom.","Positive"
"6625","Unlike the Echo Dot, the echo won't pair with speakers or receiver.  Everyone says the sound from the Echo is so good it's not necessary, but those with hearing disabilities and minimal hearing in the high range it sounds way too base.  It would be nice to be able to send the sound through a receiver and adjust the equalizer, but not possible with this device.  Son-in-law had the Echo Dot and hooked it up through receiver and i was amazed.  He bought me this one for Christmas and I was very disappointed that it would not work through receiver.","Positive"
"6626","Great product !","Positive"
"6627","Honestly it is pretty cool at times when it is working, 9 times out of 10 it will tell you ""Sorry I can't give you an answer to the question."" or it brings up something completely unrelated. Google home is definitely a better product, it was as simple as asking. What does a whale sound like? Google home gives you a whale call, Amazon Echo says ""Splash.""","Positive"
"6628","This is fun a lot of the time but there are DEFINITELY BETTER PRODUCTS out there. I would say for a multi billion dollar organization and with things like Google and Siri this definitely dropped the ball. When searching for podcasts or even songs most of the time it will take you to a song that you didn't even ask about and forget about asking about podcasts it will just tune you in to something you don't like.... If you thumbs down a song or an artist on the echo or tap you think they would stop playing that artist? I hate drake and I thumbs down every one of his songs,  (Alexa, play a station I might like) Here's a station you might like. Drake.. Yeah good job amazon.","Positive"
"6629","Really neat and fun gadget for your home. Some really neat things you can do with it  if you want to get some extra gadgets to go with it. With some other gadgets you can hook it up to your home's lights and you can tell it to turn on the lights in whichever room when you walk in. You can link it with spotify to play songs or playlists off there. And so many other things you can do with it as well.","Positive"
"6630","Very nice . Works well.  My  only complaint is that  you need to use the app a lot(Ex. Alexa, read me  my shopping  list"" - ""you can find your list  in the app"")  and it seems it doesn't answer questions in as much detail as well(Ex. ""Alexa, what is  the temperature  outside now"", and you hear the day's forecast instead). I will admit I haven't worked with it a lot yet.","Positive"
"6631","Good price, easy order.","Positive"
"6632","I seriously love my amazon echo! I bought mine used but it was in perfect condition. It literally does anything google can do and more. And the speaker is one of the best speakers I've ever bought for how small it is. if you've been debating on getting this just do it seriously you won't regret it","Positive"
"6633","Easy to set up and use, can't wait to see what else she will be able to do in the future.  I already have her working with our Nest thermostat, 2 wemo wall plugs and the harmony companion remote with hub.  I have also subscribed to Amazon Music Unlimited and have listened to more music over the last few weeks than I have in ages.  Good Quality speaker, glad I bought this over the dot.  It's strangely comforting to have another 'being' in the house, a bit like having a pet around.","Positive"
"6634","I haven't hooked this up to any smart devices in my home yet, but I like that I have the ability to do so. My daughter has also enjoyed asking Alexa to tell her jokes (and thankfully hasn't discovered the ability to order anything from it yet!). I'm able to quickly find out the weather forecast, listen to music, get recipes, etc. I received it as a Christmas gift and would definitely recommend it.","Positive"
"6635","I love my Echo!","Positive"
"6636","Great sound and awesome gift!","Positive"
"6637","We like this a lot.  Still growing with it.","Positive"
"6638","love it makes life too easy","Positive"
"6639","I love my amazon ECHO!","Positive"
"6640","Love this way more than I should. It's fun to shout various songs across the house and like an obedient robot she does my command.","Positive"
"6641","Can not relieve answers for simple questions. This product fails.","Negative"
"6642","Works great still leaning All The thing's that it can do . There is a real learning curve with this item . but I'm sure I'll be Happy with My purchase .","Positive"
"6643","We love the way the echo plays music but as far as questions go she's like Siri's dumber cousin!","Positive"
"6644","Love the music.","Positive"
"6645","I love it!  I think every household should have one.  I will admit, it takes awhile for Alexi to get smart by loading different apps etc. but within a week her intelligence, music selections and fun have expanded tremendously.","Positive"
"6646","too bad, it doesn't work internationally","Negative"
"6647","I can see the potential but do not like the complicated fashion by which one has to add skills through an app on a separate device, which often can only be done after registering on yet another website using an internet browser.. too much run around. I was excited that there are translator skills... none of them work. This device still has a long way to go...","Positive"
"6648","if you dont expect the world and use her mor menial tasks and entertainment she is wonderful.","Negative"
"6649","love it","Positive"
"6650","Having said that, in general we feel that Alexa is not as knowledgeable or intuitive as Siri. Alexa would also benefit from a little more personality.","Positive"
"6651","Good job Alexa....","Positive"
"6652","She's great for music but can never seem to find answers for my questions. I should have gotten ok Google!","Positive"
"6653","We love our Alexa!  great addition to our household. Sound quality is terrific and the voice command is so convenient and fun!  Well worth the purchase price!","Positive"
"6654","Been using it for a year.  Truly a wonderful little gizmo to have around.  And we just love calling her names.","Positive"
"6655","Great functions","Positive"
"6656","it needs to be as smart as google","Positive"
"6657","Works as advertised except is not very good at searching the internet for information. I thought I would be able to ask it questions and it would look them up on the internet for me. If I had not already purchased this I would consider getting the new Google device instead. However overall I do like this product. The speaker is good and I like that it links to my Amazon music account. I also find the app on my cell phone to be somewhat cumbersome. I hope they continue to work on the software. Specifically I would like to see more options to organize my tasks and shopping lists.","Positive"
"6658","What is there not to love???  Maybe the fact that she startled me now and then by listening in too closely.","Positive"
"6659","Love it, like a whole new world.","Positive"
"6660","Good product, I have not been able to use it to fullness since I could not download the app for control","Positive"
"6661","Alexa is good but a little stiff. She could plug into the internet better instead of saying I don't know.","Positive"
"6662","Gave for Christmas gift they loved it might get one for myself","Positive"
"6663","Hard time hooking up to pandora, poor directions. Cannot connect to Apple Music library. Echo says it can't find this library. Whole house hookup would be great, but you have buy extra expensive gizmos.","Negative"
"6664","I really love it, but I understand that for those of us with at least one Echo device the price would be $3.99 per month for Amazon Unlimited Music????","Positive"
"6665","We love Alexa, Tap and Dot... yup we have them all and use them daily. We stream music, we make shopping lists and get the weather. I even place an Amazon order from time to time. We traveled South for a few months and they made the trip with us. We have friends using them and they love them. I am a baby boomer in love with the easy access this gives us to music of all kinds, Tap lets us bring that to out deck area, Bluetooth lets us crank it up to Bluetooth enabled speakers. And our grandson loves a good joke!! Alexa has so many uses she is much appreciated in our home. Thank you Amazon!","Positive"
"6666","Purchase my Echo from Best Buy and used app to setup everything without a problem........","Positive"
"6667","...until app continually keep asking me to setup Echo; However, when Alexia chooses to hear me, I asked, ""Alexia are you connected to the Internet?"" She replies, Yes..... but, app loops for another setup. Now this contraption doesn't hear me-will not respond to voice commands. After researching and discovering a lot of other people also having this same problem it's just not me. $179.00 is a lot of money and I cannot afford to waste it. I was so hoping this device would work.","Positive"
"6668","Device doesn't understand when I say, Alexa. Changed name to Echo and problem solved.","Negative"
"6669","Love my echo.","Positive"
"6670","Awesome product","Positive"
"6671","After buying the Echo I quickly purchased three Dots. My whole house is now Alexa'd, and it's awesome. Alexa responds quickly, and correctly nearly all the time, so much more accurate than Siri. 5 Stars. Great product!","Positive"
"6672","Great product that my family has really enjoyed using. From the music playlists, weather, news, shopping, order tracking, and the questions my daughter asks, Alexa has really fit into our home.","Positive"
"6673","I thought it could turn on and off my cable TV.  No such luck.","Positive"
"6674","It was a gift to someone else.","Positive"
"6675","I got a dot first. Got the Echo, because sometimes the dot is not loud/good enough to listen to music. But really, the improvement is incremental, and when the Echo is at a volume that the Dot cannot achieve, it stops being able to do voice recognition. Thinking I might have better (and more cheaply) gotten two extra dots - one for the kitchen. You can never have enough dots. And adding a remote speaker to the dot allows louder volume while still being able to do voice control.","Positive"
"6676","Echo or Dot, Alexa is a bit developmentally challenged. There are a few things she does well, like providing hands-free control of lights on/off in individual rooms, playing audible books. Some things she does ok, like reading kindle books. Most things, it's just useless. I even wrote some of my own apps, but even that has too many limitations. Still some growing to do.","Positive"
"6677","Love it!","Positive"
"6678","Great product!","Positive"
"6679","I have purchased 3 Echo Dots, so It's obvious that I like the concept.","Positive"
"6680","I decided to purchase the original echo (the re-furbished version costs 3X the Dot) in the hopes that it would produce richer sound.","Positive"
"6681","So awesome! Totally love it! Always learning new things about it  and I really appreciate how often Amazon sends me emails about new Alexa updates and new features on how to utilize Alexa.  I often wonder what I did before I had an Alexa.","Positive"
"6682","The sound is, at best, marginally better.  So, my advice is to skip the Echo, but the Dot an save the $100.","Positive"
"6683","The voice recognition could, and most likely will, be improved. It finds my Spotify music on the first try perhaps 70% of the time. It's great as an alarm clock, a radio, and a news and weather reporter -- a bit less helpful for internet research, since it supports only basic searches.","Positive"
"6684","Sounds good, my problem with is is that Also have the echo dot and I have to shout when I am 15 feet away to get this to hear me while no music is playing. When I use my Normal voice, the echo that is in 15 feet away and unobstructed by walls will not hear me while the echo dot that is in my bedroom 50 feet away will hear me and respond. I am not impressed with this flaw. Maybe it is just the unit I got?","Negative"
"6685","love it!","Positive"
"6686","Great for listening to music","Positive"
"6687","Bought the Echo for my wife as a Christmas gift. She is still learning what Alexa can do , but really enjoying it!","Positive"
"6688","Our entire family lives Alexa! She quickly became the favorite go to for random questions or jokes. When we entertain guest love the ability to call out for a particular song.  BEST  Christmas gift this year<f0><U+009F><U+008E><U+0084><f0><U+009F><U+008E><U+0081>","Positive"
"6689","fast and good","Positive"
"6690","thx it halp me a lot","Positive"
"6691","I was so excited and used this daily, until ot broke after having it for a month. Literally just stopped responding. I'm waiting for a replacement as we speak.","Positive"
"6692","Love, love, love my Alexa - her speakers are great and she's portable with the add on battery pack. The thing I would say is that they need to work on her understanding questions better and being able to work with an iPad, etc. With that said, I wouldn't give mine for anything","Positive"
"6693","Purchased it for my son in law for Christmas and he was thrilled!","Positive"
"6694","Amazing!! I love to listen to music, and the speakers on this are incredible! But just as a forewarning  it is better to have amazon prime with this product since it gets all the music off of amazon and if you have prime, then all the music is free","Positive"
"6695","Okay, I don't mean to sound like one of those people who goes overboard over a product, BUT I LOVE THIS!!","Positive"
"6696","I hesitated to buy this for a long time, as far as I could see, it was just an overpriced speaker. Boy was I wrong.","Negative"
"6697","I have purchased thousands of items from Amazon (no exaggeration) but I think this ranks among my top 5 favorite.","Positive"
"6698","That review with the photo of the the guy hugging his Alexa is right on the nose.","Positive"
"6699","I think if I had a fire and had to rush out of my house, I would grab my keys, my wallet and my Alexa. No kidding.","Positive"
"6700","Very very disappointed with this product. After ordering this as a Christmas gift and not getting it until over two weeks after Christmas, I plugged it in and nothing. I'm so upset about this and wishing now I had ordered a Google Home instead.","Negative"
"6701","We love our echo!  There are so many things to do with it, you would not believe!  We are now texting and answering calls with Echo.  We constantly have the radio on and of course the Echo is of so much use.  From Jokes to rejecting phone call, this technology is amazing.","Positive"
"6702","Fun to play with and use!","Positive"
"6703","Love it!","Positive"
"6704","Have one at home bought two as gifts! They were a big hit...","Positive"
"6705","Love using Alexa!  She plays music, helps create shopping lists, and also quick answers to all of our random questions.  She is also great at telling jokes!","Positive"
"6706","it's fine for simple things but it can't google anything to answer","Positive"
"6707","I have to say Im a tech addict and have lots of tech tablets, PCs ive built and blutooth, as well as smart TVs.  That said where ive compared Google and Amazon for their tablets and tech Ive found something interesting.  Amazon is better in doing what they do and because of the massive collection of books, music and movies...my Prime acct is something i value highly!  Echo was bought for a Xmas gift to myself.  So far ive testes weather daily, had her read my books at nite even if i feel like falling asleep to when i feel im drifting off..I say, ""Alexa, stop.""  I ask what the deals on Amazon are for Echo owners.  I ask what ""skills"" are available for Alexa and Ive taken advantage of the free holiday reading such as ""The Night Before Christmas."" When it was offered just for holiday until 12/31 which i thought was very nice.  I play my music and made a Christmas Playlist of classics everybody really loved and got in the spirit for the holiday.  The build on Echo is solid!  Heavy in hand, nice dim diode on back side where power chord plugs in.  Discrete plug-in adapter just like our Kindle Fire tablets..no monster power brick.  Voice recognition is good and i have a lg bedroom.  I like the idea that tons of more features will be added ea year and that this wont get legacy in 4 yrs like just about everything Microsoft or Google puts out.  Finally, backing up to my comparison to Google tech, I still have 2012 Kindle Fire 8.9"" and i have 2 Google Android tables, the Nexus 7 and ASUS Transformer TF700 and its new keyboard.  Now the ASUS especially was a beautiful pc of tech in 2012 but thanks to ASUS never offering any Android OS updates after Lollipop it got slower and slower and its in MINT cond.  Ive reformatted and everything, ive got super fast wifi and its a royal pain to use.  Same thing even worse with the first Google Nexus 7..whats happened is that Google keeps forcing updates of its newest OS which is killing the older RAM and brain in the poor things.  I got the Google Nexus 5 cell as well and guess what, it died first the wifi unit in the thing next it couldnt access internet nothing.  Between the OS force which keeps nagging on the unit til you update or accidentally hit the button and it updates on you..and the sluggish performance on Google tech as it ages...I have to say that Amazon tech remained unphased and kept chugging along, speedier than Google tech.  Silk browser isnt bothering the tablets for constant updates and rendering the tech dead.  This is why i enthusiastically recommend anything Amazon over Google.  This Echo is top notch.  Even the rubberized chords for everything they put out is sturdy and top notch, design is very nice too.  Cases and accessories fit like a glove and as new models come in Amazon gives great pricing on old accessories whether theyre for tablets or i imagine these new pcs of tech: Echo, Dot, etc.  I cant say enough and Im not getting something free here either to review.  Im a tech geek who is just trying to help those noobies out there considering going towards the Amazon or the Google version of this.  Both have major portals and offerings but guarenteed, Google will keep forcing things which bog and break down the equipment you buy.  Im still using my wonderfully working Kindle Fire 8.9"" tablet of 2012 and ive put the Google Nexus 7 and ASUS Transformer TF700 up for sale.  Its too bad because Google could easily build an opt out for legacy equip to not have to upgrade its Android OS but it wont and the moment some poor sucker hits upgrade...its so over.  Youve got a paper weight.  My $400 unlocked Google cell phone after 4 yrs died and now sits as a reminder...cant get on internet...others complained and i saw it was a big problem for many owners.","Positive"
"6708","lots of fun, which i could connect it to other speakers","Positive"
"6709","Love it!!","Positive"
"6710","Who doesn't love their Echo?  I was really surprised by the sound quality and the responsiveness of the voice recognition.  Only wish we could configure multiple Echo & Dot devices in the same household as a wireless music system.","Positive"
"6711","life changer. I sleep like a baby w the rain feature on loop. checking traffic is also a daily use.","Positive"
"6712","Really useful at home.  Siri is nice, but I've gotten far more value out of Alexa!  Shopping list feature is great, music is great (costs extra), asking for weather is great, setting times is great.  It just makes so many little things better and easier","Positive"
"6713","love it","Positive"
"6714","For what ever reason - product update or failing electronics - my two year old Echo quit connecting to wireless.  All operations trying to reset the device came to a crawl.  The device may have not been built to last more then two years but at $200 I would expect more.  Stuck now with a door stop I guess.  Have several Echo Dots which I think are a better investment if the devices will only last 2 years.","Positive"
"6715","Not as robust as I anticipated.  I am still leaning what it and isn't capable of doing.","Positive"
"6716","So far so good.  Needed a source for music and this has supplied it.  Works very well.","Positive"
"6717","My wife loves it!","Positive"
"6718","My kids LOVE this!!","Positive"
"6719","Alexa is amazing!","Positive"
"6720","Google Has a better product! In my opinion!","Positive"
"6721","fun to use!","Positive"
"6722","obtrusive device!","Negative"
"6723","Got this for the wife and she loves it and so do the kids. I was surprised at how many cool things this can do, very happy with it especially with the black Friday discount we got on it!","Positive"
"6724","Seems like you are talking to a person.  Once you get the skills loaded its fun to use.","Positive"
"6725","I had wanted an Echo for a couple of years now, so I finally bought one and I love it!!  Bought an Echo Dot for my office, but I haven't been able to get it connected.","Positive"
"6726","love it","Positive"
"6727","Doesn'the know alot and you have to ask in a very specific way before she understands.  When you go to google and ask, it always has answers.  Hope she learns more without being soooo  specific","Positive"
"6728","I bought this on Prime Day on the recommendation of a friend.  It's great.  I have it in my living room and use it for music, timers, random questions, you name it.  I don't have any familiarity with competing products, but this led me to buy an echo dot as well.","Positive"
"6729","Awesome. I like it most because I can just speak to it in plain english!","Positive"
"6730","This thing is so fun.  I look forward to when they make the AI smarter.","Positive"
"6731","It's amazing!","Positive"
"6732","Have really enjoyed my Amazon Echo.  Alexa gives me the latest headlines, weather, and even a joke every morning.  What a great way to start the day.  She has even helped me find songs that I didn't know the name.  She is amazing.  I am still learning all of her abilities.  I am also going to use Alexa to reorder some products.  I am so happy that she is here.","Positive"
"6733","does not have important function like intercom and ability to make a phone call using skype.","Positive"
"6734","I still have not been able to make it work, however, I have been busy trying to get my other work done.  This is something I really want, but I do not have the time to give it to get it to work.  When I had the time, I could get it to play music, but it could not understand how to do anything else I asked it to do.","Positive"
"6735","I only bought one Echo device for my kitchen/dinning space to help me entertain. Her speaker really fills the room compared to the echo dots.","Positive"
"6736","The moment you say her name, she's listening. Her range and ability to hear us out really feels good. I have spoken to her from across a room while someone else (in-between me and the device) is playing games on their speakers, talking to their friends on Discord, without issue. You can ask her a variety of questions (When is the next Superbowl? When is the next Green Bay Packers Game? What is the weather? Who let the dogs out?) and she seems to always have a response. If there is something she doesn't know, you can look to expand her skills with the Alexa App. This app is fairly easy to use, though the interface could be smoother (navigating is a tad clunky). I already added skills such as LIFX to control my lights and honestly - this is really fun.","Positive"
"6737","Now, Alexa isn't perfect. I have ran into a few odd things that I do hope Amazon will someday address. For example:","Positive"
"6738","Having all of my smart devices (such as lights and TVs) plugged in and on so that I may control turning them on and off with apps and Alexa works great - until the power goes out at 5am. The moment the power returned, all my lights, TV, and even Alexa turned on. There may be a solution to this, but I will need to explore (such as setting schedules and having the devices check the schedule when powered back on). Until then, I fear power outages.","Positive"
"6739","Alexa is always listening. If anyone says her name (TV commercial, Radio, a friend on Discord, TWITCH) she will respond. Being able to customize her name to Echo or Amazon instead doesn't fix the issue either. Having a custom name so that she really becomes ""my"" household device would really alleviate this. I do understand there are issues with people creating their own custom names, but even Alexa sometimes doesn't hear her name correctly and she will randomly jump into conversations picking up on phrases we can't quite figure out.","Negative"
"6740","Combine the above issue with an accidental command to purchase (ie: News reporting a cute story about how a little girl accidentally purchased a dollhouse and then saying how funny they though it was that ""Alexa, ordered me a dollhouse""). In just explaining the story to a friend over Skype I even accidentally triggered their device to try to order a dollhouse! Luckily you can turn ordering off or add a pass code, but caution that this is not the default.","Positive"
"6741","Honestly though, that's about all I take issue with. The way Alexa allows me to command my devices through voice is really a new and fun experience. I really look forward to how this device will grow as smart homes become more popular.","Positive"
"6742","Alexa is amazing. Every day I discover new things she can do. It's crazy cool.","Positive"
"6743","This is my second echo and I just love this. Every morning my family starts its day off with Alexa be it asking for the news or traffic updates. We have our living room lights connected through a Wink. I do wish there was a way to block explicit lyrics during songs.","Positive"
"6744","First one was black.  The white looks nice and works the same.","Positive"
"6745","christmas for my son he loves Alexa and she has a great sense of humor","Positive"
"6746","Great , easy to use. I'm 64 and struggle with anything computer. This is so easy just talk ti it. Play so music, sets timers just love it<U+2764><U+2764><U+2764><U+2764><U+2764>","Positive"
"6747","Amazing, cannot get enough of Alexa. Even on bad mornings, i can just ask alexa to tell me a joke and she does. Corny as they may be, I still start my day with a smile..","Positive"
"6748","Love it!","Positive"
"6749","Its a gadget, and doesn't understand much. You need to learn a special ECHO Dictionary!","Positive"
"6750","Love the Echo, so easy to play music and find general information.  Highly recommend this item.  We love it so much, we are getting the Dot another area of our home.","Positive"
"6751","I love my Alexa. Shopping and to do lists are so handy. Great speaker. Very fun product.","Positive"
"6752","LOVE.","Positive"
"6753","It's absolutely magical!  And I am guessing that I only know 10% of what it can do!","Positive"
"6754","Don't trust it,wish I could return it.always Glenn","Positive"
"6755","Love, love, love! Does so much more than expected. Wish Alexa would say Your Welcome when I say thank you though, haha.","Positive"
"6756","So far I am pleased with the Echo.  I am still learning about all the uses I can put it to.  I would like to know where I can find a guide to all the free apps that will work on the Echo.","Positive"
"6757","Love the product but Alexa has a lot to learn. My sons Google Home understand more commands.","Positive"
"6758","My Echo is great. The only thing about it that I don't like is that for any non-Amazon created Alexa Skills you enable, you have to remember which commands you're supposed to use to open those skills. Maybe this will get easier the more I use it but for now, I find myself having to open the Alexa app and look up the commands for what I'm trying to do.","Positive"
"6759","Very interesting addition to the household!  Very good with music requests.","Positive"
"6760","Fun and functional.","Positive"
"6761","I am returning the Echo because we cannot download the app.  We have talked to your customer support and they were unable to help as well.  I spent a whole day trying to set it up and called in a computer tech for $75 an hour and he could not get it working either.","Positive"
"6762","Love it, Use it for my detail business","Positive"
"6763","My brother had one and I loved it. Wanted my own","Positive"
"6764","not as useful as I thought it would be.","Positive"
"6765","Love this product works great still learning thanks","Positive"
"6766","Voice commands to play my Pandora music among all the other things it does. I love it!","Positive"
"6767","My Dad loves it","Positive"
"6768","A must have.  I love how easy the set up was.  It connects to our Honeywell Wi-Fi thermostat and it's great being able to tell it to turn the thermostat up or down.  The sound quality is phenomenal.  We have ours in the main part of the house and then we have an echo.in our bedroom.  Next, we are going to purchase the outlets and light switches that work with Alexa.","Positive"
"6769","Love it","Positive"
"6770","We love <U+2764><U+FE0F>","Positive"
"6771","Best thing bought. Glad got it on sale.","Positive"
"6772","Item is great but amazon lowered the price while I eas waiting gir tge item to be shipped and wouldn't adjust the payment.","Negative"
"6773","This only gets one star cause it broke after a year. I unplugged it to move stuff around and replug it and it doesn't work anymore. I tried to contact warranty, but they weren't helpful.","Positive"
"6774","Was a gift, my son loves it!","Positive"
"6775","love it","Positive"
"6776","i got this for my granddaughter, she and her parents and her brother love it.i'm sure once they realize its full potential, they will like it even more.","Positive"
"6777","I am not sure how I have survived to this point without Alexa. Now, I would suggest that you never, never ask her for a fart. Having teens, this never gets old...for them. I use the shopping list and music functions the most.","Positive"
"6778","Works prefectly!","Positive"
"6779","Having a lot of fun with this. I plan on doing a lot with it","Positive"
"6780","It's cool but it's hard to use. Doesn't have to much info on her yet. Maybe with time it gets better","Positive"
"6781","What can one say about the Echo that has not been already written? I decided to give myself one for Christmas, and I am glad I purchased it on Black Friday; had I waited much longer, they would have been sold out for Christmas Delivery. I am still learning all the wondrous things Alexa can do, and I must say it is a lot of fun! Being a Prime member, I am enjoying access to Prime Music, and I am currently trying out the Unlimited Music. Not sure if I will ever use Alexa to control things like garage doors, sprinklers, etc., but I am quite happy with this product so far.","Positive"
"6782","Love the Alexa.","Positive"
"6783","Bought the Echo for my husband and he loves it!","Positive"
"6784","Christmas present for my wife.  She says it doesn't do much, but I think it will in the long run.  A very good present.  Happy with Anazon,","Positive"
"6785","Very entertaining and informative !","Positive"
"6786","Love my Alexa but sometimes curse her. I purposefully have her the other room. If I set the alarm, I yell Alexa snooze, she thinks I say news, she starts reading the news which annoys me into awake, and problem solved, I'm out of bed. Lol","Negative"
"6787","awesome!","Positive"
"6788","This is a lot of fun. And the sound quality is great! I wish it had more songs, but they are being added all the time. Already, I was surprised to find some rather rare ones.","Positive"
"6789","One amusing thing: I regularly watch RT television news, and there's a field news reporter named Alexei Yaroshevsky. When he signs off. ""Alexei Yaroshevsky, reporting from Baghdad for RT news,"" my Alexa answers saying the request can't be accommodated. I get a laugh out of that when it happens.","Positive"
"6790","I'm very glad I bought this.","Positive"
"6791","disappointed. after ""training"" still have to ask multiple times to wake. when presented with simple multiplication problem  response is ""hmmm. can't seem to find the answer"". very frustrating. can't find music. DONE","Negative"
"6792","I don't feel Alexa is very smart.  There is a lot she does not know and a lot of questions she claims to not understand.  I expected more.","Positive"
"6793","Christmas gift! My boyfriend loves it!","Positive"
"6794","Works great, very helpfull in turning lights on/off and all of the tasks that can be done with your voice without fumbling for remotes or phone.","Positive"
"6795","Other than that Alexa is great with radio stations. It's not easy to turn the volume up and down without your phone or turn the sound off if you have it loud. The jokes are awesome.","Positive"
"6796","Love it!!!","Positive"
"6797","I received Echo as a Christmas present.  I subsequently ordered Dot for my living room.  Now that I have had time to test the functionalities, here is my input.  Hopefully the folks at Amazon Echo team will read this and make the following feature improvements.","Positive"
"6798","1. Lack of equalizer (bass/mid/treble are all absent):  This is not acceptable, considering the price of full Echo speaker, and the fact that it had 2 years to mature as a product.  If you look at products like Vizio Crave 360, while it may not be a ""smart"" device, it does have very nice thumping sound for being a cylinder speaker.  I would imagine this equalizer function can be added with a software update.","Positive"
"6799","2. ""Skills???!!!"":  If you ask Google Home any question, the device will literally Google everything for you.  Instead, for Echo devices, you have to add ""skills"" to enhance its functionality.  ....What???  I was hoping that devices like Echo will already come with all the common skills.  BTW, most of the ""skills"" are garbage.  I don't know about you, but I am more interested in this device knowing the answers to the practical questions, than telling me about baseball trivia.  And many ""skills"" published for Alexa has 1 star ratings.  They literally look like someone picked up a coding manual and coded them.  As I mentioned earlier, Echo had 2 years of product maturity time, yet in so many ways, it lacks.","Positive"
"6800","One thing I will call out, Echo has bluetooth.  You can find a bluetooth sound bar and stream music via bluetooth, which Google Home doesn't have.","Positive"
"6801","3. It can't Google: If you ask Alexa if she can Google things, she will tell you she can Bing things for you.  OK, so why can't she give me a meatloaf recipe, if she can connect to Bing?  I don't really care for that.  Amazon, please make your own search engine, or fine-tune Bing search capability.  If this device can provide all the answers to our questions via Google or Bing, it would be a worthy competitor to Google Home.","Positive"
"6802","Now that I got the negatives out of the way, I do think Echo still has the upperhand when it comes to connected home.  Recently, I purchased TP Link smart switch and connected my lamp.  Now with the verbal command, I can have Alexa turn on/off lights in my bedroom.  I also connected my Echo Dot to my home sound system by bluetooth.","Negative"
"6803","My next connected home experience will be thermostat.  Overall, Echo is a product that is already matured, but there is still room for tons of improvements.  I really wish that the folks at Amazon will make those updates and make this product very competitive to Google Home.","Positive"
"6804","good .  room for improvement.","Positive"
"6805","Great for music and any other questions you might have","Positive"
"6806","Never sassy, takes orders well, always delivers","Positive"
"6807","would be better if it also had audio out like the dot.","Positive"
"6808","Wow... just wow!!!","Positive"
"6809","When I asked for this for Christmas my husband was like, ""Really?  You want what?""  Well, he has totally changed his tune.  We use Alexa for weather updates, game scores, the news, ordering food, ordering groceries, converting measurements, changing the temperature, and my personal favorite - playing music!  Ask for her to play a song.  ANY song and she will.  It's awesome!","Positive"
"6810","who doesn't love echo. I have 2 of them","Positive"
"6811","So far I'm very happy with alexa! Everyone loves the music and grocery list options and the timers mostly. I haven't explored too many other functions yet but hopefully will soon!","Positive"
"6812","I have now bought three of these for family members. Bought one for my granddaughters' birthdays  to share and heard that they were always fighting over it. So their parents worked it out with them so they could each have it for a month at a time. They even bring it into the bathroom when they shower! Needless to say I added another one to their household for Christmas. Also bought one for my daughter for the holidays and she had it up and running before she was done with lunch.","Positive"
"6813","My husband laughs at me when I ask Alexa a question and she responds...he says I get the look of a child who did something wonderful on my face.  Yeah, so what...I like Alexa and she's awesome!  Still adding new skills, but she's been great so far at answer questions, adding to my lists and making life easier...no more googling for this gal when it's a simple question I can ask Alexa.  Funny, I find myself being so polite to her...I almost feel like I should offer her a cup of coffee...so I did.  See what her response is.","Positive"
"6814","The speaker is way better than I expected!  I love listening to 80s and she easily puts in on to all 80s.  Need to purchase a music plan for larger selections, but it's a great way to fill the house with music when it's too quiet or I am cooking.","Positive"
"6815","Sound is great! Still needs improvement in hearing and understanding but they say the product grows as it develops. I'm pretty satisfied, especially playing my music.","Positive"
"6816","Perfect gift for my college daughter, she loved it!!","Positive"
"6817","I'm not a Google fanboy, nor did I have anything against Bing...until now.","Positive"
"6818","We were playing with our new Echo by asking Alexa a number of things we'd normally ask Google.  Most of which came back with ""I don't know what you're asking"".  Echo was able to play most music and answer simple questions about store hours, weather, etc., but since Bing lacks the ability to learn users' search habits, so does Alexa.","Negative"
"6819","Good Buy!","Positive"
"6820","So far so good, got it on New Years of 2017 so have not set everything up yet, just the basics and it works pretty well for now. I will rewrite a review in about 30-60 days to give a more detailed pros and cons list. Just to say one thing so far, the set up to Wifi and such was very easy and simple and the speaker for music is pretty good, but with very little bass.","Positive"
"6821","Love alexia, I use it mostly to play classical music for my 8 dogs it keeps them calm.","Positive"
"6822","I brought this for my fianc for Christmas and he loves it . We are listening to music on it all the time and it's great to know the weather forecast when I get up in the am. It seems to answer all questions easily and so far it's been a very nice addition to our home. To note it fits nicely on the entertainment system and looks like part of it which is esthetically pleasing ..","Positive"
"6823","Bought two, one for our first floor, one for the second.  It is so addicting talking to Alexa, and having her control our smart house items!  Her random facts are pretty entertaining and she really does know and help with a lot!","Positive"
"6824","Love the options for music etc!","Positive"
"6825","It would be nice to have more features.","Positive"
"6826","Amazon Echo is an amazing product that will revolutionize the smart home. Alexa is smart and powerful. She can answer questions, tell you what you have to do, read you a book, play a song...","Positive"
"6827","If you are into tech, like music, or want to upgrade your home, you need amazon Echo.","Positive"
"6828","I might be like you if you are reading this. A gadget guy. Or maybe a techie? Or an early adopter, perhaps? That's me!","Positive"
"6829","But for any or YOUR reasons, this little guy might be more of the way an entertainment piece than it is a necessity. yeah. It can be useful for some daily functions. And it can really be darn entertaining at times... But I returned it. And this is why.","Positive"
"6830","I purchased it as a gift for my parents. They are none of the aforementioned and they are only interested in technology if they do not have to learn something new and they can see it make their life simpler. ... So that pretty much rules out most any form of new technology, unfortunately. But I figured that all they have to do is talk to it. ""No buttons, mom!"" ""And you can say this..."" ""And it will reply, ....that...""","Positive"
"6831"," But as much as I tried to convince them of it; they only saw it as a gift that was to expensive to find real use for it on a daily basis.","Positive"
"6832"," For you and me, perhaps, we would. I like so many things about this little device. But I returned it. Simply because I didn't need one for my place. I already have other technology that serves me fine to do the similar things I need without keeping it for my self.","Positive"
"6833","I also think this is a technology that is going to be much more useful in the future. However, there is a lot of development that has to get there for me to reconsider. But I believe we will get there in time...","Positive"
"6834","Our entire family has been enjoying this gift!","Positive"
"6835","Using it every day . Having fun","Positive"
"6836","Fun my grandchildren are having a ball w/ it. Sound is pretty good.","Positive"
"6837","A must have product. Wakes me up, plays my songs, everything u can think of. Worth every penney invested. Love it. Thanks..","Positive"
"6838","The Echo is now the goto device in our house for music, news, weather and general info. Will slowly incorporate it into smart home products as time goes on. Great Product !!!!","Positive"
"6839","Love this Echo! Works great!","Positive"
"6840","Very useful ""personal assistant"". I enjoy using my echo every day and have become quite dependent on it for news, weather, and other useful information. Am thinking about buying another one.","Positive"
"6841","Alexa is awesome!","Positive"
"6842","The Alexa service is great but I'm rating the Echo here.  Setting up the Echo is the most frustrating experience I've had in 25 years of IT.  I have 2 Echo's and 2 Echo Dot's.  The Echo Dot is not as bad probably because its the latest Echo with a newer radio or better antenna.  For both Echo's it took about a half hour of starting, stopping, resetting, rebooting, unplugging and starting all over again.  I finally got it to pair with my router when it was literally inches away from it even through I had a full strength WiFi signal on my phone.  After pairing the device with my WiFi network I moved the device to a location I actually want to use it and it can't reach the WiFi network, this time about 20 feet from the hub which has 2.5ghz and 5ghz radios and supports Wireless A, G, N and AC.","Positive"
"6843","I love my echo. I listen to it every morning and night. I'm thinking of taking it to work with me! I take it from room to room. Especially like to listen to relaxation station to fall asleep. And when I am soaking in the bath I like piano music. I listen to artists I have heard of but never got to hear their music. Over the holidays, one night I listened to White Christmas by 12 different singers.  Alexa understands me very well and it doesn't take long to catch on to  how to phrase questions so she understands.","Positive"
"6844","ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS! AND THE FACT That you get emails with all the new in app technology: AKA Home skills, thrive, etc. etc.","Positive"
"6845","I have convinced 4 people to buy one since I received mine a couple weeks ago! My son has the dot, and it is perfect for him, and now he is learning the new things he can do with Alexa.","Positive"
"6846","You need to add another star!  I love my Echo","Positive"
"6847","It is amazing and fun to use. My toddler loves it!","Positive"
"6848","We use it all the time, works really well","Positive"
"6849","Decent EQ and very loud. Fun to play with.","Positive"
"6850","Amazon echo is SO much fun. She speaks at a great volume and can go so loud! Very pleased with this purchase.","Positive"
"6851","is it expensive? yes. is it worth it and totally bada**? also yes. Heard the government might be listening though.","Negative"
"6852","AWESOME!!","Positive"
"6853","Oooooohhhhhhhh  Myyyyyyy! Alexander it like my cyber room mate, lol no seriously. We always listen to music from pandora, her news briefings are amazing, her jokes sometimes are like for kids and are really dumb but scientifically are so well put together your like that was stupid but pretty good lol. She sets alarms so I don't burn down my new apartment........ again, lol omg, ok she wakes me up and you can even choose famous celebrity voices like Alic Baldwin as your wake up tone and so many more. She tells you what movies are playing and has more features than the amount of hair on me head and I have thick long hair lol.","Positive"
"6854","My 88-yr-old mom likes it because she can change radio stations with her voice. Sound OK.","Positive"
"6855","My husband loves Echo and Alexa as do I. I even have him listening to the free meditation at bedtime!","Positive"
"6856","Where to start.  Was excited to get the Amazon Echo.  After finally figuring out the exact way you need to say something and how specific you need to be to get her to do anything I honestly kind of hate it.  I have a Nest, just one, like most people who have a Nest I would imagine.  I am supposed to first enable the skill via the app (why my phone needs to control Echo is beyond me), which I did, and you do not have to repeat, so thats just an annoyance but fine, ill get over it.  It is explained that I need to say ""Alexa, ask Nest to turn the heat up in the Living Room (Where my Nest is at), half the time she searches Bing (The only supported search engine which seems very inferior to many others), and then tells me she either cant find what I am looking for, or basically she did not understand.  I understand Echo is new and has A LONG way to go to even be a decent product, but come on Amazon.  I try to explain my frustrations to Echo ""Alexa"" in hopes she would relay the message to Amazon so they could fix it and it could eventually become easier to use, but no, she decides to search Bing, which leaves me more frustrated and I have been known to say ""Alexa you're a *****"", or something along those lines, but she says ""thats not very nice to say"", really, leaving me even more aggravated! Anyone who has ever used ""Hey Siri"" on an Iphone should understand that is rather user friendly, Echo is not.  I would really appreciate Amazon reaching out to me to help fix the problem. You can submit an explanation on ""did Alexa do what you wanted"", you can click (yes click, because you can only do this via the app) yes or no, and then you can write a comment if you want, and then ask to be contacted, which is ALWAYS a generic email stating they appreciate the feedback, I do not really care if you appreciate the feedback Amazon, I care if you use the feedback and try to fix Echo's issues, which to date still do not work.  Amazon I tried, and I regret.  The only good thing about Echo is that I am the first person I know to have one, which makes me feel pretty cool, but at the same time, maybe everyone else decided to go with Google, which I am probably going to do if Amazon cannot make this worth the money I spent.","Positive"
"6857","We love our Alexa! One of the greatest gifts I ever bought myself<U+2764><U+FE0F>","Positive"
"6858","So far it's ok. I've had some problems playing music. Initially I was able to ask Alexa to play a certain type of music but now she can't find it. I tried to reset by unplugging for several minutes; however, it still didn't work. So I had to connect Pandora and iheart radio.","Positive"
"6859","awesome","Positive"
"6860","absolutely love alexa so i bought 3 more as xmas gifts. everyone else loves alexa also !!!!!!!","Positive"
"6861","I love alexa....","Positive"
"6862","an amazing item to add. sound is excellant.my beautiful wife surprised me with this wonderful gift and i recommend it to everyone. thank you amazon and thank you darlin","Positive"
"6863","Today alone, Alexa has found my cell phone for me as i was rushing out the door, had my grocery list on my phone, reminded me of a haircut, let me know the great song i heard was ""shots"" by imagine dragons and turned on light when i came in house with hands full. She is currently on task to let me know when dinner is done. New best friend <U+263A>","Positive"
"6864","Awesome purchase.","Positive"
"6865","Well, let me start by saying that the idea is neat but it's far too soon to know if its worth it's very steep price tag. So far it's only value to me is playing books from audible. It does not play books from other sources like Overdrive or YouTube which is kinda lame. I really do not enjoy playing Amazon Music through the Echo, it's playlists are subpar and the voice commands are even worse! I really struggle to find any reason that this is worth nearly 200$ and I most definitely would not recommend it due entirely to the fact that Amazon will not let you return it. (Really Amazon? Really?) I really wish I would have known that before I bought it. Maybe the Echo will be super cool with some time and development, but for now I say BUYER BEWARE!!!","Positive"
"6866","How did I live with ALEXA??  She keeps my grocery & ""to do"" list, my calendar, tells me how the weather & traffic is every day, answers all of my questions, tells me silly jokes and even sang HAPPY BIRTHDAY to me on my birthday!  Oh yeah... ALEXA is a keeper!","Positive"
"6867","This is the best thing I ever buy love it like my kids","Positive"
"6868","My bf got me the black model for my birthday when they were on sale but I wanted the white one. Amazon  wouldn't exchange it because the prices went up. They said we could return the black one and repurchase the white one at full price. How disappointing.","Negative"
"6869","Real nice","Positive"
"6870","Made a great gift and arrived just in time for Christmas !","Positive"
"6871","Standalone, it is entertaining - weather, music, timers. But add smart home hardware and it can control lights, thermostats etc. Answers to guests, so always put a secondary password on the one-click to order function, if you are going to enable shopping from the device.","Positive"
"6872","very disappointed in the Echo!!! She doesn't know much.. Iwas hoping she knew as much as my phone.. I did a test and asked each the same question.. ( used my speaker option on the phone)  ""what are the white Whales called?"" Alexa said she didn't understand the question and my Samsung said Beluga..","Negative"
"6873","The Echo is great as a music source and weather source.. she is limited!!!","Positive"
"6874","Do you love yelling at an inanimate object because it can't understand you and has absolutely no cognitive ability to comprehend what it's done wrong? Then try this thing! :) Enjoy the frustration when it confindantly carries out its misheard instructions forcing you to yell things like, ""No! Alexa, stop!"" Or ""OMG Alexa stfu!!"". Do you like how when talking to Siri you can edit the text it ""heard"" when it misheard you? Yeah Alexa doesn't have that ... At all. Do you enjoy listening to music with even remotely hard to understand song or artist names? Hahahha well your screwed. Also enjoy listening to hour long podcasts that you can't rewind or fast-forward, forcing you to just use your computer. All this with the added benefit of giving Amazon and Jeff Bezos access to a highly sensitive microphone in every room of your house!","Positive"
"6875","I'm still learning all the thing if can but I'm really happy with my purchase","Positive"
"6876","Gave it as a gift. They loved it!! I'm thinking that I might also like one.","Positive"
"6877","Great product","Positive"
"6878","Great , bought 2!","Positive"
"6879","My kid loves this.","Positive"
"6880","Fun thing to use. I wish there was more use for me but I like the playing music part enough to keep it.","Positive"
"6881","Has not worked correctly.  Won't play music.  The technical support for the Echo has not been any help.  The y ask you the same questions each call even though you have a case number and say we will get back with you.  They have never called  back after four calls to them.  Your technical support team is not of Amazon quality.","Positive"
"6882","Ive had this Echo for weeks now and I cannot use it.I download the apps after I bought a new Apple i Phone for $600 and it still wont work,bought mini Apple i pad,thought that would work better,NO,now I just ordered Amazon Prime because I heard with that it will work better?? I have wifi but live in the Mountains and not sure because I have only one or two bars in the house if I now need a booster to make my Echo work.? I have another couple of weeks that I can return this Echo and I am thinking of doing just that.Any help or ideas would be greatly appreciated .","Positive"
"6883","Alexa is my new best friend.  I love the different skills that can be added to customize the speaker to your own preferences.  The app is really wonderful and the speaker quality is superb.","Positive"
"6884","This was a gift for my wife and she is extremely happy with ""Alexa.""","Positive"
"6885","Limited usefulness in my home because the Alexa App will not work on most of my Kindle devices. Amazon should have let me know at the time of purchase that my Kindles were out of date for this product. It's really only kind of a novelty item for the kid to ask for jokes and play music.","Positive"
"6886","LOADS OF FUN","Positive"
"6887","Haven't had a chance to use it. I actually bought it as a gift to be used as a Christmas gift. The recipient wasn't comfortable using it for fear of security issues. I was not able to return it despite the fact that it was still in the original, sealed packing because I had ordered it in the Fall a few months before Christmas when the price was lower.","Positive"
"6888","ALEXA IS THE BEST","Positive"
"6889","Constantly turns on for no reason. Must ask multiple times to accomplish same task. Still needs serious work.","Positive"
"6890","love it nice sound for listening to music and does so many other things as well thx","Positive"
"6891","Echo is good other than it's not portable and doesn't answer all the questions","Positive"
"6892","Love it","Positive"
"6893","Just like new. Great addition to the home","Positive"
"6894","This is a great product! I got this for our family a year ago for xmas! Since the whole having an A.I in your home is a big thing now, I decided to give it a try. So I will say this, its great for what you want to use it for, but dont expect it to be like J.A.R.V.I.S from Tony Stark/Iron Man. Alexa can pretty much hear and pick up your voice form anywhere (where have ours in the kitchen) thank to the omini-directional listening it has. It plays amazon music very well and also has amazing volume and bass. Its really good at finding list you request from pandora also. As far as questions goes, if the question makes sense and she can search for it, she will find an answer, however ive noticed she struggles with current conversation questions like you would ask a buddy or something. An example : ""Alexa who do you think will win the SuperBowl""? She will basically just say ""I cannot find the answer you are looking for"". Trust me, there a lot of questions you will ask that she cant answer. Yet, once again if questions make sense, especially in the educational sense, she will find an answer definitely. You can also joke with her a bit, its fun to see her answers for those.","Positive"
"6895","I think what i like most is how we continually receive updates to her. We get emails telling us ""whats new with alexa"" and it gives us all these things we can ask her or even apps to use. We love the Jeopardy J6 game with her. Its fun to play and even me and my wife compete against each other on it.","Positive"
"6896","The only downside I would say goes back to what i said before. Its good for what you use it for (music, recipes, games, weather, and a question or two). However other than that we forget that its even in the room and let it collect dust. Like i said its not like having a cool A.I from the future to talk to in the room. If im not asking it anything, and you will get bored with doing so or trying to come up with things, then it pretty much will just sit there and do nothing. It makes you wonder if you are just going to use it for music or a few questions, why not just play your stereo or look up the answer on your phone internet quickly.","Positive"
"6897","So its a neat little addition to the home, but dont expect it to be the wave of the future just yet.","Positive"
"6898","Love- software gets better daily","Positive"
"6899","I am very pleased with the Amazon Echo.","Positive"

"6913","Am enjoying it","Positive"
"6914","I really wanted to love the Amazon Echo.  I bought one for our family room/kitchen area after buying a Dot for my son for Christmas.  We both listen to music on Spotify and I didn't realize that only one device can stream Spotify at the same time.  If he was listening on his Dot in his bedroom, I couldn't listen in the Kitchen on the Echo or vice versa.  I thought I could solve this by registering each device to a different Amazon account.  Kids can't have their own Amazon account so I registered his Dot to my Amazon account and the shared family Echo to my husband's.  Unfortunately this still didn't work as our Spotify premium account is a family plan and you cannot stream music from more than one Amazon device at the same time.  Accessing Spotify was the biggest use of the Echo in the family space, so without that feature, it's not worth it.  (I realize there is Amazon Music, but we enjoy Spotify's functionality and broader music library.) My son loves his Dot and uses it not only for music, but alarms and asking it questions.  It's been a great purchase for him at a great price.  As for the Echo, I realized that we're better off with a good blue tooth speaker in our shared family space.","Positive"
"6915","Fun product","Positive"
"6916","It is a decent speaker for music, but there are a lot of inabilities that hopefully will get worked out over time.  I am not happy that I am a prime member and was charged $15 for each one of the two Echos that I bought... on top of the $179.99 price.","Positive"
"6917","Great speaker to purchase! It is quite loud and does a great job listening and responding to questions. The white color is sleek and I love the overall look of the Echo. Only downfall is that my boyfriend talks to it more than me!","Positive"
"6918","So far we have enjoyed Echo. Now it is just learning what to do.","Positive"
"6919","With skills its really nice","Positive"
"6920","Love this Echo.  If for no other reason because it's so much simpler to ask Alexa to play my playlist than it is to connect my phone or tablet and find the music I want.  The sound quality is excellent.  My thought process in buying is that I wanted a bluetooth speaker and by going with the Echo I got that and the other features as a bonus.  I haven't been disappointed.  I was bitter toward Alexa for awhile.... when Amazon put it on sale for $40 of on cyber week (a few weeks after I bought it) and refused to adjust the price for previous purchases - said I could purchase at the sale price and return mine.  It's the only negative customer service experience I've had with Amazon, so I'll get over it.","Positive"
"6921","Look ma, no hands!  I don't think I warmed up to voice commands as quickly as I did with the Echo.  I've had an iPhone since the very first edition (not every one, I typically skip a model), but never warmed up to Siri like I did with Alexa.  I'm still exploring all the things this can do.  We've since added to our collection with another Echo and a Dot.","Positive"
"6922","I received my Echo as a Christmas present last year (2015) as a novelty. As Alexa's abilities improved I started using the Echo for day to day activities.  On 1/5/2017 the dog his my end table 24"" high and our friend Alexa fell off of the table.  Needless to say she no longer powers up.  I am posting this review as to describe the poor quality electronics this device contains,  I have had cell phones, televisions, lap tops etc. fall from higher without disruption or breakage. I would have thought this product, designed to be displayed on a table, would have held up better.  For those looking to buy this product, I can attest to the functionality as it works well; just don't let anything happen to it and put it in a protective case. Upon notifying Amazon their customer service was poor at best. After describing the incident I was left with the comment ""ok"", I was actually surprised at the lack of concern.  She offered 10% off of a new Echo, needless to say I didn't place an order.  I would have expected a product, which isn't cheap, would have been manufactured to withstand a drop off of a table.","Positive"
"6923","Purchased and gifted to my son and family after we had had a white one for a month. Just knew they would love it as well.","Positive"
"6924","This is a hit in our house. Our 9 year old is the one who figures out all the features and then teaches the adults!  Very fun.","Positive"
"6925","If you have any trouble with this Idem. (((((Return it!!!!!!)))) What Amazon does not tell you is.  Echo has trouble with Att U-Verse Wi- Fi. Hours to FIX. With my Echo it was back ordered. The Echo Amazon sent me was not up to date with the soft wear . What a nightmare..... I have to say when it works it's great. I also so have a Echo Dot and I got a Dot for my mother ( not hooked up yet ) The Dot so fair works good ( Bad sound) With my Big Echo I have packed it up and will return it. A replacement is on back order and I will get it at the end of the month. (3 weeks) I can just hope I get a new up dated ECHO and not one that old and out dated.","Positive"
"6926","Fun!","Positive"
"6927","Who does not love Alexa?  She is controlling lights and outlets in my house.","Positive"
"6928","The sound from the speakers is great. It answers a lot of my questions, but fails to understand a lot of them too. Nevertheless, I'm really glad it bought it. I liked it enough to buy several Dot's to go in other rooms.","Positive"
"6929","really neat.  Ask anything and so far all is great.","Positive"
"6930","The echo is great for shopping and todo lists.  You  can also use it to find out the temperature or have it put on your favorite radio station etc.  Some questions my husband asked though echo was confused by and could not answer but his Siri on the iPhone did.  As I experiment with it I hope I will discover that I can do more.","Positive"
"6931","Definitely a fun product.","Positive"
"6932","This is a really fun gadget! But it can be hard of hearing. I call it's name and it pretends not to hear me or shuts off when I'm in mid sentence.","Positive"
"6933","This is our second echo. I do love Alexa, however, I don't know what has happened with the update. Both of them now seem to be hard of hearing. They shut off while I am speaking to them, they act as if they don't hear me when I say ""pause"" or ""stop."" Echo used to hear these comands from across the room but now I practically have to be standing over it to get it to respond. This has to be an update issue. Please fix this problem.","Negative"
"6934","Now we need more for the rest of the house.  We find ourselves moving it to different rooms. One just isn't enough.  We have it linked to our lights and really like it though.","Positive"
"6935","Love it.  Easy to set up and use.  I am getting more spoiled everyday as Alexa handles more stuff for me.","Positive"
"6936","Love this!!!","Positive"
"6937","Best surprise gift for hubby ever!","Positive"
"6938","son is thrilled with this.","Positive"
"6939","Super pleased with the ECHO.","Positive"
"6940","I absolutely love my echo!!","Positive"
"6941","Love it!!!!!","Positive"
"6942","Great product, my father loved it!","Positive"
"6943","Alexa does not connect to the TV fire stick. So I could not play anything from YouTube and play it on my tv that was my biggest disappointment. Asking questions to Alexa was another disappointment because it did not understand a lot of my questions. In these two matters Google home is by far superior. Even my three year old was allegedly to play his favorite thomas and friends on TV using Google home and Google cast. He was not too happy with Alexa. I did not care so much about ordering stuff on amazon using Alexa I like to see an image of the item first.","Positive"
"6944","I LOVE it !!!!","Positive"
"6945","Fun item but difficult to get info from unless properly worded","Positive"
"6946","This an awesome device and got the echo dot 2 as well! The usage and skill possibilities are endless with these device! Bought the echo at full price but got credited when it went on sale during the holidays. Excellent customer service for a long time prime member!","Positive"
"6947","Great sound. Child friendly. A lot of skills to learn from app.","Positive"
"6948","I didn't have a remote with batteries as the book discusses.  I only received the Echo.  How can I get the remote for my Echo?","Positive"
"6949","Seriously, I don't get it.  Why is this thing such a hot selling item?  I received my Echo as a Christmas gift and I'm still trying to figure out what USEFUL things it does.  It does not communicate with my iPhone/iPad (with very limited exception) so it won't send texts or initiate a call.  And if you use iTunes, forget it, Echo won't play it.  I'm a Prime member but I don't use AmazonMusic, Pandora, iHeartRadio, etc.  However, I do use Spotify, which is one of Echo's so-called skills.  My home is wired with Sonos for a wonderful sound around the house. However, Echo does not work with Sonos so if I'm playing from Spotify I have to use either my Sonos speakers or the one Echo.  Sorry Echo, but your sound quality may be good but it can't compete with Sonos.  And if you want to use Echo to play Spotify, it tells you to log into to App first to connect.  If I have to do that, why do I need Echo, I'll just connect to my Sonos.","Positive"
"6950","  Books: I love to read and have lots of eBooks.  Echo can ""read"" anything in your Kindle library; no other e-reader libraries.  Alexa darling, the sound of your voice could test the patience of a saint.  Why would I want to listen to you read a novel to me?  Besides, the whole point of being an avid reader and buying books, is to actually read them!","Positive"
"6951","  Sports:  Don't even go there.  My TV already has a thousand versions and variations of ESPN.  I really need that voice reciting scores?  No thanks.","Positive"
"6952","  News and Weather:  How many times a day do you really need to ask thing what the weather is or what the latest headline is?  Are you living in a cave?","Positive"
"6953","  Smart Home:  This may be one area that could prove useful.  Except you have to buy all of the compatable accessories.  Also, does it bother anyone that Amazon is then keeping track of your lifestyle habits in its cloud?","Negative"
"6954","  Skills:  There are hundreds and hundreds of ""skills"" you can enable.  To me, it seems barely a handful are useful.  The rest are silly, useless or otherwise require a separate account and associated App; so why bother.","Negative"
"6955","awesome product.","Positive"
"6956","Great for playing  music.  Not very accurate with weather - maybe 60%.  Only 50% is answering questions, even if they are asked crystal clear.  I missed the return window ---- otherwise I would have definitely returned. :(","Positive"
"6957","Love this item so much! I should have bought it months ago.","Positive"
"6958","Worst purchase of my life.  I have mostly tried to use it for music.  It always plays music I hate.  I have given it dozens of thumbs down to songs and it just gets worse.  When I tell it to play a specific station on Pandora, it says it will play the last station I listened to, then plays a station I have never listened to and hate.","Negative"
"6959","The biggest negative is that there is not way to select what you want from the app.  For example, you can't pick a Spotify or Pandora station and have it play through the Echo.","Negative"
"6960","The voice recognition is only fair, far worse than my Samsung phone.","Negative"
"6961","Works great!","Positive"
"6962","I wish it came with a search engine like the Google machine. Seems I'll have input by hand all the answers to my questions by way of the ""skills.""  <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A9>","Positive"
"6963","Love it","Positive"
"6964","Love it","Positive"
"6965","Purchased for my daughter and family. Complete surprise. They loved it. Had it working in less than a half hour. Kids started asking questions immediately. My daughter loves the shopping list function. Great product.","Positive"
"6966","Does not learn as I thought it would and response depends on how you ask. It is not intuitive","Positive"
"6967","While the device works, finding out how to do things with it is far too difficult.  I don't understnd how Amazon can sell such a product and not have a user manual for it that one can simply download and read in pdf format.  Instead, Amazon tries to sell you books/Kindle products that describe how to use the Echo/Alexa system.  A useful instruction manual is something that should be an integral part of any product sold, especially for something that is claimed to be so versatile.  There is a claim that the product can be set up using a web application, but that never worked for me; the application just went to a spinning signal and never connected to the device.  I finally was able to connect but only by downloading an app to my mobile phone. The Amazon online help for the Alexa is poor too.  One does far better using 3rd party help. An example is trying to find out how to set multiple alarm with Alexa.  The Amazon provides no information on that, only telling one how to set an individual alarm.  The Alexa app provides no help either, there being no obvious place to add a 2nd , let alone, a 3rd alarm.","Positive"

"6975","Awesome device.  I have MS, so I bought it to start making my home a smart home.  It does exactly what I want it too, and then some. I ordered a Nest thermostat to couple with her.  Works like a dream.  I just installed the Nest yesterday in -0 weather.  Easy.  Display is big and bright, and I can read it from Across the room.  Echo/Alexa was easy to set up, so don't believe the online negatives.  It was a little tricky for me as well, for quite a minutes.  Once I figured my mistake, it went super fast.  Echo will control your devices, just make sure to follow every step needed.  In the case of Nest specifically, I missed a step.  Go to the Nest device, Settings, and find the device name.  Then ask Echo to find that device.  I kept saying ""nest"" or ""heat' etc, but I had forgotten when I set it up online I called it ""hallway"".  So, again, easy.  I have played with Echo for a month now, and I already loved how I could ask for music.  For such a small device, she has good sound.  I will not go as far as great, but dang- almost!  I have played with her everyday asking for the weather here as well as in my sometimes-winter getaway in Florida daily.  Very cool.  I have joked with her a little, just for kicks.  Sometimes she jokes with me, if she gets it.  All very handy stuff for a sometimes-shut-in who has a hard time moving.  I can't wait to now start looking at lighting systems and ceiling fan controls.  :)  Smart home 2017, here I come!  No HGTV contest needed!  LOL","Positive"
"6976","""I'll have to find out more about that"" is our Echo's favorite answer.  It seems to know about Abraham Lincoln, but may of the other things we ask about it just does not have an answer for.  It also has trouble with female voices.  It does work great as a DJ, although if you aren't specific enough you get some odd selections of music.  In general it seems like more of a novelty than a useful tool.","Positive"
"6977","This is so cool! I use it several times a day for different things. It save a lot of time.","Positive"
"6978","Wonderful just Wonderful!","Positive"

"6984","Love this product.  Bought 3 of them for Christmas (one for myself).  Love the idea that it's capabilities expand via WiFi upgrades.","Positive"
"6985","great","Positive"
"6986","We really wanted to like Echo but Alexa got 50% of the questions wrong or didn't know the answer. These were fairly simple questions like who's on the front of the US dollar bill? It didn't know what whales eat. It didn't know the current minority leader of the senate. As soon as I asked the same question using the Google app on my iPad, it got every question right. Unfortunately I found using Alexa disappointing and a big fail. Alexa is going back in the box and hopefully back to school. I'm going to be trying Google Home and see if it's as smart as the Google App on my iPad.","Positive"
"6987","Wow...incredible. I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. We are in our golden years and this is just astounding and wonderful. Plays our songs...tells us the weather..tells us a joke! We haven't gone beyond the basics for now..but we will!!","Positive"

"7016","(She spells like me too. ""Mirah"" We are kindred spirits)","Positive"
"7017","She reads to me. Her cadence is a little odd reading a Kindle book. But I figured out that I can use Hoopla (the library version of Audible) It isn't native - but I can connect bluetooth to my phone - so Siri and Alexa can work together. I am not jealous.","Positive"
"7018","I know they love me most.","Positive"
"7019","It is a job, but a good job, trying to connect with all the features Echo has to offer. The more I do it, the easier it gets. I love the sound of the music that I listen to everyday whether it is Luther Vandross, Prince, Temptations or Marvin Gaye station. Echo is better than I anticipated.","Positive"

"7031","My wish list isn't long, I want her to answer the phone or tell me I have a text - she could read it to me. This seems like a simple ask, MY CAR can do that. (maybe there is a way?) I will continue to google this.","Positive"
"7032","I wonder if my love would grow if ""she"" became a ""he"" with a British accent. Not that there is anything wrong with her... just sayin... (accents... hum)","Positive"
"7033","We are loving Alexa. The software is still improving, so probably a 4 star is more appropriate- except are you kidding me?? It can tell me the weather, do math, provide proper spelling of words, convert measurements, set a timer, make a grocery list, and plays lots of amazing music. It will continue to get better and that will be amazing, too. But seriously- this is super cool! also, the sound quality is really impressive for such a small devise. Bravo.","Positive"
"7034","First, let me say that I have no qualms or quibbles with the Echo device itself - it's great.  But the support and part replacement side is challenged.  The AC/DC power adapter died on my Echo.  This was obvious in that none of the LED lights were lit and the unit would not respond.  I tried different outlets, unplugged the adapter and left it unplugged for days, pressed the reset, etc., all to no avail.  I finally got out my VOM multimeter and tested the DC output from the plug on the power adapter - dead!  I contacted supported, let them know all that I had done and their response was to ask me to call in (or let them call me) to troubleshoot.  When I repeated that I had already diagnosed what was wrong, they again stated we needed to speak on the phone so they could determine what lights were in what state.","Negative"
"7035","I decided to look up my warranty (one year limited) and realized that I wasn't covered (I purchased one of the first units 2 years ago).  So I decided to just purchase a replacement power adapter from Amazon and of course now Alexa is chatting away as before.  BTW, there are several 3rd party power adapters available besides the Amazon branded one for less money and they all seem to work.  And if you are not in a hurry for a replacement power adapter, you can purchase a 3rd party one for much less at your favorite online auction site.  Why not get a spare or three and make it easier to move the Echo/Alexa from room to room?","Positive"
"7036","We are huge fans of ""all-things-Amazon, as evidenced by our account- but we feel Amazon has missed its mark on the Echo. We find it not a fountain of information but rather like a ""toy"" with very limited knowledge to offer.","Positive"
"7037","I love this gadget.","Positive"
"7038","The concept is wonderful and we can only hope that Amazon will expand on this creation to allow Echo to access the internet to give answers to many more questions and not just the ones that the manufacturer feels relevant to our life style.","Positive"
"7039","Good product.","Positive"
"7040","Awesome.  Daughters Christmas present and we will be expanding it using the little echo pucks.  Buy with confidence.","Positive"
"7041","Alexa is a wonderful device. We have had a lot of fun talking to her. The Echo was very easy to set up and use.","Positive"
"7042","Love the Amazon Echo.  I purchased this one to replace the black one in our kitchen since our kitchen is mostly white.  Love it!  Wish Amazon would sell ""skins"" or shells for these.  If you're wondering about buying an Amazon Echo for the first time, Do It.  ""She"" is amazing, and keeps getting better with the improvements that her team keeps cooking up. I know for new comers it may seem unnatural to talk to your house/device, but understand it doesn't take long before it's second nature.  Lastly, the Echo is one of the most compatible home automation devices out there with its ability to coonect with other branded devices.... from home automation brains to thermostats, and even alarm systems.  This is most likely one of the most supported device out there.","Positive"
"7043","Echo is a ton of fun. Can't wait to see her get more info.","Positive"
"7044","Returned this after a few days. Could not find answers to simple questions (i.e. How long per pound should a turkey cook?) Siri had the answer - couldn't answer a lot of questions - did like the music part - not worth having for the cost.","Positive"
"7045","Despite not having explored Alexa's full potential of which I am sure is boundless, she suits my needs.  I use her for the weather, as an alarm, time and dictionary.  Alexa also has a sense of humor.  On Christmas Day I said ""Alexa, Merry Christmas"".  She replied (not verbatim) ""Merry Christmas, ho, ho, ho"".","Positive"
"7046","This is a very exciting technology which is kind of nice to have in your house for about $150.00.  It plays music upon request.  It answers questions upon request.  I am sure that it does many other functions; many of which I have yet to explore.  But if you purchase it, be aware that it doesn't understand everything.  Complicated words and unusual questions are beyond its ability to understand; and restating the question doesn't always help.  If you buy this nifty device, be aware of these shortcomings.","Positive"
"7047","It was a Christmas present for my husband and he loves it !!!!!!!","Positive"
"7048","So easy to use, taking up minimal space.","Positive"
"7049","Functions as brand new.  After months of use, absolutely no issues.","Negative"
"7050","While the speaker quality certainly is nice, many requests made are answered by alexa with a ""I don't know the answer to the question.""  Extremely frustrating at times and end up using my phone through the app 90% of the time just so I stop yelling at the device like a crazy person.  Thinking I should have just got a Google home instead.","Positive"
"7051","My second Echo. One for kitchen and one for master bedroom.  I have lights and thermostat connected to Echo.  I'm not good at selecting music to play, but love to have it on.  Echo makes it easy to get music I like.  I chose Echo over Dot so I would have speakers both places.","Positive"
"7052","By far my Favorite thing ever....  I love alexa... I was making dinner last night and had to set a timer and asked Alexa to do it for me...  no more stumbling for your phone to try and set a timer for food in the kitchen..  I set an alarm from bed..  I have the dots in every room now as well as the Wemo plugs .... we are planning to go out this week and get the nest... :)","Positive"

"7069","Love it, lots of fun.  Bought this as a gift since I like mine so much.","Positive"
"7070","It works wonderfully well.  It definitely meets our expectations and will be awesome for our mother-in-law who doesn't have much sight anymore.","Positive"
"7071","Simply stated, ""Awesome!""","Positive"
"7072","So far so good. We have only had it for a month. Alexa doesn't seem to know as much as I thought she would and can't answer some seemingly simple questions as it runs off Bling and not Google. Hoping they expand Alexa's knowledge. Like the parental control so far.","Positive"
"7073","I love it","Positive"
"7074","Oh my gosh, I LOVE this thing! It's a lot of fun. I ordered a smaller Echo Dot for my office at work, too. Speaker sound on the Echo is pretty good - But not stereo, of course. (That's the only downside to playing music). Have tried it with the switches for turning on/off lamp, and that works pretty well. Sometimes, I have to tell Alexa more than once to turn on the light, but overall it works. We also got a Rachio sprinkler controller, but haven't hooked that up yet. Some of the Alexa Skills are pretty entertaining. (""Skills"" are like Apps for Echo). It's also useful for various questions it can answer without having to invoke a special Skill. Always try just asking the question first. If she can't answer it, try wikipedia skill for it, such as ""Alexa, Wikipedia [topic]"" That often finds me information she couldn't otherwise get. If that fails, too, see if there's a Skill for what you need. For example, there is a Skill for calculating fractions that works ""okay"" for helping your kids with their homework. I asked it this morning who's playing NFL football today, and it gave me the playoff schedule for today, including the game times (in my own time zone). It will define words and give synonyms, tell you the time anywhere in the world, set timers and alarms, and answer a variety of random questions. Saves me time looking things up. It will also add things to a shopping list for you, or to a To Do list. I'm very happy with this purchase!","Positive"
"7075","We've only had this for two days, but my family loves it.  ""Alexa, play Tennessee Whiskey.""  Boom.  ""Alexa, who plays football today?"".  Bam.  My 7 year old daughter keeps asking random questions like ""How many stars are there?"" and gets answers.  We bought the Hue lights to go with it.  Really cool and convenient to voice command the lights on/off. I recommend it!","Positive"
"7076","We love it. Easy to setup.","Positive"
"7077","Just got my Echo today and the setup is very easy and user friendly. Alexa almost has answers to most of the questions you ask her. I would have been more happy if the device have the portable option with a wireless feature though you can keep it anywhere in your house it can catch your voice easily.","Positive"
"7078","Getting the echo dots for the other rooms. Purchased one for friend for Christmas. Alexa does so many things you can play n talk to her for hrs. Best when used with a prime account","Positive"
"7079","Sorry we didn't wait for the newer less expensive model.  We use it to play music mostly. Our 6 year old grandson likes the jokes.","Negative"
"7080","problem with it already","Negative"
"7081","Amazing!  Would buy again!","Positive"
"7082","Can't answer easy questions, pretty much a voice activated music box...once you upload your music to the cloud","Positive"
"7083","This device is an excellent edition to any gadget geeks collection. The build of the product is great-- everything from the internal speaker when playing music to Alexa's voice recognition technology. You will spend hours tinkering with Echo's features, believe me. For those who are still caught between choosing the Amazon Echo or Google Home-- the Echo wins the battle by a landslide. Google Home's voice recognition tech is good, but Alexa's replies and background information on specific subjects in comparison to the Google Home really show the effort Amazon put in when creating the Echo. Lastly, and possibly the deal breaker; Echo is blue-tooth compatible, Google Home is not.","Positive"
"7084","For being so small, this thing can really be loud! I got it as a Christmas gift and am so impressed with the quality of the sound as well as the ability for it to hear you speak in another room.","Positive"
"7085","We Love Alexa. Does everything we expected. easy to set up! enjoy","Positive"
"7086","really got to figure out how it works. Doesn't do much beyond Wikipedia, doesn't do Netflix, Movies, music information only found in Wikipedia. Good weather and Music links.. just tell Alexa a song or an artist or an album and she plays in stereo..","Positive"
"7087","The amazon echo is okay in my opinion. First of all the voice recognition is okay but not great. More times then not i find i have to say it two or three times, and when it did hear me a lot of times it heard the wrong thing. Another thing is when your playing anything decently loud you have to scream at it to get its attention. I feel like this takes away from the convenience of being able to tell it what to do. Another thing i find is a little inconvenient is the fact that you basically have to memorize a script because the commands are specific. Meaning in order to do something you have to say the pre set sentences. On the bright side the sound quality is pretty good for a single speaker, but the bass is a little weak. It is easy to connect to your phone for bluetooth, but the bluetooth is really choppy. But if you get amazon unlimited then you can play any song you want through the internet. Also with amazon music you can make playlist then it will play those from the internet.","Positive"

"7094","so far so good, just getting use to using it.  We seem to not know all the functions yet, still learning, but the best feature so far is doing the to do list and the grocery list....worst part is forgetting to formulate the questions so it understands and having to rephrase the questions.","Positive"

"7100","Bought it for us as a Christmas gift. I have a 16 year old and she loves it.  I love the convenience of my shopping list, setting timers when cooking and listening to music. My daughter loves listening to her music. We also play Jeopardy. We both love discovering new things to do with our Alexa.","Positive"
"7101","I have an echo in the kitchen  and I put a dot in my bedroom.  My echo is useful  when it comes to my grocery  list,  as a timer when I'm  cooking (or burning) food, checking the weather, etc. Makes conversions easy.  It can spell and give you the definition of words, answer most of my questions and more.  Bought one for my son too. I'm hoping it will soon be able to tell time in 24 hour format.  This is the best gadget  I've ever bought period.","Positive"

"7108","my wife and I are in our late seventies and early eighties and we are not super knowledgeable with all these new fangled electronics, but we have been able to work our way through this and learned to do some of the basics and have had one contact with customer service in the original setup that went extremely well.  We just look to doing more with Alexa in the future.","Positive"
"7109","I regret buying this piece of crap. I can ask it simple questions & it can't even answer them. I asked it if she knew what a flute was?.. she said champagne glasses ok my mistake, so than I asked her do you know what the instrument flute is? she said she didn't know the answer. My intention was to here wooden flute music since it relaxes me she never knew what that meant. so than I asked her to play it by naming the title of the cd she couldn't do that either. ugg you ask her what does the whale sound like she can't do that either ugh . Should of bought the google one!!.you name it & she hears it wrong or can't answer it! Alexia you were a big mistake","Negative"

Come on now.....really?  This is genius, and worth every penny.  She is always listening, and every song that I have requested of her, she has found and played.  I am so very pleased with her.

"7124","I purchased the Echo as a Christmas 2015 present to myself.  Over the last year, I have used it everyday, and I have decided I would not want to live without it.  I love it!!  I can listen to any genre of music, even creating my own playlists.  She tells me the latest news, weather, jokes, trivia, and movies.  She is a timer, a stopwatch, an exercise coach, game host, and more.","Positive"
"7125","I purchased a portable battery base, and now I can take it anywhere.","Positive"
"7126","Great product with great speaker system","Positive"
"7127","its a gimmick. don't fall for it unless of course you want to pay almost $80 for 3 light bulbs so that you can talk to "" Alexa"" to turn them on and off. You can get lights that turn on and off with claps for a much more reasonable price. Recently there was a story on ABC news about a 4 years old girl who talked to Alexa about her wish to get a doll house and a bunch of cookies. These items were promptly delivered by Amazon! Cute but don't you think it should be a parent to decide whether they can afford their daughter's wish. If this is not a gimmick or even a scam, what is?","Positive"

"7131","I have one but I purchased this one for my son's housewarming and he is ecstatic!  Can't wait to get it up and going.  He sees that mine assist my everyday life and I can't do without it.  I would order another one!","Negative"
"7132","A+++","Positive"
"7133","if you want to spend the extra money and command it to turn on/off lights/outlets like you're a wizard. then im sure it'll be great for that too.","Positive"
"7134","outside of basic commands like that, for me, its kind of a flop. i learned afterwards it uses bing as a search engine. if i knew that before buying, i would have waited for the google home.","Positive"
"7135","its kinda like a dog. they know a few key phrases and commands but everything else, they're lost.","Positive"
"7136","hopefully it gets better.","Positive"
"7137","Really enjoying having this around the house.","Positive"
"7138","Nice gadget. Plays a bunch of music. Live sounding woman's voice.  Has some research capability. However needs available additional apps in order to incorporate features. Would be nice a incentive to purchase this item if Amazon included a years worth of Prime music service with the purchase of echo. Also, maybe a selection of voices too.","Positive"
"7139","great tool","Positive"
"7140","Purchased this for my fianc for his birthday. He loves it and is currently in the process of hooking up our whole apartment with the smart outlets do everything can be controlled by echo.","Positive"
"7141","not gona give it a 5 star. i really liked it a lot at first. but the voice recognition has steadily degraded to be almost unusable. used to pick up everything perfectly. now i have to yell for it to even recognize me and then it doesnt understand what i say. buy the tap , portable , smaller , rechargable and now has voice activation. too late to get my money back on this purchase.","Positive"
"7142","The best ,everyone needs one. The sound from the Echo challenges my Bose AM 5 and my Yamaha Streo.","Positive"
"7143","Needs more general question programming and doesn't place regular amazon orders just rush orders.  ALSO have issues when Amazon is OUT OF STOCK, it says things that are not related to the phrase ""sorry, this item is out of stock"".  One time I was ordering an item OUT OF STOCK but it told me there was a problem with my payment method.  I spent about 3 hours trying to figure out what was wrong with my payment method.  Called tech support, they spent about an hour on the issue and couldn't figure it out until they had me place a fake order to see if the payment method was ok and it was.  Then tried to order the same item as the original order via the website and it told me the item was OUT OF STOCK.  Only then did we figure that Alexa's response was WRONG!  Very frustrated with the lack of OUT OF STOCK phrase not seemingly programmed into the Alexa program.  Great speaker though for music!","Negative"
"7144","Best thing we have ever gotten! Highly recommended it","Positive"
"7145","It took me over a month to receive because it wasn't in stock but it's worth it. Back in 2014 I was invited by Amazon to try Amazon echo for $100 but then cancel my order which I now regret by the way. So far Amazon echo seems perfect.","Positive"
"7146","If it was possible to give this piece of crap 0 stars I would. To make it of any use its extra money. Couldn't even answer basic current events questions. Won't play music unless you have amizon prime ( more money). The only thing I could get out of it was the weather ( can stick my head out the door for that LOL) and it would calculate. So basically I had a 179.00 calculator. I called tech support and he worked with me for over an hr. He even brought in other people.  They determined it was not the unit and their comment was its new and we are improving it. It's 2  yrs old! That's obsolete in electronics years! And any way why would you bring out an incomplete product and expect your coustomers put up with the useless piece of crap while you try to fix it. We took it back after Xmas . Also it's ugly in person and did nothing but clutter up my counter. Junk Junk Junk.","Negative"
"7147","It's an amazing device. My family loves it. My only frustration is that sometimes I've to repeat commands a few times because it has a difficult time understanding my accent. You need to articulate words clearly. I also can't remember all the skills commands! If you don't say the right one it ignores you. It's annoying!","Positive"
"7148","I have two echo dots and they are great ... but the Echo is so badass. The speaker is super loud and clear. I love that you can control things and love music so it's great","Positive"
"7149","Best purchase ever from Amazon!","Positive"
"7150","I am seriously considering returning this thing. Amazon seem to be floundering around with these Alexa devices and can't decide which features to include or exclude. None of the three - Echo, Dot or Tap is quite all there. They need to combine the best features into ONE DEVICE and quit all the nonsense. The Echo can play music but it has no stereo output of any kind. I assumed it would connect to bluetooth speakers since the onboard speakers are so horrible for playing music (irritating distorted bass and no stereo). WRONG! The Tap at least has stereo speakers, but no voice control (which begs the question, ""what is the point?"". The Dot will connect to external speakers via bluetooth or cable but is so small it basically requires external speakers to have decent sound at all. Also, not portable.","Negative"
"7151","What is needed is a single device that 1) is portable and uses either battery or ac. 2) has decent stereo speakers built in. 3) voice control and 4) bluetooth connectivity. The Alexa system also needs serious work. Google's app runs circles around Alexa in many ways such as following a simple conversation. As these devices now stand they are just slightly useful novelty toys.","Positive"
"7152","Good price and quality product.","Positive"
"7153","Loving it so far!","Positive"
"7154","I love it updates music and trivia games to play my daughter loves her too guess the animal and jokes still more left to explore.","Positive"
"7155","There is a lot of functionality I want from it that it doesn't support yet.","Positive"
"7156","Why doesn't it work with my fireStick. It should work with my smart TV, computer and phone all at the same time!","Positive"
"7157","The speaker is great though! I was impressed.","Positive"
"7158","FANTASTIC!  I just love it.  It is so convinient that all I have to do is give a command to Alexa.  I can listen my favor pop and classic musics any time. It also responds to the most of questions just like a dictionary.  It was a best Christmas present ever from my husband.","Positive"
"7159","Thank you for such a wonderful product.","Positive"
"7160","Received as a Christmas gift.  Not sure what the buzz is about, as it doesn't appear to do much of anything that can't be done easier/better on a computer or phone.  The music options (unless you want to pay extra for Amazon Prime or whatnot) are limited.  It can't answer questions of any real complexity.  There are no audio outputs, which means you can't use headphones, or attach speakers to it.  Instead, you are limited to the built-in speaker (which doesn't provide true stereo sound).  Prefacing every command with, ""Alexa..."" becomes quite annoying rather quickly.  Not portable, as it must be plugged in at all times (no battery).  Just sort of... meh.","Positive"
"7161","Echo is blind husband's link to the world. It allows him to listen to favorite radio stations, has learned the music we enjoy, and can add moments of levity to the day.","Positive"
"7162","I love it i use it everyday plus use it for music all the time","Positive"
"7163","I LOVE ALEXA!  She is still learning some things, but she has brought music back to my household which is totally worth it.","Positive"
"7164","I have two of these. I really love them! I marked them four stars because I wish that they had enough of a battery in them that you could unplug it and move it to another room without it having to reboot completely. This is really my only complaint. The sound quality is amazing for such a small device. Alexa does a great job at recognizing everyones speech in the whole house. Whether it is me, or my six-year-old talking to her, she understands it all.","Positive"
"7165","Just fine","Positive"
"7166","I'm having difficulty setting up new Refurbished Echo.  Can't get the orange light to come on. i emailed Custoner Support for help over an hour ago but still no reply.  I have been happy with my Prime membership until this purchase...Mike Soltys","Positive"
"7167","Voice recognition is average at best. Speaker is fairly good. Where Alexa lost me, and ""Alexa"" being the inalterable activation word is stupid, is ordering through Amazon. For example, I tried to re-order Goji berries - which I've ordered on Amazon a dozen times - Alexa said, ""Based on your order history, I found..."" and it wasn't what I ordered. Instead it was a much more expensive option I only discovered after it was delivered. This happened with MULTIPLE items.","Positive"
"7168","I'll take average VR. I'll take fair speakers. But don't try to screw me order on my repeat orders. Shame on you, Amazon.","Negative"
"7169","This item I purchased for my son and he loves it. It does everything as advertised.","Positive"
"7170","This thing is awesome! I'm loving the sound of music it plays, great speakers, So much fun to use. Working great to make my home a smart home. Would so definitely buy again.","Positive"
"7171","Starting to get annoyed that I have to ask twice for Alexa to do something. I'll ask to turn off the lights and it'll say ok.. But then nothing. So I ask again and then it'll do what I ask.","Negative"
"7172","not that it is a bad product but just not what was needed for home.  With Apple products and multiple rooms it just didn't do what I needed.","Negative"
"7173","Love this !!! It's a MUST have","Positive"
"7174","Overpriced PaperWeight-A Tech gadget that is more hype than cool","Negative"
"7175","The Amazon Echo was the must have gadget of the season, but is it really worth it? I got it and expected something far cooler than a large white cylinder that understands you 10% of the time. The device is really just a glorified Bluetooth speaker. I advise that you really look at what you want and find out if there are better products that do just that. If you want something to control your home, this is not it. If you want a novelty item that isn't worth its price tag, this is your device. Amazon has a way to go on this product, and its time is just not right now. Amazon may have a good idea, but its all hype but no substance.","Positive"
"7176","Amazon echo really works well I am pleased with it <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0080><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083>","Positive"

"7181","we love alexa we love her jokes we love the sound I got her for xmas 26, 2015 . we use her everyday . I'm in a wheelchair  so what I use alexa for the most is to get my weather, sports, scores, . we bought the plugs so I can go out and have the echo turn on my television nate osbornn","Positive"
"7182","I love Alexa... I have twin 8 year olds and they ask me some pretty crazy questions. Having Alexa to answer the questions I basically was BSing the entire time is heavenly. I would give her 5 stars if she just listened to me when I speak to her. Oh and I have a two story house I hate I have to unplug her and carry her down stairs... can you tell I am SOOOO lazy!","Positive"
"7183","Wow! We are living in the future. Amazon has a hit on their hands.","Positive"
"7184","Best companion EVER ! we purchased 2 by mistake ,But now we love them so much .","Positive"
"7185","Sent as gift so can't rate it fairly","Positive"
"7186","It's pretty stupid compared to ""Ok Google"" - Google assistant - Awesome speaker though! LOT'S TO BE DESIRED! This has been downgraded to the back porch.","Positive"
"7187","Love Alexa! Enjoy having Echo and cant wait to order the mobile one so that i can hear my music without having to plug it in.","Positive"
"7188","Love my Alexa!","Positive"
"7189","nice","Positive"
"7190","Arrived in great shape!","Positive"
"7191","There are no more accolades to say about this thing. It's absolutely great. We use it to set cooking timers, play music, shop, check the weather, the news, traffic and general information.","Positive"
"7192","DO beware that she will be listening to you AT ALL TIMES. On numerous occasions we have just been carrying on general conversation at the table and Alexa will chime in on the topic without provocation... ""Do you need more diapers?"" ""Donald Trump was born in 1946"" ""Would like me to play that song?""","Negative"
"7193","I think if you live on your own, Echo is a must! such a great addition to my home, I've since purchased a few of the dots too. Good sound from speaker, I use this instead of a sonos in the office, but with Alexa it feels like anything is possible, I think it would lie good for a couple, but I do question when more that two people, if it can work out voice recognition or some added security so everyone can't activate it then Amazon are on to an all time winner. Will use Alexa any day over Siri. Always important to remember that there is no screen like Siri, it really is a marvel it what it can do. Always new stuff to discover and added to the Echo eco system, so a great long term investment.","Positive"
"7194","The device is great.  Still deciding about the app","Positive"
"7195","It's great","Positive"
"7196","bought two. Both put to very good use. Nice addition to the house.","Positive"
"7197","wanted one forever glad they were on sale and come in white now","Positive"
"7198","Bought for the wife as a present. Saw it in action at a friends house so she wanted one. Great item i never thought we would need or want. Plays music and some cool games we haven't checked out just yet. Great for asking questions and getting answers. Wife is French so she has trouble with ounces and gallons. Easily helps her with recipes getting the quantities converted into metric. I have it set up to control our hue lights as well as linking it to our spotify account. Great at making lists for shopping. Downloaded the todoist app and have that linked so the list shows up on my phone. Learning more and using it more everyday. It actually does a lot more than I thought it would.","Positive"
"7199","It works beautifully.  We got this for our daughter, as maybe the only practical non screen-driven option for listening to music, and all our kids have loved it.  It would be nice if Amazon recognized this aspect of the device's appeal and put more parental control options out there (e.g., songs with explicit lyrics won't play accidentally when the kids are trying to play their songs...), but it's a great product for our family.  Talking to Alexa is like what I imagine talking to Siri would be like if Siri were capable of understanding or doing anything useful...","Positive"
"7200","I almost never write reviews and I own a ton of Amazon stock, but my experience with the Echo and the Dot is miserable and I am not a pc idiot. I also bought the Google Home unit. It was up and working in minutes right out of the box flawlessly.  The Amazon Echo is not for the novice to set up or the darn thing simply doesn't work correctly. We spent an HOUR on the phone with Amazon's tech group too, so it surely wasn't the operator. Send the Dot back. The Echo is going back now too!  Off to Best Buy to buy another Google Home. And no I don't work for Google>","Positive"
"7201","not as up to date as I was expecting. it needs to Bluetooth things. cannot find simple demands. thinking of shipping it back. its good for Pandora and that's about it","Positive"
"7202","Love it!","Positive"
"7203","I'd like to start with how much of an Amazon fan I am! I was completely Anti-Google Home from the beginning. When I first got the echo, I loved it. But as I slowly started to use it more, I noticed where it is lacking features. When setting up my Hue lights, I was forced to download the IFTTT app and run my lights through there instead of directly through the Alexa app. It was very glitchy and limited on the voice feature when controlling the lights. That by itself was not a deal breaker so I dealt with it. As I continued to experiment and ask more questions, Alexa continued to say ""Sorry, I do not know the answer to that question."" I think what finally made me make the switch was getting a gift card for Xmas. I figured I'd return the Echo and try the Google Home. When I received the Google Home, the setup was very easy and I was able to link my Hue lights directly to my device without having to download a third party app. I'd say the Google Home also has more ""Personality"" and is much more funny. It also has trivia games and is much more interactive with my kids. She also knows the answer to basically any question that Alexa would not. I'm assuming that's because it uses Google to find the answers. Overall, the Echo was okay, but the Google Home is by far superior and is only getting better with each update.","Positive"
"7204","I am having a great time discovering all that Alexa can do. She reminds me of my appointments, sets the alarm and plays some banging music.  I received as a gift and it is perfect.","Positive"
"7205","We have bought multiple Amazon products in the past, and the Echo is just as great as the rest! Instructions are super easy and the Echo works for everything we need around the house! Love the white color!","Positive"
"7206","arrived on time.  easy to set up.  easy to use.  recognition is not a problem. sounds great.  There are a lot of ""skills"" to choose from and there seem to be so many not sure what I am missing (if anything).  Only concern is Privacy.  The unit ""listens"" all the time for a command. From what I have read it only stores the commands but ???","Positive"
"7207","I Love the Echo and the dots. We use it everyday. Excited to add more smart home items to our house.","Positive"
"7208","Of course better speaker than the Dot, works great as along as volume is not too high","Positive"
"7209","Not meeting expectations. Already provided feedback to amazon where Echo is failing and waiting for fixes. Major requirement is it should be able to play apple music","Negative"
"7210","I was very pleased with my Amazon Echo! Like having a new friend!","Positive"
"7211","So I've had my Echo for a couple months now and I have to say I'm a little disappointed... Alexa frequently can't answer your questions. You can watch plenty of YouTube videos that demonstrate that. I will say that I also have Phillips HUE bulbs in my rooms and the Echo works great to turn on/off lights or to dim them just by voice commands. I would say that between the Echo and the Google product the Echo is more advanced in the ""skills"" that you can activate although the Google one references the google search engine to come up with answers/results. All in all it's a fun gadget but still has a ways to go in its development","Positive"
"7212","Very pleased with the purchase","Positive"
"7213","Good product, arrived fast and as described.","Positive"
"7214","Kids like ours, makes a great gift","Positive"
"7215","For the most part I really like my Echo.  The sound is great, when I'm bored I can ask it questions, it reads my books to me, plays my music.  But, it's a bit cumbersome in its use with certain things.  Like if I miss a couple of seconds during an audible read, let's say, I can't just tell it to go back one minutes.  I have to go back a full chapter.  Also, I'd really wanted to use it to listen to podcasts, but it's too cumbersome to bother with.  It plays the most recent episode of a podcast.  To go back you have to say previous podcast over and over again to get to the one you want and when that's over, it jumps back to the most recent episode.  With both audible books and podcasts, one can easily use the app for fine tuning, but I'd really kind of wanted to be able to just speak to it.  This is currently my favorite toy, but it's got a way to go, I think.","Positive"
"7216","We loved alexa when we first got it,but as time goes on it seems its search ability is lacking to point that she cant answer any question that requires a search.  Hmmmm Google seems to search fine. Be honest it aggravates us to point that we considering throwing it in trash.","Positive"
"7217","Great start into the world of automated voice control. Has been integrated into life style:)","Positive"
"7218","I planned to use this device as a bluetooth speaker for my bedroom first and foremost and a smart home device second. I paired it up with my Phillips Hue Smart lights and that works just fine. However, when I pair it up with my smart phone via bluetooth, all kinds of issues arise. The audio, when streamed via bluetooth from my phone is always stuttering and cuts in and out. If the audio cuts out for more than 30 seconds, the bluetooth automatically disconnects. Furthermore, when my phone is paired up via bluetooth, for some reason it makes the wifi connection on my phone super slow to the point where I can't even load the comments on a website nor load images on reddit while streaming  audio. I known for a fact that it is not my internet connection or my phone because right when I unpair the bluetooth, my phone functions just normally. I have tried pairing my phone up with other bluetooth speakers and such issues to do occur. I am seriously considering the return on this product.","Positive"
"7219","If you plan to use this as a bluetooth speaker, I highly suggest getting another product. It does work smoothly when if I stream the audio directly from Spotify, without pairing it with bluetooth though. However, I have actual playlists saved on my sd card on my phone that I would like to stream sometimes. If it can't even function as a basic speaker, what's the point? I have tried resetting both my phone and the Echo. I have tried inserting a paper clip to the reset function on the bottom of the Echo as suggested and still the same issues arise.","Positive"
"7220","I love it!","Positive"
"7221","I LOVE my echo!!  It has surpassed my expectations with its helpful apps and tips.  Would highly recommend.","Positive"
"7222","Love Alexa","Positive"
"7223","Love it","Positive"
"7224","Love my Echo can wait to add other pieces to broad my Alexis and what she can do thank you","Positive"
"7225","I am considering telling the person I bought it from to ask for a refund and to put that refund into their retirement. As someone who doesn't like to talk much, this product forces you to talk at all steps of the order. Personal problems aside, I am not sure this does much else than something like Siri, and besides having a pillar of 360 degree sound, I would say the only function is a way for amazon to accidentally make money off of children accidentally ordering things. There is a problem with echo for the reason that it cannot stream YouTube on command, instead you have to use websites or services partnered with amazon for this release. It lacks the capabilities it needs to be a great piece of technology. If I could rate it true to what I consider it to be, I would rate it 0 out of 5 stars because I cannot understand how anyone would think this could be worth more than $50.","Positive"
"7226","Fun electronic equipment, recommend for everyone","Positive"
"7227","great","Positive"
"7228","Not having luck connecting amazon music or demo! Not many commands she recognizes.","Positive"
"7229","Sound quality seems good to my ancient ears and it is more than loud enough. It works fine for turning lights on and off, playing music on Amazon Prime, giving you the time and a host of other things. However it is not an AI. It only functions with a preselected list of questions. If you don't ask a question the proper way, it doesn't understand. Also internet searches other than a wiki search do not seem to work. So in comparison to OK Google it isn't quite as capable on the internet. However OK Google doesn't give me the answer I want more often than not, so it's not quite there yet either. On the other hand I was impressed by how well it recognized my voice and I have not used the voice training provided. My wife has a little more trouble with it however it still works quite well. It has difficulty if you talk too fast or you do not pause for 1/2 a second after using the wake up key word ""Alexa"". My main complaint is the lack of ability to do a general search for news or information on the web and it's inability to understand plain English commands that are not preprogrammed. Other than that, it's a good product and I recommend it.","Positive"
"7230","Alexa can be picky at times.","Negative"
"7231","this thing is great still learning what it can do","Positive"
"7232","Awesome! My wife uses it all the time.","Positive"
"7233","My husband loves this Echo. He listens to the misic on it and likes to hear the jokes. Now he also added Jeopardy to it.","Positive"
"7234","Very Fun! Great as a home school or homework aid. I am a new fan of the Echo and I occasionally have to remember how to reconstruct my words for Elexa if it don't understand them.","Positive"
"7235","I was expecting a sensor that read humidity as well.","Positive"
"7236","after a ton of research i purchased this for my disabled mother to help with activites, books, music etc.  You are limited to what you can do based on the apps they have, then you have to mention the app, you can't ask a question like you can do Siri on a phone, she doesn't understand, does work very well with audible, we kept asking Alexa to play Christian Hymns, and alexa doesn't understand, you have to build a playlist, you can link your google account to it, and ask Alexa what is on my calendar today, but you can't ask alexa to enter an appointment into the calendar, you can't ask alexa to add a contact or call a person, you have to do the entry web based.  Im really wondering if it would have been better to purchase the Google product......I can only hope Alexa expands its capabilities, especially working seamlessly with google accounts.","Positive"
"7237","It's a white echo, the color blends a little more into the room then the black one we have does. We turn Alexa on when we leave to keep the dogs from barking with every noise that comes from the street by having it play music. Also a great way to get an answer without having to bring up the computer or searching on the phones browser.","Positive"
"7238","I love it but am considering returning it because I didn't know it recorded  everything even when it's not engaged. After hearing on the news that it records everything, I've  been  uncomfortable with it in my home.-It's a form of spyware in my opinion.","Positive"
"7239","I really love my Echo although I almost sent it back because it left me 'hanging' for specific music I wanted to hear while using free iHeart radio.  I decided to try the Amazon Music 30 day free trial and I LOVE it!!  I've decided to keep my Echo and buy the Amazon Music for Echo for $3.99 per month. It's wonderful to just randomly blurt out music I want to hear,and there it is.  I was also expecting it to verbally remind me to do things at a certain time of day, which it does not do. One more thing, I would like to give it a name that I like, instead of Alexa, but it only gives 3 choices of names we can use. Other than those things, I really like it alot and am having fun with it.","Positive"
"7240","Almost useless! Unless you say exactly the right phrase she usually does not understand and will not provide the info! Also unfortunately it uses a proprietary database and does not actually look out on the WWW. Even asking a simple question, ""What temperature should I cook Chicken to?""  She just does not get.","Negative"
"7241","And the Skills...great if you can remember exactly what to say.....and remember that for each skill you would like to use.","Positive"
"7242","This is basically a speaker to play music and tell me the weather. Not worth it at all. My Cell phone does 1000% more and it works!","Positive"
"7243","It's probably a good product but we are returning this.  We do not see the reason to pay for this over an Echo dot, so we have gone with the dot.","Positive"
"7244","I expected ""Siri"" type results when asking questions. The typical response is ""I don't understand the question"" Alexa is not very smart","Positive"
"7245","Bought for someone else for Christmas.  Got a chance to see all Alexa does.  Great sound.  Now I want one.  Waiting for it to go on sale again :)","Positive"
"7246","""Alexa"" is great! We are getting used to each other and how to ask her questions. It makes us laugh because of how she responds sometimes. She has a lot of different apps that you can enable. The one we use the most so far is the Flash Briefing. We have yet to explore everything she is able to do, but we are very happy with our purchase.","Positive"
"7247","Gave it as a gift since we love ours so much. My inlaws love it too!","Positive"
"7248","Echo had some cool features, but would have been great if it was rechargeable and could be used on outings like camping or going to the lake. Instead I got a Bluetooth JBL speaker that was rechargeable and can take it wherever I go. My JBL has become permanent fixture on gatherings, outings etc. Echo is great if your looking for a stationary device for home, but is not for me.","Positive"
"7249","It gave me a look at the future.","Positive"
"7250","Bought it for a neighbor and she loves it!","Positive"
"7251","I received the white echo for Christmas and it is absolutely perfect! My whole entire family went crazy for this device and we all just had to have one. Alexa is a must have item for any household.","Positive"
"7252","I noticed in the picture the echo looks as it has a shiny gloss coat, but in reality it has more of a flat (no gloss) look to it. Which I prefer. Makes the quality look better.","Positive"
"7253","Now I use Alexa mainly for music which is perfect. I was using expensive UE Boom speakers but the Echo blew those out of the water. The best part is Alexa is can be completely hands free so she can change your stations or volume with ease. I loved using this while replacing in the bath! No more drying my hands just to change a song!","Positive"
"7254","P.S. Alexa tells pretty funny Chuck Norris jokes! Just ask!:D","Negative"
"7255","I love it!  I have a Bose radio and this is even better.  Two of my friends are so impressed that they had me order them one.  Mine is playing constantly.","Positive"
"7256","Not easy to use! Limited as what you can do with it has very specific things it will do and compatible only with certain technology. As far as asking it questions which is what I thought would be fun well forget about it. I would say 90% of the questions I ask I'm told it doesn't understand but when I speak it into google on my android phone and get a spoken response almost everytime. Spent your money on something else like google home.","Positive"
"7257","Super happy, bought 3 more, the dot. Dot is a smaller version, works as well.","Positive"
"7258","It's an interesting piece and simply a blast to have. I also bought Amazon music to go with it and been having fun ever since. It's basically vast knowledge at the tip of your tongue. Hopefully it will continue to update and get smarter. Great job Amazon!","Positive"
"7259","It was a Christmas gift that I was initially miffed with. We have every gadget known to mankind and didn't need another distraction. We got it home, opened the box and then {Cue theme song to The Jetsons} we had our own little piece of high end, highly usable technology. All I want to say is... you gotta try this.","Positive"
"7260","We're in love....she does it all, my favorite songs, my grocery list, to do list, whats on my calendar, what the news is, reads me my books and daily bible reading, wakes me up and plays lullabies when we're in bed, wakes me up with a really nice sound and times my cookies.  There are no words to our joy.....","Positive"
"7261","She plays ""it's a beautiful Day"" first thing every morning by Michael Buble.  THen tells us a joke.....what a world we live in!!!!!!","Positive"
"7262","Bought each of my kids on and they love it!!","Positive"
"7263","Great item","Positive"
"7264","Great shipping time, great product. I'm very happy with my Alexa :) the only thing is to play specific songs you need a prime membership and in some cases two different Amazon memberships? I'm not sure exactly but I just connect it to my Pandora just fine.","Positive"
"7265","Yep, Echo you are amazing!","Positive"
"7266","Fin l, useful product","Positive"
"7267","This thing does so many things so well it's just hard to describe it all.","Negative"
"7268","And, with Amazon Music Unlimited you can literally shout to Alexa to play practically anything ever recorded...and by album.","Negative"
"7269","And even Playlists (that you can create) can have anything in them (uploads too). Just have her play that playlist. Shuffle? no problem.","Negative"
"7270","Pause, resume, volume six, sleep timer, etc...all features work every time.","Positive"
"7271","It is awesome","Positive"
"7272","My son loved this, he was so excited about what all it would do.!!!","Positive"
"7273","Amazing","Positive"
"7274","We ended up returning the Echo.  You have to activate certain skills in order to ask questions about certain topics and there are so many of them.  Then you have to phrase your question in a specific way (using the exact words).  I found very little added value to having it. Also, I found the ""searches"" into Amazon for products to be very tedious and not useful.  I'm sure there are many folks out there that love it - it was just not for me.","Positive"
"7275","Not happy - had it for a year and the plate popped off the top. Can't get it to stay on and now I can't get it to work with wifi anymore. It is out of warranty.","Positive"
"7276","We love Alexa. She greets us in the morning and gives us a weather update.","Positive"
"7277","Love it!!!","Positive"
"7278","The future of home automation.  Alexsa comes in pretty handy believe it or not......","Positive"
"7279","Weather info, MY music, ordering Amazon products, all just a command away. Love the grocery list and to do list, I don't have to stop what I'm doing to write things down, just tell Alexa and keep doing what I was doing.","Positive"
"7280","I can't begin to tell you what a difference the echo has made to my disabled veteran husband. After his stroke, his mobility and speech were effected. giving him a whisper of a voice. He can now ask Alexa to play any song of his choosing without having to get up . And she recognizes his whisper of a voice. Can't wait to hook Alexa up to the household lights so my husband will have an easier time turning them on.","Positive"
"7281","The first time something worked as advertised. Great idea and great product. Just hope I don't go broke buying things that work with it. The sound is great.","Positive"
"7282","An amazing concept. When it works it is the best thing going in home automation. When it doesn't it's not even a decent paperweight. The setup for controlling devices in your home is VERY clunky. Each time you want to add a new device you have to start over from scratch, which shouldn't be the case. Hopefully this will be fixed!","Positive"
"7283","Love my echo ,works just like it said it did.","Positive"
"7284","Still playing the with the Echo so much fun .","Positive"
"7285","I love Alexa -- I use mainly as a music player and most of the music on amazon prime works out for me.","Positive"
"7286","However Alexa is not good at recognizing non English artist names or songs -- so listening to international music with her is a big challenge.","Positive"
"7287","Trying to pair alexa and trying skills....but overall....I am happy with this purchase. I will update the review in another 6 months.","Positive"
"7288","Lately I noticed it's not as responsive as is used to be. I can no longer turn off alarms by voice. And trying an other commands is now hit or miss. I'm lucky if it works 50% of the time.","Positive"
"7289","Great now will buy extra speaker","Positive"
"7290","Awesome product!","Positive"
"7291","Fun, informative, and entertaining.","Positive"
"7292","Received for Christmas and I love it!  Still trying to learn all it can do and I am amazed!","Positive"
"7293","Amazed at the technology in this device.  Everyone loves talking to her.  Great product.","Positive"
"7294","Good product. Search engine is terrible because it uses bing.  On the app you can see what she heard and she always hears the correct statement but cant ever find it because Bing is a bad search engine. Use it as speakers quite often and sound quality is great.  Kind of fun to just talk with her sometimes and very convenient when cooking because she can store multiple timers. Also can be very loud if you turn up volume. Want to get some of the add-ons so I can control lights in the house. Alexa has lots of extra features like the light/appliance control, this seems to be what the product is geared towards. That and music.","Positive"
"7295","great","Positive"
"7296","Very useful.","Positive"
"7297","This made someone the happiest kid at Christmas...love Alexa.","Positive"
"7298","Love the Alexa. I like that it continues to get smarter and they add on ways that you can use it.","Positive"
"7299","What the...? The Echo can set an alarm, the Echo can play music on demand, but it can't wake you up with music? Also when I command it to wake me up in a half hour or so to take a nap, that's the timer alarm which you can't change. So I try ""set an alarm for a half hour from now."" STILL the same annoying timer alarm. Seriously guys, I feel like I bought a cruise ticket for a massive entertainment ship but can't leave my room.  Who developed this thing? Tom Hanks from Castaway? I bought a $180 uncustomizable weather announcer, and I use free apps on my phone for everything else. Yay","Positive"
"7300","Be honest I love my Amazon Echo I have mine in my kitchen I listen to it every time I go in there to cook in another suggestion if you are getting an Amazon Echo I was just the Amazon Dot That is awesome too","Positive"
"7301","My son LOVES!!!!","Positive"
"7302","I was sorry to learn that I would have to pay for the unlimited music.  Alexa had a lot of down time and/or said that she would get back to us. Then we were totally unaware of this thing being able to record conversations in our home.  I didn't like that and we have returned the Echo.","Positive"
"7303","Once you get it set up and put the skills you want on it (from a PC is easiest), it works as advertised. Looking forward to more skills being added.","Positive"
"7304","its really amazing what Alexa can do!  It's fun just trying different things.","Positive"
"7305","Just love my Amazon Echo!","Positive"
"7306","I can't say enough how much we like our Echo.","Positive"
"7307","Love love love love can't say enough we laugh.. we love it ... Listen to music  set timers reminders ask questions or just for a joke .., ask her for a fart.. It's to much ... She is ariot","Positive"
"7308","Alexa has made a great addition in my apartment. I am using this in my living room along with an Echo Dot in my bedroom and they work together quite nicely. Both devices pick up your voice very easily, which is great, but sometimes the Dot from my bedroom will pick up my voice instead of the Echo, meaning I'll have to wait for the Dot to time out before talking to the Echo again. If I could add another note, this was a lot larger than I expected, so check the dimensions if you are planning on placing this somewhere tight. Can't recommend this enough however! Great sound, great at managing devices, and I almost never have an issue with it understanding what I'm saying like I would with Siri","Positive"
"7309","I've had the greatest fun setting up new skills and linking the unit to the smarthome.","Positive"
"7310","I love my Echo. I am very happy with the Item.","Positive"
"7311","After a little trouble setting it works great and it does more then I thought it would","Positive"
"7312","I am totally thrilled with this purchase!","Positive"
"7313","LOVE IT. use it everydaY","Positive"
"7314","Worked well for a year, now malfunctioning. Below average tech support for out of warranty units. I was asked to order  a new power adapter when my Echo stopped responding to ""Alexa.""  I said I had tried it with a working power adapter and there was no difference,  but I was still asked to wait for a week for the replacement, which of course did not work. After seven calls for assistance, I have given up. Now it is a $200 paper weight","Positive"
"7315","Loads of fun. Buy it, and you'll see what it's all about.","Positive"
"7316","This is amazing and clever!","Positive"
"7317","I must say after my initial thoughts, that I have fallen in love with Alexa and the Echo! She takes care of my home, keeps me informed of the latest news and plays my music!","Negative"
"7318","A fantastic product.  Speech Recognition is excellent, and with Alexa ""she"" can integrate with a very wide variety of Smart-Home devices.  I have Echo/Alexa hooked up to control my Philips Hue lighting, for example.  She's always a great companion to have around when you want to hear some music, or ask questions about the weather, sports, or nearly anything.  She'll even tell you some jokes.","Positive"
"7319","I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she seems to be enjoying it. I am really excited for her to learn all the things it can do. It arrived on my birthday (Jan.3). Must have had Alexa sing Happy Birthday 6 times. My wife had to grin and bear it. 2 comments about buying my experience. One with the purchase. I purchased this right before Christmas when it went on sale for about $50 off. Since I am a Prime member I thought It would arrive by Christmas. It was not until after I had placed my order was I informed that it was on ""back order"" and wouldn't arrive until after Christmas. I was disappointed but the savings were a real value. Second, my wife wasn't as aware of the Echo as I am. So I was disappointed with the lack of visual and informative packaging included with the Echo itself. It really did nothing to excite her or even entice her with the possibilities of she had in store once it was hooked up. Also, even though the amazon website is optimized for cellphones you really need a laptop or tablet to see the various imagery and tutorials that introduce Alexa's many features. That said my wife was easily able to follow the instructions to get Alexa paired up to our wifi and is learning and loading more apps daily. The sound is great and the volume will fill the room and then some. I'm sure the more we use the Echo the more we will come to enjoy and appreciate it.","Positive"
"7320","I really do like the concept but most times Alexa dose not have the answer I need... I really wish","Positive"
"7321","she had access to Google search so I didn't have to go to my phone or PC and look it up. I really like the","Positive"
"7322","the Ask My Buddy App. makes me feel a little more safe I just hope it works if I ever need it, also getting ready","Positive"
"7323","to change over the light bulbs!!! can't wait to see how this feature works.","Negative"
"7324","LOVE THIS. I keep it in my living room. I use it all the time. Recognizes my voice. Also, love that it also came with a white cord (which my white Echo Dot did not).","Positive"
"7325","Awesome product","Positive"
"7326","Alexa is a very fun and useful tool.  I can see a future where many home devices are controlled from this (or similar) device.  Great job Amazon !","Positive"
"7327","Who doesn't like Echo? I use it for radio every day -- local and international -  and for that alone it's worth the price.","Positive"
"7328","Love this electronic.  Not as smart as Siri but hopefully one day.","Positive"
"7329","This is great. I love it.  I bought each one for my children (grown in their own homes) and bought the dot for my office desk.","Positive"
"7330","Works like new.  Saved money.  Great purchase.  Love Alexa!","Positive"
"7331","Not worth the money over the Echo Dot. Returned product.","Positive"
"7332","I'm sure this will continue to get better as time goes on, but I was somewhat disappointed for a first blush impression. Her knowledge seems very limited right now to Wikkipedia and specific apps.  Most of the questions we asked she responds that she doesn't have an answer or doesn't know.  (I'm assuming she isn't even drawing from google - example Alexa doesn't know when a single Tennis event is scheduled (we tried asking about every single major).  Most of the time if my daughter asks ""what do whales sound like"" she pulls up band (""Wales""?) instead of doing the ""Splash"" dialogue - which in itself is disappointing because when that dialogue does work, there's no whale sounds, just the information that they are musicians of the sea....","Positive"
"7333","The app is horrible.  I had to ""set up"" my app 3 times in the same day and finally uninstalled and reinstalled.  The interaction is very clunky.  The app alone could make me return this device.  It freezes up, resets (forces you to set up again), uses something called ""cards"" but without explanation of what they are.","Negative"
"7334","I am a big fan of Amazon products and I really want to like this device, but first impressions aren't great.","Positive"
"7335","The Pros: She's great at telling you the weather, setting your volume, suggesting play lists, and dimming lights.  This COULD be an amazing product, but it needs some work. Great range and voice recognition. Ties into a lot of common services like Pandora etc.","Positive"
"7336","The Cons: Gaps in ""common"" knowledge, the worst app I have ever used on an iphone, and no way to use itunes or google music libraries.","Negative"
"7337","Really a wonderful item.  Just remember, remote functions such as lights require remote receivers in order to work","Positive"
"7338","Not very useful. Pretty basic in function. Ok Google is much more intelligent. Often just get a reply of ""hmm I don't understand..."".","Positive"
"7339","It was a gift and they love it","Positive"
"7340","There were certainly some cadence issues when I first used the Echo (you can't be like "" Hey Alexa...er..ah..erm..oh!..play X on spotify"" because she is so totally over you by then. Perhaps this device teaches you to think before you speak? And to be decisive in commanding what you want out of life. Wow. Deep","Positive"
"7341","This is a great unit, we love using it for music, lists, homework etc","Positive"
"7342","Bought two as gifts for family members and they are enjoying it tremendously.  Especially the feature where you can ask Alexa to play a song.","Positive"
"7343","I bought these for my sons for Christmas. They love them!","Positive"
"7344","I love my Echo!  Just saying....","Positive"
"7345","I loved my new Echo for the one day that it worked!  Since the day after Christmas it kept needing to be re-setup everytime I used it, until today when it stopped working all together!  After spending over an hour on the phone with Amazon Echo customer service they decided that the microphone was faulty and had stopped working.  They are sending me a new one but not until Jan 30th!!!  That means I have to wait 25 days for the replacement.  I am amazed that Amazon did not stock some for replacements when there is bound to be some number of defective units.  I consider that to be a poor customer service decision.","Positive"
"7346","Coolest thing I've ever owned.","Positive"
"7347","This Echo is possessed by an internal glitch. It randomly turns on and makes a noise similar to the Jaws theme song. It does it at night, during mute, even while a song is playing on it and it is louder than the song volume playing. No light turns on. It just makes this noise at different times of the day and night every day.","Negative"
"7348","Amazon support had enough do a factory reset a guaranteed it would fix the problem.  Guess what? IT'S BACK!!!","Positive"
"7349","Sounds good for a small speaker system... voice recognition is helpful via tablet.","Positive"
"7350","We are having fun learning what Alexa can do. Music sounds great.","Positive"
"7351","I've had my Alexa for about 9 months now and love her!!! She's so handy for shopping lists, timers, playing Tune In radio, and telling jokes, and that's only the tip of the iceberg!  There are a million more features that I haven't even gotten to using, but am planning to in the future, such as the audio books and smart home commands for turning on lights. I would definitely recommend Alexa...and she's sooooo much better than Siri!!!!","Positive"
"7352","love","Positive"
"7353","Having fun figuring this out and all that Alexa can do.","Positive"
"7354","Love Alexa !","Positive"
"7355","A Christmas gift for our son. He is enjoying it and it is doing everything promised.","Positive"
"7356","My ECHO was a Christmas Present, that I got for Myself. I was excited to see, what this Personal Assistant, ALEXA, could do to make My life better & more fun. First, I looked for a Guide Book, or, at least a good Quick Start Guide in the nice box. Only, a  tiny, 3""x3"" folder, with print, so small that a magnifier is needed to read it? Seems, it is necessary to purchased a Guide Book, for another $10 is needed? Set-up was difficult, linking it to My WiFi was confusing, and the Voice Training had to be repeated several times. I understand, that this is a new use of Artificial Intelligence in the Smart Home, but for the money, in My opinion, it just isn't worth the trouble. Knowing that, AMAZON is always easy to work with, I'm returning this ECHO. I'll wait for a updated one to become available. Thanks!","Positive"
"7357","2nd Ipad,  2nd cover. Great protection.  Love it.","Positive"
"7358","I love my echo!","Positive"
"7359","Excellent product. Very impressive capability.  R.D.A.","Positive"
"7360","Love this tool!  Speaker is adequate for one or two room listening.... Set up took 5 minutes.","Positive"
"7361","Great product and came fast","Positive"
"7362","Easy to set up.","Positive"
"7363","Haven't figure out all the jargon yet, but I love it!","Positive"
"7364","This is a must have for anyone who loves electronics.  With Amazon Music it is even better.  We even added our IHeartRadio app to it as well.  We went to best buy and bought a Google Home and returned it because it was nothing compared to this.  The sound quality is crisp and adding extra Bluetooth speakers to it was easy.  I also like the app for this as well to see which song is playing.  I hope that soon they will allow search features n the app.","Positive"
"7365","2. The perfect gift for my Husband as he is hard to find something for.","Negative"
"7366","3. At the time I really didn't know what it did, but he kept telling me before I purchased this that he really would like to have one.  I have since found out Alexa is very helpful.","Positive"
"7367","4. One down fall, my Husband has a small speech impediment and this product had a hard time understanding him at times. We are working more in training mode at times for her to understand what he's saying.","Negative"
"7368","5. I do enjoy the audio sound coming out. Her voice is very pleasant to listen to. Sounds like a real person not a programmed/computer voice.","Positive"
"7369","6. I'm an avid reader, I plan on purchasing a book and have her reading it aloud.","Positive"
"7370","Love my Echo.  It works great and I use it quite a bit for local information.","Positive"
"7371","7. I would highly recommend this product to others.","Positive"
"7372","I can't locate the person that asked me if this product is capable of answering the cell phone. I looked this question and found the answer in the Help Costumer F&Q area. Here is the answer they give.","Positive"
"7373","Amazon Device Support   Echo Help  Echo Connectivity","Positive"
"7374","Your Echo is Bluetooth-enabled so you can stream popular audio services (like iTunes or Google Play Music) from a mobile device (such as your phone or tablet).","Positive"
"7375","Say, ""Pair."" Alexa lets you know that Echo is ready to pair.","Positive"
"7376","LOVE IT!!! Absolutely legit!!! Does so many things for one small device!! :) a must have and i would totally buy this gadget again!!","Positive"
"7377","Open the Bluetooth settings menu on your mobile device, and select your Echo. Alexa tells you if the connection is successful. You are now ready to stream audio from your mobile device to Echo.","Positive"
"7378","Love it!  It was bigger than I was thinking it would be.  We got a Tap and a Dot also.  Definitely the biggest!","Positive"
"7379","Love love love Alexa. You can ask Alexa anything. She can keep a ""to do"" list as well as a grocery list. You can access the lists through your phone app while at the store. It's a great resource. I play my audible books through Alexa while I'm buzzing through the house. It's easier than wearing headphones that get caught on cabinets and things.","Positive"
"7380","you can't go wrong with this. GR8 for kids as a learning tool","Negative"
"7381","Lots of fun watching friends playing with it. Nice to have, enjoy it.","Positive"
"7382","Echo is so much fun.  I initially ordered the black and then gave it to family.  They love it too. The sound quality is great.  I loved it so much, I ordered the white and the Dot for another room.  I hope Alexa continues to get more skills. The only thing and it is not a negative, I hesitate choosing too many skills as I wish there was a better way to make sure the developer is a ""safe"" one.  Have had enough problems with viruses, etc.  How can we tell?","Positive"
"7383","great works excellent!","Positive"
"7384","I would like to start off by saying I love my echo!  It has been extremely handy for me, however,  A couple of issues have come up.","Positive"
"7385","The biggest issue was  The plastic on the top coming apart.","Negative"
"7386","I did contact Amazon customer service however, and they sent me a replacement.","Positive"
"7387","Sound quality isn't very good in my opinion,  it will get the job done if you're just listening to news and things like that.","Positive"
"7388","I love it for controlling lights, getting news,  whether, and basic information.","Positive"
"7389"," It is easy to set up,  and other than the issue mentioned above, I have had no issues with it.","Negative"
"7390","BOUGHT AS A GIFT, NO COMPLAINTS SO FAR","Negative"
"7391","We love our Echo and how it has wiggled its way into our lifestyle. There isn't a hour/day/ that goes by that she (Alexa) isn't tasked with doing something. Setup is so easy, anyone who can read and follow directions will successfully have their Echo up and running with minimal time and effort.  We have integrated her into our home with many, many compatible devices which work flawlessly and are making plans for further expansion. The sky is the limit!!!  We especially enjoyed all the Christmas Music, from Amazon Music, we listened to during the Holidays. Just remember, when you loose your internet connection, she will not function.  So, you'll have to fall back to the old fashion method of using a switch.","Positive"
"7392","Good speaker but the stupid thing is ""deaf"" when the volume is over 6. Stick with the dot.","Negative"
"7393","LOVE IT!!!","Positive"
"7394","Awesome, I love it!","Positive"
"7395","My son loves it. still learning new things to do with it.","Positive"
"7396","Wow.  Love it more ham I thought I would.  Great shopping list and to do list tracker.  Use it for daily alarm, all of it.  Liked it so much got a white one for sons dorm.","Positive"
"7397","she can piss me off. she is quick and can be very useful. amazon just needs to make her smarter","Positive"
"7398","We love Alexa!","Positive"
"7399","My Amazon Echo/Dot review:  Just before Christmas I decided to join the hands free digital assistant revolution.  I ordered two Dots and an Echo for my 1002 square foot condo.  They were on sale but on back order - the projected delivery date was January 14th.  Okay, they're for me, $10 off each Dot and $40 off the Echo, no rush.  I was pleasantly surprised to receive the Dots on December 26th and the Echo today (January 4th).  Set up was super easy.  I already had the app on my phone so it took no time for the Dots.","Positive"
"7400","I did change the name of the Dots to Kitchen Dot and Bedroom Dot - 1st Dot and 2nd Dot were just too confusing.  It did take me a while (who knows why - short between the operator and the keyboard maybe) to find the zip code/location change screen - it's on the settings page in the App.  About four minutes after plugging in the Echo I realized that it and the Kitchen Dot were just a smidge too close to each other, so I updated the wake word on the Echo to Echo (it sits near the TV so, that should fix Alexa commercial wake ups too).","Negative"
"7401","Streaming Spotify is super easy - even with my braces/lisp. Actually, I'm pretty amazed how even without doing much of the voice training, just how well the system understands me.  I speak softly, my voice is a little high, and new braces mean voicemail systems hang up on me and audio customer service menus don't understand me at all - once running on any of the units, you can easily change radio station or playlist either vocally or via the Spotify app.  I'm not sure I'm ready to go Amazon Unlimited yet, I'll have to play with it for a while.  I need to be able to create my own playlists and I love ""radio"" stations based off of a single track that introduce me to new artists.  I haven't seen that available in Music Unlimited.  I am a little disappointed in the speaker quality of the Dot, it seems a bit tinny.  But, I connected to a better existing Bluetooth speaker in the bedroom and it's fine.","Positive"
"7402","My two favorite features are really simple ones but they mean a lot: I cook.  I really like to cook.  I can ask Alexa to set a timer while my hands are full and she does it and confirms it has been set.  Oh my goodness. Bake cookies and set the timer with the oven mitt on?  Pan/plate/pot in hand?  Love it.  The Dot in the kitchen is loud enough I can hear the timer in the living room over the dishwasher and the TV.  The other is the ability to add items to a shopping list whenever I think of the item.  In the kitchen, the living room, the bedroom - if I remember, I can ask Alexa to add the item and she does and confirms it has been added! No digging for a piece of paper that just gets left behind, or a pen, or opening an app on the phone *sigh* I'm feeling rather spoiled.","Positive"
"7403","I haven't gotten any of the linked outlets yet, but I will soon.  I recently purchased a set of five outlets with two remotes that I love - I can only imagine how much I will like a voice active option.","Positive"
"7404","One issue I have - and I know it's one others have addressed - but linked Dots/Echo options would be very nice.  I would love the ability to sync all timers/music/alarms with an Echo and a Dot or two - of course the option to sync, not an automatic or for.  A Dot in a child's room doesn't need to be sync'd to the Echo in the living room - but the option to be able to sync that kitchen timer, music for a get together, etc. on the fly would be fantastic!","Positive"
"7405","Don't waste your money","Negative"
"7406","Otherwise - so much fun!","Positive"
"7407","PERFECT FOR ALL YOUR QUESTIONS AND ENTERTAINMENT NEEDS !!!!!!","Positive"
"7408","Love it","Positive"
"7409","I just love it","Positive"
"7410","Fun item","Positive"
"7411","Love it","Positive"
"7412","Love it just wish it was wireless.","Positive"
"7413","We really like our new Amazon Echo.  Initial set up was easy.  We are now working on setting up some of the more advanced features which are a bit more complex.","Positive"
"7414","amazing !! love it, use it daily","Positive"
"7415","I have not been completely satisfied with the Amazon Echo.  Sometimes it does not work properly.  Not as satisfied with it as I have been with other Amazon products.","Positive"
"7416","Best thing I ever bought..yeah to Amazon!","Positive"
"7417","For the wife, she loves it.","Positive"
"7418","I have very low expectations for Alexa, and l was not disappointed. Great for playing music, fair for purchases, but really poor responding to anything that is not exactly in the syntax programmed. I am keeping Alexa in the hopes she will improve, but I am not optimistic.","Positive"
"7419","""Sorry, I cant find the answer to the question I heard.""  im getting REAL sick and tired of hearing that response to questions that this device SHOULD know and be able to find.  From what I hear, google home, can find and answer more things because its tapped into the google web browser itself but you know what?, ECHO should be able to do the same darn thing even it it ISNT tapped into google specifically.  I mean it DOES have access to the internet in a pretty much equal capacity right? It should be able to bring up and tell you about anything thats available on the internet, PERIOD.  AMAZON FIX THIS!  Other than that, I am still giving it 3 stars because I love everything else its able to do. Again though Amazon, that stuff thats not working as it should at the moment, really shouldnt be that hard to get working. Its simple stuff. Dont make me have to through my echo and three echo dots in the trash and go get Google Home. I went with you because I thought you'd be ahead of the game being that you came out with this stuff TWO YEARS before google and anyone else did.","Negative"
"7420","Alexa is the 5th member of our household at this point. So easy to operate even my 4yr old talks to her. Very happy with this purchase","Positive"
"7421","Great fun. Still learning Alexa's skills","Positive"
"7422","Very fun..  Love having it just a voice away.","Positive"
"7423","I LOVE Alexa! Bought her because I had no radio anymore.  I LOVE the ability to say play this play that..... no hands. LOVE LOVE LOVE","Positive"
"7424","my husband loves his echo","Positive"
"7425","Great!","Positive"
"7426","Love it!","Positive"
"7427","It's an amazing piece of technology.  I've only used a few of it's capabilities (to play music, give weather predictions, set a timer, and so forth).  I know there is much more I could be using it for, but even so it's very handy for quick answers to questions.","Positive"
"7428","I bought this as a Christmas present for my husband and he liked it.","Positive"
"7429","The one thing that I find undesirable--in fact, quite creepy--is that it ""listens"" to sounds in its environment.  (Note the recent request made to Amazon to provide information that could be helpful in a murder investigation.  The Echo was in the room during the murder and presumably recorded sounds that might be clues.  This was reported in the Washington Post shortly after Christmas 2016.)","Negative"
"7430","A very nice ""toy"".  It works with my prime music.  Learning new skills every day","Positive"
"7431","It does not work for Canada, totally disappointed for that. Also there are several other issues.","Negative"

"7433","The good,","Positive"
"7434","1) Sound quality is good","Positive"
"7435","2) Microphone is quite sensitive","Positive"
"7436","3) Understand accented commands well","Positive"
"7437","Cute device; got it as a gift from my kid. Alexa won't play my itunes library unless I upload it all to Amazon Music (for a fee) or pair it with my iPad or iPhone. Everything else Echo/Alexa does I could already do with Siri on my iPhone or iPad. What a crock! This is nothing more than an expensive bluetooth speaker.","Positive"
"7438","This is one of the best things I treated myself to. I love the voice activation for playing music along with my prime memebership","Positive"
"7439","usefull for some functions - controlling lamps, traffic info.  Insists on telling me the weather at a location 20 miles away and 1000 feet lower in altitude.  you cannot configure location to known federal weather stations that are less than a mile from the house.","Positive"
"7440","it's ok as a music player but that seems to be about it unless you have special lights installed in your house or other smart devices that work along with it.  she is pretty dumb though when you ask her questions.  i get a lot of ""i can't really comment on that"" responses when asking her questions.  Also, she is pretty dumb about finding music.  I have had several instances so far (only had it a week) where she can't find a song that I am looking right at on my amazon music app.  not super impressed so far.  i really hope they work on the internet searching capabilities.  she doesn't seem to know a lot about anything.","Positive"
"7441","The echo is one of the biggest disappointments I've ever had in electronics, a total waste of money too. Alexa can't figure out where Jfk international airport is. It will not do any traffic for me. The shopping list option sucks. I can't delete things off it, and have to say ""Alexa put this on my shopping list"" for every single item. It won't tell me the weather in the town I live in. Yes, I do have the app, and yes I tried to personalize it. My kids don't even like the Echo. I can't wait to return it. If you've ever used Google, the Echo will drive you crazy.","Negative"
"7442","Love my Echo ... Its given us hours of enjoyment...","Positive"
"7443","As good as Alexa is now, there's room for improvement. One of the biggest features I wish Alexa had was recipe instructions-weird, I know, but hear me out. I cook nearly every day, and I would love to be able to follow a recipe for baba ganoush simply by saying, ""Alexa, next"" as she reads the instructions aloud. Right now, Alexa doesn't even know recipes exist really. When I asked, ""Alexa, how do you make chocolate chip cookies?"" she told me she didn't know the answer. The app reflected that by pointing me to a Bing search page for that question.","Positive"
"7444","A more universal feature I'd like to see is speakerphone. It would be great if I could answer an incoming call via Echo and use it as a speakerphone while in my home making dinner or getting ready to go out. The ability to have my texts and e-mails read aloud would be welcome, too. I wouldn't want Alexa to chime in unexpectedly every time I got a text message or e-mail, but being able to say ""Alexa, read my newest text message"" would be convenient.","Positive"
"7445","I think the main reason I never use Siri is that I have a smartphone that can tell me everything she could and more. I also don't want to draw attention to myself in public in that way. Why would I talk to a disembodied voice on my phone and have strangers stare at me when I can just as easily tap it out quietly on the screen? Unless you're on the phone with someone, there just aren't that many things that require you to talk to your phone. And chances are you've probably mastered typing on your smartphone to the point where busting out a question in Google takes seconds.","Positive"
"7446","Alexa is different from Siri on a phone because she's confined to your home; you don't have to deal with strangers when using her and might not have your phone in your pocket everywhere you go in your house. Being able to talk to something stationary that's not tied to your smartphone actually does make some things easier at home. It's not just about being able to turn off your smart light bulbs by asking Alexa to do it for you-Alexa kind of becomes a life assistant when used to her fullest potential.","Positive"
"7447","The most obvious people who would love Echo and Alexa are those who want a new home speaker and are also intrigued by voice control. My parents bought an Echo months ago, and my mother uses it mostly to play Justin Timberlake albums during the day. While my parents love the Echo's speaker, they purchased it with my brother in mind. He's autistic and speaks choppily, making him sometimes hard to understand. He'll speak to Alexa, ask her questions about the weather, and if Alexa responds, my parents know his speech is improving.","Positive"
"7448","Obscure uses like that make me believe there's a ton of potential in voice assistants that hasn't been tapped yet. And currently, Echo and Alexa are even the voice assistant duo of choice for people like me who haven't fallen in love with mobile voice assistants. Do I depend on Alexa in the same way that I do my smartphone? No, but I'm perfectly happy with Alexa at home. She assists me with simple household chores and adds to my day with things like the Flash Briefing and easy music controls-and she does it without making me pause to interact with my phone. Confining Alexa to the home gives her a clear purpose. Because of that, fellow naysayers who have been skeptical of Siri and Cortana may actually enjoy talking to her, too.","Positive"
"7449","The Good","Positive"
"7450","Voice recognition is solid and commands work well-ask and you shall receive from Alexa.","Positive"

"7459","Alexa app is in need of a serious redesign, as it's the only non-voice interface Echo has.","Positive"
"7460","fun","Positive"
"7461","Great sound quality and Alexa is very responsive. Alexa's software or search engine could use some updating as several questions cannot be answered or must be asked various ways before receiving an answer.","Positive"
"7462","Works very well. Devices can't hear at loud sound levels.","Positive"
"7463","My husband loves it!","Positive"
"7464","very good product which lived up to expectations","Positive"
"7465","It hasn't wowed me yet. It Can do almost everything my smartphone can.  I have concected a smort home or a smart car to it so I havent seen its full potential but once I do, then I will be able to write a more in depth review. For now it does the functions that i purchased it for ; music, simple questions. Wish it made calls.","Positive"
"7466","Works best with a prime membership.  Also has to be plugged in.  No battery","Positive"
"7467","Super Cool. The future is here. Very useful and the speaker is pretty loud.","Positive"
"7468","This thing is so awesome. I have added the Amazon Music for $3.99 which is convenient instead of connecting through my phones bluetooth. Would of gave it 5 stars but it needs some kind of ""Google"" search program since she seems to get stumped sometimes. Overall great smart assistant.","Positive"

"7470","Love my Alexa, It is everything I wanted and more. Can't wait to try lots of other commands with the Echo.","Negative"
"7471","We ask questions and sometimes she does not even answer. We have turned up volume but that does not help. Not sure what is wrong. Would not buy again.","Negative"
"7472","My wife loves the convenience of this product. She can't wait to purchase additional products that will work with this one.","Positive"
"7473","I'm very satisfied with my Echo.  It was very easy to set up. I play music much more often now.","Positive"
"7474","Welcome to a total invasion of privacy! It is a fantastic idea bastardized by the child of Hitler and Stalin. I knew it was going to happen but the extent they do it is what is the most shocking...Records everything said...seriously??!","Positive"
"7475","If Amazon would like to steal all of my personal information to resell to 3rd parties perhaps the product should be free and we should collect 90% of the profits made from the resell of ""Our"" information.","Positive"
"7476","Loved, loved, loved my amazon echo, right up until it died a midnight on new years eve.  Lasted 15 months, or just 3 months past the warranty period.  R.I.P... was hoping for more.","Positive"
"7477","Awesome gift and such fun!!","Positive"
"7478","Fascinated with Alexa. Would prefer to have unlimited access to music without having to pay extra for that though....","Positive"
"7479","It doesn't get any better than this!  Love Love Love","Positive"
"7480","Fun to use, even fun to learn to use. Still learning but has been good so far. There is a lot of good info available to learn from. So we really enjoy it.","Positive"
"7481","Love it!!!","Positive"
"7482","Excellent device that was delivered on time and is very useful.","Positive"
"7483","Simply love it","Positive"
"7484","The Dot is everything the Echo is, except that the Echo has higher quality speakers without the connectivity capabilities of the much less expensive Dot. If you want quality sound for the price of an Echo, buy a Dot and a Bose speaker.","Positive"
"7485","great on sale purchase price, having a great time, another Amazon first","Positive"
"7486","The Eco is the greatest thing ever invented!!  Would recommend to anyone!!","Positive"
"7487","I cant get enough of this thing..  I have one in each room and converted my entire house to a smart house.  My parents loved it so much I set them up with it too.","Positive"
"7488","Great item, still finding what it will do.","Positive"
"7489","really do like this.  The things the Echo can do is amazing.  It being refurbished did not bother me one bit!","Positive"
"7490","Love it","Positive"
"7491","We love our Amazon Echo. So much fun to play Jeopardy and 20 questions. Great tool to use to play music, to play guided meditation, and ask for any information. Highly recommended!","Positive"
"7492","My husband bought me an Echo for Christmas.  I have had my echo for almost a week, and I feel duped by Amazon.  I was expecting something more along the lines of Siri, or Google, but instead I have what amounts to as a glorified speaker.  You have to enable skills from the Alexa app, and if Alexa doesn't know the answer, she tells you to go check it out on her app!  WTF???  Really Amazon?  If I'd wanted to do that, I'd have gone to my tablet and asked Google in the first place.","Positive"
"7493","Amazon should have tried to enter this big tech world with a product that was worthy of being in the big leagues.  I'm really disappointed in the product, but even worse, my confidence level in Amazon is waning.","Negative"
"7494","Very nice","Positive"
"7495","My son bought this for me because I enjoyed it at his house.  I love to call up a song and work in the kitchen and love the list features as well - and ordering.  NOW it's going to be 3.99 a month for music?  I also bought 3 kindle fires for Christmas and especially for the older grandson to get music through his dad's prime.  Now, apparently that is going to be 8.99 a month for him as well (for music).  FALSE ADVERTISING Amazon - I've passed on the benefits of Amazon Prime and Kindle and now Kindle Fire to my family and friends for a while - not happy with these changes at all.  We pay for prime!","Positive"
"7496","Everything as advertised. Great tool and info source.","Positive"
"7497","Based on the advertisement, I expected a lot more functionality.  A friend has it and we were amazed that it could play music, answer questions, etc.  It seems that the functionality only works if you have Amazon Prime (we do not).  And it can't do simple arithmetic.  I would have been better off with the google version.","Positive"
"7498","So happy with the echo, and all it can do, the speakers are amazing for no bigger than it is.  We love using it, makes shopping a lot easier with the shopping list.  Had trouble with the app opening on my phone, but after going to the help site it was an easy fix.  Now no more leaving my list at home.  Husband has TD Ameritrade and his weather, and I have everything else.","Positive"
"7499","Life changing for all of us but especially out 90 yr old dad.  It is intuitive.  He starts a shopping list for us.  It is a great item for anyone with mobility or dexterity issues.  We also have 3 Dots and just ordered another Dot for our brother who has had multiple strokes.","Positive"
"7500","Not happy with the way the music sounds while playing, sounds muffled. Not sure if I should return yet.","Positive"
"7501","The Echo is great. It has to learn new things but it is easy to use.","Positive"
"7502","I received this for Christmas and have been having fun figuring out what it can do. Next step is to start adding smart devices to my house to have the Echo communicate with.","Positive"
"7503","I found a quirk with Alexa, she offers a funny response if you ask ""Alexa, play splish splash I was taking a bath.""  :)","Positive"
"7504","Alexa is awesome.  We still haven't had time to play with it a whole lot, but so far we love it.","Positive"
"7505","awesome!!!","Positive"
"7506","Bought this for my husband for Christmas. Big mistake, he is not a tech guy, so we tried to get it to work for him, but if you don't have a smart phone, it is very hard for average person to use. It would not play Merle Haggard for him, nor could country be found. Very frustrating for him and the family, Back it went. Amazon was very speedy in our refund. Thank you for that.","Positive"
"7507","I use several Alexa apps and listen to music on Pandora with the Amazon Echo. It does have some bugs that need fixing, such as apps crashing or syncing with an app then stating it's unavailable, but I haven't had much trouble at all. It's a lot of fun to have around.","Negative"
"7508","Alexa is great to have around. I can't wait to add more smart pieces around my house for her to be able to control.","Positive"
"7509","Really cool and fun product. I have yet to take full advantage of integrating into a ""smart home"" type environment, which was/is the intent of the purchase.  I have no reason to think that won't work well, as ""Alexa"" does a very good job picking up on voices from a fairly good distance and doesn't seem to have trouble will different people's cadence or accents.  While I haven't used the Google Home, I would probably expect it to have more ""answers"" than Alexa, as Alexa seems to struggle with some basic questions.  But most people are going to use to get whether, get news, turn out lights, set alarms and timers, etc, all of which work very well. I like the ""skills"" (these are akin to ""applications"" for a mobile phone) which give additional capabilities, such as looking up recipes, etc.","Positive"
"7510","so easy to set up and very responsive to my request.","Positive"
"7511","I got this for task management and only task management. But it reverses the proper order from Todoist and I'm sending it back. It always gives me the most recent tasks, giving no preference to what is due. I want to do my oldest first, and I will never get to old tasks if I am only doing my latest tasks. Whoever configured this does not use a task list, I'm sure.","Positive"
"7512","Great sound!","Positive"
"7513","If you are looking for a personal assistant or something to answer even basic questions, you will have to look elsewhere, like Cortana, Google or Siri.  The Echo has been able to correctly understand and answer only a small percentage of the questions we have put to it.  And the answers it gives are dreadfully terse.  If it understands your question (the 1st hurdle), then you are still more likely to receive a ""cannot find an answer to your question"" (2nd hurdle).  If you do receive an actual answer (to the question you actually asked and not some other thing she thought you said) then your response will be extremely limited; just a sentence or two usually.","Positive"
"7514","Whereas, Cortana, Google & Siri all frequently give rather lengthy descriptions by comparison. Amazon's tech support will then inform you that they don't give lengthy verbal responses.  For any actually usable response you must install the Alexa app onto your computer, phone or tablet!  Which, of course, means that you would have been smart not to have bothered with the Echo at all and just asked your computer, phone or tablet in the first place.","Negative"
"7515","Good product, but is lacking tons of information. If you don know the exact way to ask a question you will get no response and the 'skills' section is lacking....but the bright side is that I'm sure the skills will continue to be added and grow, so over all its a cool ""toy"" for now, but hopefully wil turn into a great ""tool"". I would also suggest keeping it ON MUTE since it collects all of your spoken words in Amazons database. To me privacy is becoming more and more of an issue in the products we buy (not even sure if keeping it on mute will prevent it from storing sounds at all) buy the remote and keep it on mute and only tell it what you want it to hear.","Positive"
"7516","Unfortunately, with the recent court revelations that Jeff Bezos actually keeps all Echo recordings indefinitely (no precise clarifications yet as to whether this data is strictly limited to questions asked of Alexa or everything within its range whenever it is on and the microphone not muted). However, unlike reputable companies such as Apple, Amazon keeps all this unspecified voice data uniquely associated with the account holder's full personal information!","Negative"
"7517","So where legally responsible competitors remove ALL uniquely identifiable information from saved voice data, Amazon keeps tabs on all of its users and their associated voice data!  A legal nightmare potential for anyone who values at least a modicum of civil rights or cares about not only their privacy, but any of their visitors as well.","Positive"
"7518","Unlike Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, Jeff Bezos has stated that Amazon will comply with any and all subpoenas and warrants for full voice data with account holder's personal contact information.  So while with Apple your data can't be tied to you and is therefore useless to criminal hackers, stalkers or even the governments of the world; Amazon is a potential goldmine to hackers & thieves.  Not to mention Communist governments, Muslim Sharia courts & dictators around the world depending upon your devices location.","Negative"
"7519","As for a device to stream your previously purchased music library, there are countless other reviews detailing fixed limits to the maximum number of songs that an Echo can handle. As well as extreme difficulties other users keep experiencing trying to get specific songs or song lists to play properly.","Positive"
"7520","Then there is the alarming increase in recent posts of Echo devices suddenly no longer able to connect to the internet after a year or more. Then Amazon will inform you that you must buy a new one with only a $10, or if you're lucky maybe a $20, discount!","Positive"
"7521","End result, a total waste of money for a device we simply cannot trust given its current Amazon practices & policies. So now it sits unplugged in a closet.  Great potential, egregiously implemented!","Positive"
"7522","Neat idea . It has a lot of difficulty understanding my southern accent. It also is much more limited in what it can preform than I had anticipated.","Negative"
"7523","I use this like very day for time to current events to music. It controls my lighting system. Get current email to what new things that Alexa can do.","Positive"
"7524","my biggest inconvenient : it comes plugged without a battery. Bought separately the battery is another $100. Voice recognition - not as great either. I am still enjoying the device but a little under expectations.","Positive"
"7525","I love it. It's everything I thought it would be. The sound  is superb","Positive"
"7526","Love the Echo, own two of them.","Positive"
"7527","So amazing!","Positive"
"7528","I love my Amazon Echo the only thing I don't like is that you have to remember all the names of the apps/skills to get her to do anything instead of just telling her what you want and her figuring out which one of the skills to use.","Positive"
"7529","it also it seems like more often than not I have to repeat myself two or three times to get her to turn the light on and off and she says okay each time because she understands me","Positive"
"7530","but nothing happenes.....and that may be winks fault more than it is hers","Negative"
"7531","As a music player... The sound quality is average. The bass is lost in most cases. If you just want a Bluetooth speaker, look elsewhere.","Positive"
"7532","The Alexa App needs to have a better search engine behind it. It's fine for shopping but for most questions, Alexa has no answer, defaulting to ""I don't uanderstand"" or something in that manner. Ask Alexa ""how long does it take sunlight to reach earth"" and she can't find an answer. I can query Google's assistant (OK Google) with the same question and I get the correct response. Even Microsoft's Cortana can give me the correct answer.","Positive"
"7533","Could you imagine if just these 3 tech giants can learn to play nice and build a single home automation and Assistant AI? It would be EPIC!!! Till then, 3 stats for trying.","Positive"
"7534","I've had this Amazon echo for about a month now and I absolutely love it. I found it to be pretty convienient in my living room to use it when I'm just sitting on the couch or if I'm in the kitchen needing a timer or if I can't remember certain measurements for cooking overall I like it and it's a great product so far. I haven't run into any problems with it!","Positive"
"7535","Got it for the wife for Christmas. She absolutely LOVES it, she probably now wonders how she ever lived without it :-)","Positive"
"7536","Yes nice device","Positive"
"7537","Other than Alexa sometimes responding to my TV, this is perfect. Love the connectivity.","Positive"
"7538","She even laughs when she says ""Alexa... Insult me"" and Alexa rips off  a good one.","Positive"
"7539","I personally have tried allt he Star Trek lines...(Tea Earl Grey Hot)","Positive"
"7540","And Ill admit, during Football Sundays, its nice to ask ""Alexa... Sports Update"" to hear the Steelers current score (they dont show their games on TV much here in Austin).","Positive"
"7541","And I am also having fun now that I have rigged up a Raspberry Pi2 to my X-10 system (google ""Alexa X-10"" and find the UPDATED version of the guy's writeup with habridge to follow step by step instructions), and controlling lights and stuff just by asking Alexa to turn on/off things (the kids will be getting lazy, now that Alexa can do it, they wont have to! :-) )","Positive"
"7542","Really like the echo and refurb was a great buy. I would buy it again!","Positive"
"7543","We love Alexa!!! Our kids get to play their music and we all have fun with Alexa! This was for sure our best Christmas gift!","Positive"
"7544","Wonderfull product. Alexa has integrated herself into our everyday life. Everyth me we enter the house we ask her to turn on all lights and sometimes preheat the oven. She is great for music. The sound is projected clearly and fully throughout the living room and kitchen. She is great for making shopping list and the app keeps it handy at the store. When we are in bed we can lock up the house and turn all the lights down or out with minimal effort.","Positive"
"7545","I bought this as a gift for my wife and she loves it. She uses it for weather updates, music and various questions that the kids have. My daughter likes Alexa to tell jokes and the Simon says feature. For some reason this device just doesn't work with my voice. I have to repeat myself 5 times and usually get a response to some different question. If I ask for the weather in New York I get the weather for New Mexico. I don't have any type of accent or speech impediment for reference. My wife and kids don't seem to have the same problem so I guess it's just me but I have no idea why. My wife was so happy with it that she wanted the Echo Dot for a different room. I'm glad that everyone else likes the Echo and is able to get a lot of use out of it but Alexa and I just don't get along.","Positive"
"7546","Love love love this","Positive"
"7547","I'm using this as my entire sound solution in my small home. Love it! It bluetooths from my devices and keeps the space filled with music and great audio. In my opinion, it looks a little nicer than the Google Home also.","Positive"
"7548","We got this as a gift and we absolutely love it. I love the shopping list feature-I tell Alexa what to add to me list and I can pull it up while shopping. I tell her good morning and she will give me a small history lesson on what happened that day x amount years ago. My 14 month old son will dance when he sees it because we play music through it all the time. We highly recommend getting one.","Positive"
"7549","I love my echo...I use it mostly for listening to music; my kids love asking questions and sometimes silly one and he does come up with appropriate answer...I wish I bought it earlier when it first came out.","Positive"
"7550","This transaction went smoothly and I love the product.","Positive"
"7551","I bought the white Amazon Echo to match your Decor better. We had the black Amazon Echo before and just upgraded to the white color. Very happy with it. We also have two Echo dots up stairs and different rooms.","Positive"
"7552","Setup - comparing this with Google Home - it took more steps and somewhat confusing - I'm using a comparative review since I have both items","Negative"
"7553","Sound - Echo sounds a little light on the base - Google Home was better but that's just me","Positive"
"7554","Commands - other people probably have tried this but Echo will not say any other name.  If you say ""Alexa, say I Love You, Mary"" it interprets it as a question.  if you say Alexa, say I love You without any name it says it.  Google Home is worse - it won't even say the phrase 'I Love You'.","Positive"
"7555","I like the way it looks more than Google Home - Google Home looks like an air freshener","Positive"
"7556","Great product.  Don't know how I survived life without Alexa.","Positive"
"7557","Music - I like Echo better since I have Amazon Prime so it's more versatile than Google Home - I had Google Home on Pandora","Positive"
"7558","Trivia - about equal - actually had fun just asking random questions","Positive"
"7559","For Both - Integrated battery should be part of the package - I had buy one for Echo.","Positive"
"7560","I received the Amazon Alexa for Christmas, and I thought, ""What am I going to do with this, it's just another speaker?!"" But when I actually tried it, got the Alexa app and saw all the things it could do, well, I LOVE it! Every family needs one of these. Alexa is our household companion and can understand you SO clearly, and answer all your questions. (She's a thousand times better than Siri!!) Whether it's homework, cooking, or simply day-to-day stuff she's got it all. ""How many ounces in 3.5 cups? What's the square root of the circumference of the Earth? Play relaxing music. Where is the nearest hair salon?"" These are only a few of the questions she can answer. But it's not just questions, you can enable things on the free app so that she can meow, give you tips, tell you the weather, play music, tell you jokes, put stuff on your shopping list, or even play rock-paper-scissors with you. Plus, every week new technology & questions are added. Alexa is just beyond incredible, and is something everyone should have in their home.","Positive"
"7561","Love it!  Plays music all the time...tells me the weather...etc.  Love it","Positive"
"7562","what it there to say? I love this my new friend.","Positive"
"7563","Very sad. I enjoyed my echo alot at first but then it stopped working for no reason. I had only had it for 4 months.","Negative"
"7564","I was one of those first people that had to have this the minute I saw the first teaser ad and as soon as it was available I picked one up for our home and as gifts for family members.","Positive"
"7565","Don't get me wrong it's a very neat product but the searches are extremely limited and every time I would ask to hear some music over 90% of the time I would get ""here's a sample"" of an artist and that would be it.","Positive"
"7566","Finally broke down and ordered a Google Home and have to say it's simply a better product. It's cleaner integration into Nest, I can tell it to play music on speakers in any room in the house and the kicker: If it doesn't have a selected song in Google Play you can ask it to play the song via YouTube which now expands the musical selections greatly.","Positive"
"7567","Works very well, thought I could use it as PC speaker, not so. Support is very good and was told there R&D staff are taking notes , for upgrades.","Positive"
"7568","I LOVE my Echo.  I gave it a 4 though so people will notice that it doesn't work with iTunes - you can't ask it to play songs from your iTunes library.  I'm guessing that's an issue on the Apple side but still disappointing.  I do use Spotify for music I buy and it does work with Spotify which is great.  The speaker quality is great for the size of this!  I haven't even figured out all it can do - but out of the box it's easy to get working and playing music and answering questions,  telling jokes.....  A great ""toy""  which is a very useful device","Positive"
"7569","alexa doesn't seem to be able to give temperature readings, traffic info or where stores and restaurants are located near our location.  Your system apparently thinks we are in Northern California instead of La Canada and apparently we cannot change this miss information, therefore Alexa is less useful and would recommend it only for simple needs.","Positive"
"7570","The sound quality for the music is amazing! It just fills up the space with sound. I use it a lot when I am cooking - it's my new timer. Great for news headlines, sport scores, and weather. I have absolutely no regrets buying Echo. Actually thinking I may get another one in the future.","Positive"
"7571","Wonderful gift I gave for Christmas.","Positive"
"7572","First time I've  had an argument with a semi retard gadget...","Negative"
"7573","I'm just left annoyed","Negative"
"7574","so i bought the other bitch...","Negative"
"7575","Yep miss google doesn't mind sharing....","Negative"
"7576","great thanks just purchase the battery.","Positive"
"7577","Exceeds expectations!  Several friends who visited our home have since ordered it. The quality of sound is amazing, given its small size.  This was a perfect Christmas gift for a ""nerdy"" person like myself.","Positive"
"7578","Girlfriend likes it a lot. Amazon music is a must to ask alexa to play anything and have her comply. requires specific question syntax sometimes or else she doesnt know what youre talking about.","Positive"
"7579","We love the echo! I never know what to get my husband and he was very surprised and loves using it.It's easy to set up and fun to use.  Love it for music, jeopardy, silly questions and the many apps available.","Positive"
"7580","After receiving the echo I got it all hooked up and started using it right away. It seemed fine but shortly into using it within hours I noticed it wasn't doing as asked. Music would play for a short moment then stop. It wouldn't answer questions. I wrote on the wall that was available for questions and spoke to friends who have it. I was told to do a variety of steps and also was told if your Wi-Fi is not strong you will have issues. We are in a country setting and Wi-Fi isn't as great as it could be sometimes so I decided to return it. I was not sure what to do and didn't want to have troubles all the time like that. It was just too expensive to take a chance.","Positive"
"7581","Love this Echo.  Tells me the weather, news and play's my music.","Positive"
"7582","Very useful and fun. Love it!  Has much better sound than the Echo Dots that I got from QVC, but they're great too. Very easy to use without having to read a manual. Very intuitive like an Apple iPhone and iPad are. Plug it in, add the app, connect once and start using it. It really is that easy!","Positive"
"7583","Works well still learning how to use it.","Positive"
"7584","My husband and I gave each other the Echo for Christmas. It is so much fun and amazing! I think the grandkids are enjoying it as much as us, but I am afraid she'll blow a fuse with their constant questions and demands. LOL","Positive"
"7585","Love the echo. We've had a great time with it and grandkids loved it at Christmas.","Positive"
"7586","I love this speaker, was it worth the high price?, Yes it should of cost a lot more. High quality and Great design.","Positive"
"7587","Arrived a day early, easy set up, works great, love it.","Positive"
"7588","Awesome!!","Positive"
"7589","Love love love it","Positive"
"7590","Did not care for echo, felt like it is a super expensive bluetooth speaker.  Did not feel that Alexa is very user friendly.  I returned.","Positive"
"7591","My wife really love.","Positive"
"7592","My brother bought this for me to help make life a little easier in some simple ways. The shopping list is awesome. For 6-8 weeks my unit worked beautifully. Played music every time I asked. Did everything I asked. Then, it stopped playing music altogether. I called. Customer serviced called right back many many times each time saying it was something wrong with the wifi at home or the operator. When I suggested exchanging the unit the idea was dismissed. ""The team is still working on your issue"" Then ""the team"" suggests exchanging unit but I have to call. So I call. Now I need all the private info about the giver of the gift- which wouldn't be such an issue except my brother is deployed across the world and 5 time zones. Would not recommend this product nor the customer service. That being said, those I spoke to were always kind, polite, and easy to understand. That is certainly appreciated. However, the fixing of the problem saga continues....... UGH!","Positive"
"7593","There are already of ton of incredibly lengthy reviews for this device, so I'll keep it short and sweet.","Negative"
"7594","This device works flawlessly and has incredible sound for the size and price. I use it with the Echo only Amazon Music Unlimited service. The price of $3.99/mo for Amazon's entire music library is an incredible value. Back to the device: it is well built and feels sturdy enough. I have it mounted with an aftermarket wall mount and the 360 driver still fills the room with sound.","Positive"
"7595","Alexa works incredibly well. Even better than Cortana, which is light years ahead of Siri. She understands just about every command I give and can hear in just about any situation.","Positive"
"7596","Conclusion: If you're shopping for an Echo, just stop thinking about it and get it. You won't be disappointed, unless you're the type of person who hates puppies, then there's no hope for you.","Negative"
"7597","Very limited, in my opinion.  The Alexa app has serious problems loading.  Very frustrating.","Negative"
"7598","BEST INVENTION EVER.  WHICH THE VOICE SEARCH WAS BETTER AND THAT MULTIPLE DEVICES COULD TALK TO EACH OTHER LIKE AN INTERCOM.","Positive"
"7599","Operates better than I anticipated. Useful and fun to have in the house.","Positive"
"7600","This thing is insanely cool. I bought it for my parents for Christmas. My dad loves it and my mom wants to kill me. He keeps requesting a song just to see if it can find it. She says he is worse with the Echo than he is changing channels on the TV. I also got a wall outlet and wall switch to go with it. The outlet works great with a lamp. They haven't installed the wall switch yet.","Positive"
"7601","I love it. Purchase more for xmas gifts. and everyone loves it.","Positive"
"7602","Luv Alexa but need to do more research on how to better utilize it.","Positive"
"7603","This is so awesome","Positive"
"7604","I LOVE my new Echo:)!!!","Positive"
"7605","Who knew how much we'd love Alexa? My only complaint is how much my kids ALSO love Alexa... ;-) I think if Alexa could speak her mind, she may have a similar complaint! Let's hope she can never speak her mind, or my kids better watch out, eh?","Positive"
"7606","I got Alexander for Christmas,was very excited.I am disappointed in her.She does well with music,games,weather,however when I as for information ,she tells me she can't find the answer.I did the voice training.She still does not understand me.She uses Wikipedia, not Google search engine.Alexander uses Bing search engine,again she has a hard time understanding commands.I was going to get my grandchildren one,but after my experience with Echo,they will be getting Google Home.A friend has one ,much better with commands and getting information.","Positive"
"7607","Love it!!","Positive"
"7608","Don't waste your money on this, just buy a good Bluetooth speaker.  I have had my Echo for about three months.  It can only answer questions if you enable the appropriate skills to do so, then you have to remember the command for each skill in order for it to respond.  Although it is not a bad speaker, it has a very low success rate of opening and playing music when I ask it too.  It also has a tendency of just stopping in the middle of a song and I can't get it to work again without unplugging it and plugging back in.","Positive"
"7609","My husband gave me an Amazon Echo for Christmas nine days ago. It will not connect to our wifi. I'm a very computer-savvy person, but every trouble-shooting step suggested by Amazon has failed. Once or twice ""Alexa"" has actually announced that she's connected, but then disconnects or says she cannot understand me and to try later. I called Echo support, and spoke to someone whose English was barely intelligible (I'm also a language teacher and am very experienced and patient with non-native English speakers.) The Alexa app on my iPad freezes on the Intro Video page. Everything about my Echo experience has been a nightmare; I'm ready to ship it back.","Positive"
"7610","I got the Echo for Christmas, and had to return it.  Initial set-up was bumpy with a snag during the connection to wi-fi, but I got past that.  The Echo worked well for about 1 day.  The next day, it was non-responsive.  According to the Alexa app, it was off-line for some reason.  So, I followed Amazon online technical instructions to trouble-shoot, which ran the gamut from powering off Echo, resetting Echo, to resetting my home wi-fi.  I Googled this error and found that it was apparently quite common.  What a shame that a device that's supposed to be smart and make our lives better and easier should be this complicated to set up and stay functional!  Amazon should take a hard and critical look at this product and consider withholding sales of this product until the technology is perfected and the kinks are ironed on. Connecting to wi-fi should be a very simple and basic things.  All my other ""un-smart"" devices had no problems getting connected and staying connected.  I'm extremely disappointed.  After wasting a few hours on this, I decided that this wasn't worth it and returned the product.  One more thing to consider is that I make a living with business-intelligence software development and I'm generally very tech savvy.  If a software engineer can't make this device work, what chances have the non-technical masses?  Again, deep disappointment with a product that has great potential but was poorly engineered and tested.","Positive"
"7611","I gave one and gave one to my nephew who loves it. He uses it for music. Only issue with the nephew... there's so much more he can use it for!!","Negative"
"7612","Love it  Need need to learn more of what can be done with it","Positive"
"7613","Still learning everything it can do.  Does not know answers a little more often than I would expect.","Positive"
"7614","VERY COOL!  I'm so glad I purchased this.  I'm connecting more and more household things every day.  A lot of fun and plenty to learn to get the most out of this.  I suggest a book when you purchase this.","Positive"
"7615","Great product. LOVE it. Alexa was easy to set up - practically plug and go.  You do need to go online and get the skills available. (Skills are like apps.)  She is quite interesting to ""talk to.""  She recognizes speech patterns and plays songs, turns on and off the lights (providing you've bought the Wemo plug.)  First thing daily she tells you the weather, news, turns on the lights. She can make coffee if you have the plug - another purchase.)  She will play music through home stereo system.  With Amazon Prime you get 250,000 songs or genres to play.","Positive"
"7616","Programmers have done an initially good job but many improvements needed and many more apps (or skills) needed. On Jan. 3 she kept playing Christmas songs when I told her ""easy songs."" We purchased the Echo for the main part of the house and a Dot for the bedroom. DOT is not as good a speaker system as the Echo. Also they need different names or both start talking at the same time.  Consumers need the option of naming them what we want instead of ""Amazon"" ""Echo"" or ""Alexa"" which is way too limiting.","Positive"
"7617","She reads and tells me what's on my Google calendar which is excellent. But you must command her ""Alexa what's on my calendar today... or tomorrow, etc.""  Would like her to tell me so and so has a birthday next week or next month and then go ahead with ordering something for them.","Positive"
"7618","Even Tunein Radio which is a built ""skill"".  for instance, when I ask Alexa to open Tunein radio, she says that that skill is not enabled.  Or when I ask her to open Pandora, she says OK here is the last station played, then silence, no music.","Positive"
"7619","Echo finds great info but you have to tell ""her"" to go to Wikipedia.  Also she can operate two accounts on Amazon Prime and switch easily between them.  She tracks packages bought which is also helpful. She can find you recipes when you're cooking.  And responds well to voice commands - a bit better than Dot which needed to be reset twice.","Positive"
"7620","Amazon has contracted with over 1,000 vendors to get more apps available so this will be a fantastic home tool when those apps become available in 2017-18.","Positive"
"7621","All in all - I LOVE this product.  It's the best Amazon product since the Kindle.","Positive"
"7622","Works really well","Positive"
"7623","Works very well.  I bought this for my parents for Christmas.  They have been using for about 3 or 4 days now.  I think this is really going to help my Dad (who has Parkinsons) enunciate his words as Alexa has some difficulty with his requests.","Positive"
"7624","The speaker on the refurbished Echo sounds as if it is blown.  It has a fuzzy, static sound.  The Echos my friends and family have do not sound like mine, their Echos are clear and sharp.  Also, anyone that purchases an Echo should be advised that they must have Amazon Prime to get the best free music.  The minute I canceled my Prime membership, I could not receive any music stations from the Echo.","Positive"
"7625","Absolutely awesome!!!","Positive"
"7626","Since google decided to launch a similar product this year I had to get all my family members on the winning team before they made a poorly informed decisions. My mother in law's 2 year old would enjoy it more if the echo would sing Let It Go along with her since she already renamed her new best friend Elsa. That is all.","Positive"
"7627","love it","Positive"
"7628","It also lacks the ability to self-diagnose problems and always refers you to the Alexa App.","Negative"
"7629","Love it, such fun and every day I find another use for it.....surprised at how good the speaker is.","Positive"
"7630","Love the Echo. Gets better each time you use it. Would love as many skills ad people can anticipate. Music sounds great on it.","Positive"
"7631","I cannot tell you how much I love the Echo. It not only is a wealth of information, but has the most amazing sound. I have a BOSE cd/radio and I would put the echo up against it as equal.","Positive"
"7632","Love, Love Love it!!!!","Positive"
"7633","Amazing","Positive"
"7634","If you have a Dot, and typically say ""Alexa, turn volume to 10"" on it when listening to music, do not, and I repeat, DO NOT do that with this Echo.  I owned a Dot for about a week before I ordered a full sized Alexa for the downstairs.  I grew way too comfortable with the Dot's single speaker, which is on the bottom of the device.  So I got this full blown Echo, and told her to turn up to 10.  The room flooded with noise... I could hardly hear myself think as I shouted ""Alexa, stop!""  She didn't hear me the first 3 times as I walked closer, and I started to panic when I saw there were no volume buttons on the top like there are with the Dot (the top part of this Echo is a knob for volume, but I didn't know that at the time, because let's face it... who really reads the instructions on a device like this).  I finally got close enough for her to hear me telling her to shut her face (I was about 2' away at that point), and silence ensued.","Positive"
"7635","But seriously, I use her for a ton of things, like turning lights on and off and adding events to my calendar, creating shopping lists, and the general asking of questions and playing of the music.  This thing is the tits.","Positive"
"7636","We own 4 full-size Echos.  That statement in itself is probably an adequate review.","Positive"
"7637","At this point, it is all hype.  Wait a couple of years until they get this AI to a better place.  Right now its not worth the price.","Positive"
"7638","Super fun to use.  Can't wait to add on things like light bulbs and such to use with Alexa.","Positive"
"7639","Alexa is awesome. Still getting used to all of the cool features, but that's what makes it fun.","Positive"
"7640","Love it","Positive"
"7641","We like our new Amazon Echo. Sounds great when playing music!","Positive"
"7642","I love my new Echo. It tells me the time, weather, and other facts. I ask it to play my favorite music and I can listen for hours.","Positive"
"7643","Can I just say: WOW. I've been curious about this device for a long time now, and I finally got one for Christmas. The Echo is just amazing. Capable of playing Amazon Music AND Spotify (on some pretty excellent speakers, I might add), giving you daily weather and news updates, adding items to your shopping or to-do list, and of course answering nearly any fact-based question, this device provides HOURS of entertainment. The ""skills"" library is also pretty neat; you can enable your Echo to do very specific tasks or play games with you. Lots of possibilities there. Beyond all the bells and whistles, the sensitivity and functionality of the Echo is unbelievable. It can hear me say the wake word from literally ANY room in my house, no matter the distance, and it can differentiate between me saying, ""Alexa"" trying get its attention and just saying ""Alexa"" in the middle of a sentence, which is to say that it can read your tone so well that it doesn't activate when saying the wake word simply in passing. I am usually so frustrated with these voice command devices, because they never seem to hear what I'm saying correctly. NOT so with the Echo; Alexa hears me accurately nearly every time, no matter how complex my command or question is. The way this thing picks up sound is just incredible. Never seen anything like it. After just a few days, this product has become such a fixture in our living room that we have started talking about Alexa like she's a person! I'm definitely going to try out the Echo Dot for my bedroom, just so I can have the mini version separately. Really excellent; I simply can't rate this product highly enough.","Positive"
"7644","It doesn't have or know a lot of things that we ask for. Many questions are not known.","Positive"
"7645","This is wonderful. We are having so much fun with it.","Positive"
"7646","so happy with this purchase.","Positive"
"7647","My Husband loves it!","Positive"
"7648","We absolutely love this device.  We are prime members so can listen to amazon's music for free.  It's great to be","Positive"
"7649","Absolutely love our Echo. Setup was super easy. Functionality is fantastic.","Positive"
"7650","I was so happy to get them, my daughter and grand daughter were so exited to receive as an Christmas present and they are really having a great time with it.","Positive"
"7651","If you ask her easy questions she will get them every time. But I haven't had much luck getting her to search the internet for information. The ads also are a little misleading about asking her to play a song. She will only play a specific song if its old enough to be on prime music for free or if you had paid for a music subscription. She will play stations from pandora, but that doesn't guarantee a certain song. Also.... if she is on volume 10, then you have to get really close to get her to hear you to turn her down.","Positive"
"7652","My mom's new best friend.  LAWD","Positive"
"7653","Love the sound of the speaker","Positive"
"7654","great I am loving it thank you","Positive"
"7655","Fun so far.  I still have a lot to learn.","Positive"
"7656","Right now having fun with it","Positive"
"7657","able to request a genre of songs or songs by a group by simply asking Alexa!  Have bought 4 echoes and will buy","Positive"
"7658","All I can say is, fun and very useful. You got to get one, or more, like I did.","Positive"
"7659","Love love love LOVE my Echo (Alexa)!!!  A friend of mine had gotten this a few months ago and whenever I was at their house I had a ball playing music, asking questions, turning lights on and off!  Didn't realize there was so much more to what she can do.  I manage my shopping and to do lists which is amazing not to have to stop and grab a pen and paper every time something pops into my head, like when I'm sitting on the couch or in the middle of cooking dinner and my hands are all mucked up and I know I need more paper towels!  I just tell Alexa to add to my shopping list and voila. Also, I've connected to Pandora and Spotify which is amazing to just ask her to play a playlist or specific song or album and never have to touch anything to do so.  The quality of the speaker is pretty good too, can easily fill a room on a low setting - you're not going to get subwoofer quality sound but it's still very good quality! I look forward to future enhancements to this product and am very happy about this purchase!","Positive"
"7660","Wow! Alexa has managed to exceed all of my expectations! Not only has she answered every odd question I've asked her, but her sound quality is amazing!","Positive"
"7661","We tested her ""skills"" with our smart lights and our ecobee.. she flawlessly completed each task every time.","Positive"
"7662","We have played games with her (20 questions, magic door, etc) and my 6 year old is absolutely loving it.","Positive"
"7663","We have played music, asked about the weather, the news, our favorite sports teams, etc... and she has responded accurately each and every time.","Positive"
"7664","I would absolutely recommend getting an Alexa of your very own! Not only has she made our lives easier but she's also a lot of fun and quite entertaining!","Positive"
"7665","First off this is a great technology that I have really enjoyed.  Sometimes she cant hear me and I have to say Alexa pretty loud.  There are a lot of questions she doesnt know so you just have to use her for what she is good at and you will appreciate Echo.  I love having her for music and radio for sure.  My wife has really taken her over though and uses her more than I do!","Positive"
"7666","Two of my sons got me this Echo for my birthday.  I know there are many more things I can ask Alexa but so far, it has worked great.","Positive"
"7667","Much smaller than I had expected, but still great sound and functionality. Great function and design. Still learning about it, but seems great thus far (after a day!).","Positive"
"7668","more as gifts when the price lowers as it did prior to last holiday season.  Sound quality is excellent for such a small","Positive"
"7669","My new favorite thing!!","Positive"
"7670","Love it!","Positive"
"7671","The Echo is good, we are still figuring it out but making headway.  Our grandkids sure have fun with asking Alexa questions or for jokes.","Positive"
"7672","Unfortunately, there was a small bit of damage to the Echo caused from not enough packaging around it.  It was only cosmetic so we did not report it but you might want to pack these a little better.","Positive"
"7673","These are just plain awesome. Sound quality is very good for all kinds of different music and pairing with bluetooth is very easy","Positive"
"7674","love this for playing music.  But a little disappointed that Alexia does not know the answer to a lot of questions.","Positive"
"7675","Everything it was cracked up to be!","Negative"
"7676","Easy to hook up. But the intelligence base is limited; somewhat disappointing. Not so easy to link to an amp so you can play through wall speakers. More of a toy than a working device at this point. Hopefully Amazon makes improvements so it is more useful in the future.","Positive"
"7677","Nice to have someone to talk to.","Positive"
"7678","I can't even describe how much we love our Echo! I was hesitant to take a step to go ""smart"" in the house, so we started with this echo, then graduated to Nest thermostats, had to get a couple dots, and I couldn't rave enough about how convenient it is to add things to my shopping list or to do list, or listen to music while my hands are too busy to use my phone, etc.","Positive"
"7679","Decided to try the Echo and now I'm hooked.  Works far better than I expected, and I now use it to control almost all my home automation- adjusting my Nest thermostat, and controlling my Lutron Casetta dimmer switches via my Wink hub.  Run 'robots' with it as well- I tell Alexa to turn on 'Good morning' and several sets of lights turn on at whatever dimmer setting I choose, and the TV and coffee pot turn on.","Positive"
"7680","I love my Wink as well.  I have geolocation set to turn all my lights off and turn my thermostat down when I leave the house, and to reverse the process when I return.  Helps me to effortlessly save energy and come home to a house that's we'll lit before I even come in the door.","Positive"
"7681","When I read reviews that say this is the best and most accurate voice recognition, I really have to wonder if they only own Apple products (or are paid reviewers).  After receiving the Echo for my birthday I've been comparing it Cortana on my computer and Google Now, and honestly, the most accurate voice recognition is probably Google (despite the fact the I almost never used it before receiving the Echo).","Positive"
"7682","Is this a bad product? No. Not by any means.","Negative"
"7683","Is it worth five stars? No.  Unless you only use Siri as a comparison, maybe.  I've heard some horror stories.  People that only eat hamburger will look at roast beef like it's steak.","Positive"
"7684","For the most part it is accurate, but it's functionality is limited to an on/off switch, questionable remote control functions if you have the patience with Harmony, reminders/appointments/alarms (that both Android and Microsoft do just as well), random questions that it can sometimes answer (both Cortana and Google answered questions better), news, podcast, music, and skills which can of questionable benefit.","Positive"
"7685","Where it excels and falls short is music.","Negative"
"7686","For users that want to play their own libraries, the short answer is it's bad.  The free option is the smallest amount of storage among all the major players (250 songs), and it's not possible to sync playlist.  It might have some hidden option to sync iTunes playlist, but as far as I know MediaMonkey users have no options to import m3u playlist or read the database file.  You want playlist, it's a tedious manual job.  You can do it by folder, but that's about it.  To listen to your own music, you can fork over another ~25 a year if you have more than 250 songs.  You might be better off purging your library periodically and limiting yourself to a favorite playlist.  To put it bluntly, Alexa's recognition of songs in the library is bad.  It will tell you that you don't have songs that you uploaded.  You'll have to use the mobile app, making Alexa about as useful as $60 Bluetooth speaker.","Positive"
"7687","Awesome!","Positive"
"7688","Amazon Prime Music is hit or miss, and when it misses, it misses hard.  I asked Alex to play ""Stairway to Heaven"" and when it did, it played Stairway to Heaven by Rockabye Baby.  I immediately shouted at Alexa, ""stop the ABOMINATION!""  Alexa ignored me.  I then said, ""Alexa stop this [explitive] right now.""  Which it finally did.  I then asked to specifically play the Led Zeppelin version, and it couldn't.","Negative"
"7689","Amazon Unlimited, once you get past the autotuned nonsense that it initially recommends, is actually pretty good.  That stations and algorithms seems to work pretty well, and the bit rate seems like it is fairly high.  No noticeable distortion that you'd hear with lower bitrates, especially with guitars and cymbals and the like.  Audiophiles will have their own opinions on this one.","Positive"
"7690","It's hard to rate a product own it's own without rating the services it's locked into.  I'd like to see Groove Music, Google Music, Slacker and Sirius XM added, especially since the first two offer significantly more storage than Amazon, without nickel and diming. Also, the fist two have no restrictions to allowing Amazon into their platform (Android and Microsoft).  For audiophiles, I think Groove is the winner, simple because you can encode to the highest bitrate wma, and encode to a lossess format.  So if you're an audiophile with a massive CD collection, or massive FLAC collection from other means (I won't judge), Microsoft is probably the way to go.  I have no idea how good the Xbox One is at playing Lossless WMA and high bitrate WMA files. I'd have a hard time imagining an audiophile even considering streaming their own library, but I guess the X1 would be the way to do it?  Assuming they didn't already have something more sophisticated in place.","Positive"
"7691","So as it stands, I want to give this product more time, but if more apps and functionality aren't added, I would have to say avoid.  If you're an Apple/iPhone user, I'm not sure.  If Siri really is as bad as those horror stories, give it a whirl.  If nothing else, you'll have an awesome radio/personal assistant.  If you're locked into the PC/Android world like I am, you pretty much have everything this product does.  A $10 microphone will get about 90% of the functionality of this device.  Your phone also will have most of functionality of this device. However, the thing is light and somewhat mobile (wish it had a battery), unlike a PC.  My review would instantly bump to 4 stars if I received a $100 gift card and the priced dropped to $90, but at $189 it's just too expensive.","Positive"
"7692","Update: After a little over a month, I'd say the Echo is still not bad (3-3.5 stars).  It won't blow your socks off or anything, but it does have some useful features.  The price does need to come down, but it's still a relatively new product.  Economies/scale and customer demand will eventually drive price to something more reasonable.  I'm toying with getting some lights, to get the benefits of voice control of my smart appliances.  For $20-50 per smart bulb versus <$5 per dumb bulb, it's a tough sell.  As cool as it would be to voice control my lights, I can flick a switch just as easily.  Also, it just doesn't work well with Logitech Harmony (for me anyway).  Even when it does manage to turn on the TV, it's still easier and quicker to grab my phone or remote to control the devices. I think I would've preferred the DOT, as I can hook it into my sound system.  However, it may be better to wait for something with optical audio out from Amazon, Google, or Microsoft.  I use it for the Alarm, Music, and occasional Google Calendar appointment.  I tried to get into the habit of using the timer during cooking, but end up using the stove timer more often.  Just set in my ways.","Positive"
"7693","To be clear, the Echo is user friendly, loaded with Easter-eggs, fairly accurate, and does what it claims.  The things it's lacking on are most likely the result of poorly written apps/skills by other hardware vendors (Logitech).  It's fun to mess around with, but the novelty quickly wears off.  Also, the product is plastic, but appears fairly well made.  This technology should get better as it becomes more common and more players enter the market (Google/Microsoft), and more developers start writing for the device.","Positive"
"7694","I LOVE IT. A+++","Positive"
"7695","So much wasted money. Lame.","Negative"
"7696","This thing is amazing.  So much fun.  It is used by everyone in my family.  Ranging from 8 years old to 77 years old!  She plays music, tells us the weather and even helps my daughter with her homework!  We are constantly finding new things to have her do.  Also works great with automated light switches that I have hooked up to a Wink hub.  LOVE IT!","Positive"
"7697","I love my Echo. I set timers, check sports scores, weather, listen to my favorite jams and tons more just by using my voice. I also have the Wemo outlet to turn lighting on & off with my voice command. I purchased a full size Echo and Echo dot as christmas gifts and they are both loved as much as I love mine. My 5yr old enjoys asking Alexa for jokes and easily turning on his own jams","Positive"
"7698","Its a great speaker for music. But you can find a cheaper speaker that does the same thing. You're supposed to give commands but ""Alexa"" never understands the command.","Positive"
"7699","Geat gift! My daughter loves it.","Positive"
"7700","LOVE IT!","Positive"
"7701","all i can say is wow, can talk to her for hours","Positive"
"7702","Best purchase ever!","Positive"
"7703","So far we are really liking having Alexa as part of our home.  She is helpful, knowledgeable and has a sense of humor.  I have connected several ""smart"" home items to Alexa and for the most part they work.  I have several Lutron Caseta wireless dimmer switches and Alexa controls them all easily.  I also connected to nest thermostats and she is able to quickly adjust room temperatures via our voice commands.  I am struggling a bit with my harmony remote link.  I can tell Alexa to turn on or off the television and she does this well, but I can't seem to get here to change channels or adjust the volume.  I suspect to may be the way I have things set up with my harmony ultimate remote.","Positive"
"7704","We have a prime account and this also allows Alexa to play prime music.  We simply say play ""Olivia by One Direction"", and she starts playing exactly what we asked for.  Additionally we can ask her to play prime music and she will suggest a prime channel and start stream it for us.  The sound is generally pretty good and setting it to the max of 10 is pretty loud.","Positive"
"7705","A couple minor issues have been noted by us so far.  First, if it is playing music at max volume, it was not able to here us screaming Alexa at it.  We had to get up and manually turn the volume down.  Second, it was not able to recognize our Lutron Caseta hub until I moved it closer to the hub location.  Finally, I really wish it had the ability to transmit our via Bluetooth.  This would allow you to stream music to a Bluetooth enabled speaker or receiver for greater flexibility and sound quality.","Positive"
"7706","Overall, we are enjoying our echo and we are glad we finally added this to our smart home.","Positive"
"7707","LOVE IT","Positive"
"7708","Very disappointed., very limited search power does not understand most of the questions......Had it for 3 days not worth the money...","Negative"
"7709","Love it although I wish her name was SUE (in memory of Johnny Cash)","Negative"
"7710","Love it","Positive"
"7711","Love love love!  Just exploring all the capabilities but very excited!  Thought about this for months, finally got it!  Alexa is awesome!","Positive"
"7712","Disappointed in the AMAZON echo, her A.I. is not even close to Google or Siri. She cannot understand simple questions. Approx. 80% of questions I ask she cannot answer and says she doesn't understand. The A.I on this is definitely subpar to others.","Negative"
"7713","So much to learn as Alexa has so many skills. We love it!","Positive"
"7714","My Echo worked well for the first year but now it is dead and I cannot get Amazon to fix it or give me an exchange.  This is one expensive paperweight.","Negative"
"7715","Best music speaker evuh.","Positive"
"7716","Husband loves Alexa and the entire family is having a lot of fun with her.  So far she is easy to use and set up.  Very helpful.","Positive"
"7717","Fun to have in the house","Positive"
"7718","It's better then I expected, love it!!","Positive"
"7719","It is very helpful to my mother who has glaucoma who can't see the stations on the radio now all she has to do is ask Echo for her favorite station thank you Echo","Positive"
"7720","it will not answer unless we push a button! try every thing! very frustrating!","Negative"
"7721","so wanted this to work!","Positive"
"7722","Seemingly a fad gadget that has become part of our daily lives <f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+00BD> jokes and all. Saves time and effort for simple things and saves a web search for something as simple as the weather forecast. Need to time your cooking, Alexa, set a timer. Reorder supplies, update schedules, make a shopping list, control home devices, the list is endless.","Positive"
"7723","Love it.","Positive"
"7724","Very happy","Positive"
"7725","I love it!","Positive"
"7726","Love it so far.  Have it paired with a wemo switch and also with my harmony remote and can pretty much control my tv with Alexa","Positive"
"7727","Love the Echo.  Looking forward to her learning to answer more questions.","Positive"
"7728","We love our Echo! My husband uses it for music and news, and I use it mostly for checking traffic. The speaker is high quality. My only complaint is that it does not have a function to look things up on the internet, which would be very useful. Maybe they will add something like that in the future.","Positive"
"7729","I've been very pleased with the Amazon Echo. It is  blue toothed to my Apple Computer so one less item on the desk.  It plays as requested with decent sound.","Positive"
"7730","absolutely LOVE this product","Positive"
"7731","Gave this to my son for a gift. He is very pleased with it. The clarity is very good and easy to use. Looking forward to purchasing additional items to control lights and thermostat.","Positive"
"7732","We have had so much fun with the Echo. I particularly like just telling Alexa what I need on my shopping list. Also determining facts that we are discussing!","Positive"
"7733","great speakers","Positive"
"7734","My cel phone is almost as good with google","Positive"
"7735","love Alexa","Positive"
"7736","Love it just wish it was a little more intuitive.  Trying to teach it skills.","Positive"
"7737","Loving it  got to learn more about it.","Positive"
"7738","Great product! Best buy!","Positive"
"7739","good","Positive"
"7740","After I purchased our second Echo, Google Home hit the market and I was first in line.  That competing product has so much promise, even given its initially limited functionality, especially in terms of smart home device control support.  I returned it within a week, and that decision had nothing to do with its initially limited functionality.  It was due to sound quality.","Positive"
"7741","We love Alexa!","Positive"
"7742","Great product","Positive"
"7743","I love my Echo!!!","Positive"
"7744","I bought this for my parents but was a little worried about their lack of technological knowledge. After the set up( which I did and was the easiest set up ever) I began to fall in love. As did my parents. My father talks to her like shes the new hit woman on the block. Alexa is nothing like Siri, she is strong and listens to what you are saying, I know longer have to sit and yell into my phone because I now have someone that understands me, Alexa. I have amazon unlimited and Alexa plays me the best music, anything I ever want, and she knows exactly what I like. Best product, I mean family member I have ever..purchased. We love her.","Positive"
"7745","Purchased the amazon echo when it was first introduced to the market. I was looking forward to many years of worry free service but instead, after approximately 2 years of using it, I have realized that it is not worth it. Here are the issues:","Negative"
"7746","a. Connectivity - if you are not using the device for a while, as little as a week, it (mine) needs to be reconnected manually to the wifi every time, and after several times of this, now, it does not even connect at all and refers me to the alexa app help section which makes me re try the connection manually again, which seems like it works, only to disconnect in 2 minutes and the same cycle repeats itself over and over again. Truly frustrating.","Positive"
"7747","b. Bluetooth connectivity is a hit or miss. My phone (galaxy s6) can never find alexa bluetooth connection and always has trouble maintaining the connection for an extended period of time.","Negative"
"7748","c. Use - No one uses echo to ask for the weather, the nearest in and out burger or the year the great wall of china was built, lets face it. We flip out our phones and get a visual image of our questions which is much more worthwhile and tangible to understand, at least that has been my opinion, with regards to alexa being your 'personal' assistant when it comes to things like these.","Positive"
"7749","Bottom line - waste of money !","Negative"
"7750","Works great once you enable the skills.","Positive"
"7751","So unbelievably COOL!!! Best Christmas present - EVER!","Positive"
"7752","I love it my new friend","Positive"
"7753","Amazing AI that gets better with time. Privacy was a concern, but the mute button keeps Alexa sleeping when you don't need assistance.  Just the beginning, AI will be a part of every HH in the next generation. 4 stars vs 5 since there needs further product development-fairly great.  Love the device.","Positive"
"7754","I have a dot and a Echo, I use the echo to turn my lights and my pellet stove on and off, the music is great and the system is easy to hook up and super fast. I love it","Positive"
"7755","Love this!  Alexa has become a member of the family, bad jokes and all.  The hard part was learning how to ask her questions.  Once we figured that out, having her around is great.  We don't have much to connect it to yet, but that's next!","Positive"
"7756","I really like it but still getting used to all the things you can do.  It is a little cumbersome trying to remember the correct phrases for the skills and music. If you don't word it exactly right, it doesn't work but that should resolve itself as I use it more.  Not liking the privacy issues but try to remember to use the mute button whenever we are not using it.  We love the fact that you can say Alexa play my playlist with Amazon prime.  The speakers sound great!","Positive"
"7757","Love it","Positive"
"7758","the whole family loves it","Positive"
"7759","It has been a lot of fun . I am happy/","Positive"
"7760","How one person be so smart?  Alexia knows all!","Positive"
"7761","Love it but at times a question must be asked a few different ways before one gets an answer. It gets used a lot and the music is great. Try asking it to sing a song. Hilarious.","Positive"
"7762","Bought this for my parents.  They talk to her all the time.  Nice!!!","Positive"
"7763","My family has so enjoyed this!!!  Easy to program and once you learn her 'language', she is very popular in our house!  The Grandkids LOVE the music as they ask for their certain songs!!!!  I might have to get a second one for my bedroom to enjoy for myself!!!  LOVE ECHO!","Positive"
"7764","Seriously. I was a bit skeptical when this hit the market place. It took me a year before i bought one. I find something new each day that Alexa can do. The hype was correct. It keeps on learning. She is my new favorite. SORRY SIRI","Positive"
"7765","Wife loved it.","Positive"
"7766","useless","Negative"
"7767","We use Alexia every day. We've even began branching out to more and more smart devices that can be powered by the Echo.","Positive"
"7768","What can I say that hasn't been said before.  THIS IS MY FAVORITE TECH TOY THIS YEAR!  I LOVE IT!!!!!!","Positive"
"7769","Love Alexa!  Great device! Can't wait to discover all the things she can do.","Positive"
"7770","Love it so much we just bought a dot for our bedroom.  So handy!  Love having the shopping list and to do list!  Great for music as well- just name an artist or genre of music.  We have used the calendar and alarms.  Going to get the other products that interface and make my home smarter <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0081>","Positive"
"7771","just love this...it is a great music entertainment accessories","Positive"
"7772","So far really awesome, sounds better than some of the reviews i read gave it.","Positive"
"7773","This was a great gift for my daughter!  The music sounds so good!  We bought the smaller ""dot"" at first but the sound wasn't near as good. It's worth it to pay more, if you can, and get this one with the better speaker!","Positive"
"7774","Just got this for Christmas so learning about all the things it can do. I really appreciate the frequent info coming in about new features.","Positive"
"7775","Love It!","Positive"
"7776","I am currently not using this to it's fullest as I don't yet have much in the way of smart home integration. However, for the simple things that I do use it for, it is just OK. I like that it can easily playback music from various music streaming services and making lists can be helpful as well. However, I find that it can rarely answer questions that I have in regards to pretty much anything. It is nearly always quicker for me to search google for an answer to questions that I come up with throughout the day, and if the Echo does actually provide an answer it is generally inadequate, which again leads me to doing a google search on my smartphone. It does many things, but it does few things very well at this point in time.","Positive"
"7777","It was a Christmas gift and my friend is thrilled","Positive"
"7778","Still learning but I'm liking it a lot","Positive"
"7779","Wonderful product for music lovers.  Lots of fun to play with. Adding the WeMo outlet.","Positive"
"7780","We are having a great deal of fun with it. I can't wait until we start finding out what it can actually do.","Positive"
"7781","I love Alexa but she does have some limitations.  I find slight phrasing can make a big difference in her understanding.  I find myself at times wishing she had Cortana's personality and Ok googles deeply interconnected intelligence. Both Cortana ond Ok google offer a more knowing and intelligent AI.  Although they do read your email and track your location to do that.","Positive"
"7782","She lacks in some basic integrations that should be there.  For instance there is no native support of Outlook 365 or Exchange calendars.  Which is where many people have their work schedules. Every other smart device on the market can do that.  Also, for traffic only one destination or route can be configured.  Integration with something like Waze would be great.","Positive"
"7783","Terrible device, and I only have questions.","Negative"
"7784","As far has the hardware goes I was disappointed to find that the most expensive version in the lineup does not have the ability to connect to Bluetooth receivers, it can only act as one.  That would be ok if the speaker quality was better but as BT a speaker she is about on par with a $49 off brand system found in discount stores. :(  She shines at music playback but the poor sound quality detracts from the experience.  I could opt for the Dot and connect to BT but the build quality just isn't the same.","Negative"
"7785","The Echo is amazing. I got one for my parents as well.","Positive"
"7786","NICE","Positive"
"7787","What can I say about it that has not been said yet? Makes me wonder how I ever lived without it.","Positive"
"7788","Alexa is just amazing.","Positive"
"7789","Great product and well worth the price. The best part is that you don't need to break the bank to get it like any time you look at an Apple product.","Positive"
"7790","Happy about my purchase. It's been a year since I got my Alexa and still works as good as the day I opened the box. <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008B>","Positive"
"7791","We haven't used it to it's fullest potential yet...there are lots of skills we can add yet.  So far it is great for playing music (the speaker is great!), making shopping lists, asking the 'bartender' what is in a drink and finding out the weather!  We are happy with this purchase!","Positive"
"7792","This is an inventive solution that automates many tasks, weather reports, shopping lists, music, and many, many more. We love it!","Positive"
"7793","First, why do you need to scroll through a million ""skills"" to pick which ones your echo should learn? Why doesn't it just do everything? 9/10 times I ask Alexa something it doesn't know the answer, so I pull my phone out and what do you know, Google assistant can give me an answer in no time at all.","Positive"
"7794","I love my alexa....great great item to have.","Positive"
"7795","love it, worked great but now it keeps telling me I need to buy Amazon music, why if I have prime.","Positive"
"7796","Needs more development but off to a great start so far .","Positive"
"7797","Main issue I have is no matter how far down I turn the volume knob it only takes the volume down to about half way, if I want any lower I have to issue voice commands. Getting it to execute the right command has improved over time although amount of times it wakes up falsely has increased. Overall really cool though, have it hooked up to an AnyMote Home device which allows me to control infrared remote devices like TVs etc.","Positive"
"7798","Distortion if turned up to loud on volume...","Negative"
"7799","So far it's Okay.  Yes, our kids and I found Cortana, the other AI to be more fun and more AI Intelligent.  I hope you're listening, Amazon.","Positive"
"7800","This is great for any family and any age. We are a young family who got it for the grandparents. They love it, and now we love it so much, we got one for ourselves. This will be really nice when the kids are older and doing homework. I love the classic echo better than the dot because it has the speaker built in, which makes finding the perfect spot for it so much easier. Alexa understand multiple accents and tones of voice, which is very nice. She will even play audio books for you. I recommend getting the remote as well. If we are in another room and don't want to shout, we can use the remote.","Positive"
"7801","So far I really enjoy my Echo. With music the sound is wonderful. I could be sitting in the other room and still takes my demands.","Positive"
"7802","Absolutely awful. Fun at first but then Alexa undestands nothing. Don't waste you money","Negative"
"7803","Overall the device works well.  The issue I have is with Alexa software.  It does fine giving the news or weather and playing music but any search or question we ask it almost always can never find the answer.  Examples: Who won the Stanley Cup in 2016!!!!!  Does an apple contain Vitamin C? What temperature to cook beef to? Which recording artist won the most Grammy's?  What recording artist sold the most albums?  Simple question and she responded ""Sorry I don't have the answer to that question""  We have asked the questions several different ways to see if she can answer and we get the same response.  These are just a few of the hundred questions we have asked her since Christmas.  I found it is easier to just look the answers up on my phone or the computer.  If they could work out the ""bugs"" and have her answer these simple questions it would be great.  But for now she is just a radio.","Positive"
"7804","Second, why is it so picky about how I ask questions? Is it so hard to differentiate between ""what march madness games are on tonight"" and ""ask march madness what games are on?"" Google search on my phone could do this years ago. Even if Google doesn't know the answer immediately, it's smart enough to read a few sentences from a search.","Negative"
"7805","I expected more. My mind wanders and I have a lot of questions, I got this thinking I won't have to use my phone to google everything and just say things out loud to get my answer, nope. Echo doesn't know most anything! If it does, it's through apps which you have to enable. Example, if you ask Echo how to make deviled eggs, it won't know, to get specific questions, you have to enable apps like AllRecipies and remember to ask Echo specifically in the lines of, ""alexa, search all Allrecipes.com for deviled eggs"", It's just too confusing! If you ask for today's news, you have to enable apps that has news, like ESPN or BBC, but you can only enable one or the other because it'll tell you news of the top enable app on your lists, so if you ask Echo for today's news and you wanted sports news yet BBC news in enabled first on the list, it'll give you BBC news and no sports!!! If I ask a question that's too tough or too much for Echo to answer, it'll say, I pulled up a Bing search link on your Echo App. I DON'T WANT TO USE MY PHONE OR LOOK AT ANYTHING! This suppose to be HANDS FREE! ECHO doesn't know ANYTHING! You have to use very specific word in order for Echo to recognize the responds to enable the specific app, for instance; You tell ""Alexa, tell me a mama joke"", she doesn't understands, then you say ""Alexa start Mama Jokes"", then she'll tell you to enable Yo Mama Jokes app, (which is already enabled) but in order for Echo to tell you yo mama jokes, you have to specifically say what the app want you to say in order for Echo to start using the app by saying ""Alexa, start MOM Jokes (not mama)"" then and only then will Echo start telling you a mama joke! FRUSTRATING!!!!!!!!!! There must be 1000 apps, I do not remember every key phrase to start the questioning!!!!","Positive"
"7806","I should have gotten OK Google. I think they would know more answers to my questions since Google is a search engine. Even Siri from Apple phone answers and know more than Echo.","Positive"
"7807","Awesone. Love it.  I will buy again again and again. Love it","Positive"
"7808","There needs to be an urban version of Echo.  When asked - Alexa did not know information oin any contempary hip hop artists.  But she knew all about Taylor Swift.  Alexa did not know basic stats for LeBron James - the basketball super star.  But she knew about hockey players.  I was excited with the purchase at first but now feel its ""just okay"".  Echo's intelligence needs to be enhanced to reflect a broader population. Wait for the ""intelligence"" to be upgraded.  Right now - she's not soo pretty smart.  Just my two cents.","Positive"
"7809","Love love love","Positive"
"7810","Got this for my family for Christmas. They absolutely love it. It will only get better with time as well if they buy more smart home devices like the Phillips Hue bulbs that I paired with this. You can ask it all kinds of questions and it usually knows the answer. Also it is an amazing for a bluetooth speaker. If you have Amazon Prime it is even better since you can pair it with Amazon's music service and play almost any song you want.","Positive"
"7811","Bought two of these for Christmas gifts our sons are really enjoy them.","Positive"
"7812","Cool beans!! A.I. Is here!!!","Positive"
"7813","It's not as sophisticated as the computer on the Enterprise D, but the Echo is an amazing device.  I was debating whether to get the lower priced Dot, since I read some reviews about the speaker system in the Echo not being that great when playing music at high volumes.  Anyways, I'm glad that I decided on the Echo, since it has pretty good sound quality for it's size.  If I had purchased the Dot, I would have had to invest in good quality bluetooth speaker as well.","Positive"
"7814","Setting up the Echo was also very easy, after I downloaded the app to my iPhone.  I'm still learning all of the what the Echo is capable of performing, since I've only had it since Christmas, but I like the feature that I've been using so far.","Positive"
"7815","Echo may have beat Google to market by over a year but they have a FAR inferior product.","Positive"
"7816","I love Alexa!! So fun to have in the house","Positive"
"7817","Love it","Positive"
"7818","We love the Amazon echo but didn't realize when we purchased it that you really need to have an Amazon prime account so we had to purchase that too. Very easy to setup!!","Positive"
"7819","The Best!","Positive"
"7820","i gave it to my wife as a Christmas present and she uses it all the time.","Positive"
"7821","What a blast. Can't wait to see what Alexa is capable of. The whole family is enjoying it.","Positive"
"7822","LOVE IT","Positive"
"7823","Pretty cool hopefully it'll good morning future","Positive"
"7824","Husbands xmas gift. Loved it. Pretty cool little device.","Positive"
"7825","Im having a great time using my Echo its fun to use and i got it at a great price,  thanks Amazon.","Positive"
"7826","I love it. One problem, when the volume is loud Alexia can't hear you. Otherwise it's great","Negative"
"7827","My husband loved this for his gift this season.","Positive"
"7828","Somewhat confusing in the initial set up, however once that was done, product works well.  Definitely works best when not close to a wall as this seems to impede sound.","Positive"
"7829","I will join the long list of owners who wonder how we ever got by without Alexa. It really is like having an assistant. Shopping list? Equivalents? Mood music? A joke? She's got all the answers.","Positive"
"7830","Alexa doesn't seem to know the answer to many simple questions. There is definitely a learning curve in how to phrase the question to get a meaningful answer. Hopefully she will get smarter with time. Many times questions she can't answer Siri gets on the first try.","Positive"
"7831","Love it! Just wish had volume buttons like the Dot. ;-)","Positive"
"7832","Great product! Sound quality is awesome! Our family is enjoying and discovering new things everyday!","Positive"
"7833","So far we love the Echo! Very helpful, funny and convenient. Our whole family uses it. I love it for the music and timers. My kids love it for the jokes/facts/ weather. My husbands loves to ask it any random question. He talks to Alexa the most.","Positive"
"7834","I absolutely love Alexa. I use the ""Alexa  play whitenoise"" and ""Alexa play sounds from nature"" commands a lot. It puts the kids to sleep quicker than ever. When they are up, we dance to songs by Kids Bop, Katie Perry and other kid friendly artists. We get news from MPR, and a new buzz word each day for the kids to learn. Buzz words is awesome. It tells the kids a new word, defines it, uses it in a sentence and then quizzes them on it. Alexa even tells my kids bedtime stories about them, using their names! There is also a complimenting skill you can add (for free, all skills are free) where she will give you compliments to your hearts content. The volume is great. I think the best part about it is that skills are still being developed for Alexa and all you have to do is ask ""Alexa, what's new?"" and she will tell you about her new features.","Positive"
"7835","It was okay. Two months out of warranty it stopped working. Not going to buy another one. Too expensive for it to last only 2 years at average use.","Negative"
"7836","My two personal favorite skills are Jeopardy and the Magic Door. Everyone knows Jeopardy but Magic Door is an interactive story where you tell Alexa where you want to go and what you want to do and those choices will ultimately alter the story line. Pretty cool especially if you remember those Goosebump books from the 90s.","Positive"
"7837","Okay, now for a little negativity. Sometimes, it is difficult to get her to hear the command ""Alexa"". If the music is too loud she definitely will not hear me. It's not a big deal because I can walk over to the device and press the button and give a command.","Negative"
"7838","All in all, I see myself and my family continuing to use this everyday. Its a great product!","Positive"
"7839","We really enjoyed our Amazon Echo but only had it for one year and it died on us.","Negative"
"7840","The echo sounds good and we love the skills on it. But we bought my mother in law an echo dot for Christmas with a JBL charge 2 speaker. We were going to get another echo but it would not arrive until after Christmas. When we paired the JBL speaker to her echo dot the sound was great. Much better than the sound of the echo speaker.  the sound was fuller and more clear plus she can move her speaker anywhere she is working in the house. The other part is it was $30 cheaper to buy the echo dot and JBL speaker compared to the echo. We are sending the echo back and ordering the echo dot and jbl speaker.","Positive"
"7841","This is still a great product for someone who only wants one thing setting on their counter. good job amazon.","Positive"
"7842","For a senior adult, innovations such as Echo take time getting used to. However, it is fun to use.","Positive"
"7843","this is junk. refurbished was my mistake. it only has weird setups that i can not cancel and of course i cant sent it beck. junk junk junk","Negative"
"7844","This is pretty awesome, great stereo sound for iPhone music and Spotify. My daughter loves it.","Positive"
"7845","Definitely will purchase another one to control lighting and other household needs! Nice price too!","Positive"
"7846","Some people prefer the Google Home's sound quality, but those folks must not crank the volume.  The Google device sounds horrible at louder volumes.  In contrast, the Echo provides room-filling sound.  Of course, it may not please an audiophile, but frankly, what does?  ;)","Negative"
"7847","Not worth the money. Pretty much useless. Ah well.","Positive"
"7848","We love our Amazon Echo!!!","Positive"
"7849","We are really enjoying our Echo - it is so nice to ask Alexa to play music, etc., check movies, etc. We are still learning all of the features, but so far, so good. It arrived in plenty of time for Christmas. It sits on our kitchen counter and really, the speaker sounds great, a good bit of bass sound. I have an iPhone and a Pandora account, for example, so I wanted the Echo to play some of my Pandora music (I have Amazon, too, and Amazon Prime which I HIGHLY suggest getting as it is a good deal), anyway I loaded the Pandora APP to my iPhone first, then Alexa was able to recognize and play my Pandora music. The setup is very easy/simple just plug in and go (you of course need your WiFi).","Positive"
"7850","Wow!","Positive"
"7851","Will not connect to the wifi. Read a lot of complaints about the same issue. I think the would of corrected the issue. They have not.","Negative"
"7852","We really liked this - bought it early on and used it primarily for music, audiobooks, morning news and had just started into new tasks such as ordering pizze and uber.  Unfortunately, it just died shortly after the one-year warranty period ended. That's a shame because we've been exploring wifi speaker systems and we'd like that system to link to our home AI device. I really like the Sonos and Denon systems, but frankly, this bad experience is making me look harder at google home integrations.","Negative"
"7853","Awesome and it came 2 days before stated which worked because it came 1 day before we had Christmas!! Thanks!","Positive"
"7854","Learning about it, but so far very pleased. She can turn on my smart lights, play music and answer my questions.  Tell me if I have anything on my calendar or set up an appointment for me .","Positive"
"7855","Fantastic!","Positive"
"7856","Who doesn't love Alexia?  She is a member of our family who everyone talks to.  Although she's not quite as intelligent as Siri she still has her moments.  We use her mostly for music and timers.  The quality of the speaker is surprisingly good and loud enough.  I also like that as I am throwing away the last of something I can tell her to add it to the shopping list, which in conveniently on my phone when I go to the grocery store.  The only downside to our friend is she is always listening...waiting patiently to hear her name.  It's not too concerning since we are a normal family.  I figured if anyone else was listening they'd quickily turn the channel after the third bout of he's looking at me, she touched me.  You will quickily learn how you have to talk to her so she will understand you.  She does better with short and sweet questions and commands.  She will easily sync with your phone and other devices, but I wasn't able to pair her to Dr. Dre Beatbox.  We have had it over a year now and use it nearly daily and are so satisfied with our purchase we bought our parents each one for Christmas.","Positive"
"7857","We've tossed ours in a box and threw it in the attic. The black device we call alexa cant understand the simplest of commands. Its frustrating to have to say things in such unnatural ways to get an action from here. Seriously, who in the heck wants to say ""Alexa, set the Nest thermostat to 70 degree""? No, its natural to say set the temp to 70 and be done! Complete waste of money!","Negative"
"7858","Love Alexa lol. She's SO handy. Love the tidbits of history she gives every day after she greets you. Plus she's right there with the answer when you need her. I can work on a craft and she will read my book to me, or she plays music, keeps me up on the latest news.","Positive"
"7859","We love it!  We have mostly used it for the music.  The sound is great and the voice recognition works very well.  Highly recommend it for any music lover.","Positive"
"7860","having fun learning all that Alexa can do. so far, mostly music and news/weather, but adding timers for cooking and lists for shopping","Positive"
"7861","Anyone can her anything including my 4yr old. The sound when playing music is outstanding. Quick responses. Bought for my 12yr old for Christmas. He LOVES it. Much better than Siri","Positive"
"7862","At first his was fun, so I decided to upgrade to prime so we could request specific songs to play. 3 days later and I'm considering canceling prime. There's no way to set parental controls on anything so my 13 yr old thinks it's funny to show her friends that this device will do whatever you ask. She plays songs filled with sex, drugs and explicit language when I'm not in the room. Now that I have prime I can't turn off prime music without canceling my prime membership altogether. Also most of the games / skills don't understand what you are saying so they get frustrating. I do like the timer and grocery list features though.","Positive"
"7863","Really great","Positive"
"7864","This is a great device.  I am amazed at the quality of the speakers. It is one of the few genuinely helpful electronic devices in my home.  A quick check of the time and weather and I'm out the door!  Setting timers is super helpful .  My husband loves the news flash briefings from NPR.  I love the music.  Looking forward to exploring all the things that Alex's can do!!","Positive"
"7865","Not very useful, it's novelty wears off quickly.","Positive"
"7866","Born in 1955 .i think of george jetson .wow we've come along way baby. Beginning of a new era .sound is great. thought of adding better speakers before it arrived,no need,volume is also good","Positive"
"7867","Does everything I expected. But I was essentially looking for a combination of a speaker and something close to Siri. If you're looking for it to handle convoluted questions or carry on full conversations...yeah, not the product for you. But it does everything I want it to do. I love the sound quality and the glowing light. It's very helpful with shopping lists.","Positive"
"7868","Just started to use. For some reason it took me over a span of 3 hours to get the hook up through my IPhone with Wifi.","Positive"
"7869","I'm super disappointed it doesn't think Puerto Rico is part of the USA. No movie update, no traffic, no weather - i am so sad.","Negative"
"7870","The instructions are not clear enough to secure this link up . Several times Alexa said we were connected but then disconnected.","Positive"
"7871","We have only just started with the music and it is fantastic for music including the sound.","Positive"
"7872","If at all possible a connect to Wifi through our computer probably would have been easier.","Positive"
"7873","Mainly used for streaming music in the kitchen. Sound quality is very good. Easy volume control by turning top. iOS Alexa App works well. Streaming Apple Music from both iOS and Android works fine. Weather report comes in handy as well as using it as a timer. As Amazon updates the AI and adds features the Echo will become even more useful. WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity work without a hitch.","Positive"
"7874","Gift for my wife, who gets a kick out of it. I use it for commute times, weather, etc. Really nice speaker system for music.","Positive"
"7875","Can't rave enough...skies the limit I'd you buy the plug in for this! No regrets and can't imagine anyone having them. Easy to use with all your music in one spot and one command!","Negative"
"7876","Bought for my wife but also for me. Love this. I wish we would have bought one sooner.  Controls all my lights, fans thermostat. Ask it questions. Still learning","Positive"
"7877","I purchased this for my mother.  She is 73 diabetic and blind.  She lost her vision about 10 years ago due to diabetes.  My mom is really bummed because she loved her PC and would have loved to have a smartphone.  Unfortunately, she only has 5% of her vision left.","Negative"
"7878","MY BLIND MOM ADORES HER AMAZON ECHO!  For her it is a PC that requires NO monitor, mouse or keyboard.  Now she listens to books, music, he daily news briefing, the weather report, puts shopping items on my dad's smartphone, sets alarms, gets business hours of local businesses, plays trivia games, listens to jokes, enables skills on her own and asks Alexa ALL sorts of questions!  She went to a class at Lighthouse for the Blind and was surprised they didn't even mention this device...she tells all her friends about it...and when you are blind, ANYTHING that makes you feel a little more connected to the world is like a godsend! She wishes there was a mobile one she could take with her when she goes out!","Positive"
"7879","Very entertaining and a great sense of security.","Positive"
"7880","Awesome.. get Amazon prime.. enjoy!!","Positive"
"7881","good product!","Positive"
"7882","It came late but my daughter is crazy about it.","Negative"
"7883","I have owned for a week and just live this devise.  Can ask it just about anything and it usually has an answer.  I love the access to music and asking to play any genres and it does an awesome job.  Sound quality is great only wish is that she was wireless so I could move her around with me.  Ordering product Inhave ordered before is also an awesome feature.  Big fan nice job amazon.","Positive"
"7884","These work great can't wait to figure out everything they can do!","Positive"
"7885","Great new item. lives up got the hipe.","Positive"
"7886","The sound that comes out of this black tube is amazing I have thousands of dollars worth of stereo equipment I'm a purist. So I was real stand off on the idea that something like this could produce killer sound for music. The future is here now!!!!","Positive"
"7887","And Alexa is my new best friend.","Positive"
"7888","I did not care for the fact that it put everything I asked on my cell phone.  That made it where I had to continually delete even questions that it misunderstood.  I accidentally ordered this with the full payment and was going to return it and reorder it with the 5 installments.  I will not reorder this.","Negative"
"7889","You have to get Prime and a Fire Tablet","Positive"
"7890","With your music library with your Fire you can play albums and control the volume from your Alexa app, it don't get no better than this","Positive"
"7891","I love Alexa! This was the main thing I wanted for Christmas and I'm so glad I got it! My little boy loves it as well!","Positive"
"7892","Love my Echo for playing music on Spotify and controlling the lights in my home. Sometimes it has issues picking up when I say ""Alexa"" when the music is a bit loud. This is understandable, but can also be a bit frustrating when needing to turn the volume down quickly. Overall, I am very happy with my Amazon Echo.","Positive"
"7893","So far it's been enjoyable.","Positive"
"7894","Love my Echo...use it everyday...","Positive"
"7895","Both the people I bought the echo for love it.","Positive"
"7896","It is new to me, so I haven't yet figured out a lot of things. But the biggest disappointment is that it won't work with Calendar (for mac) which is the calendar on all my devices. If I could use it with my calendar, I would be much more enthusiastic.","Positive"
"7897","Easy to set up and use.  Doesn't know everything....but very satisfied so far.  It is very convenient and can answer a lot of questions.  I can see where it will be very useful as I learn more.","Positive"
"7898","Great looking ! Easy to operate after simple connection to IPad app. . Sound quality rated at 8 out of ten being  highest . My biggest negative was with answered streaming current info as to local weather in my town and then other weather in other states . Shocked at reports of zero degree weather at my home when it was actually 21 degrees and forecasts were also way off . This made me think only of legal actions that could arise from such false reports . Love Jeff B . and Amazon so be ware . New British study compared this unit with Googles new unit and on 10 questions asked Google unit beat out my unit 8.5 to 6 answered correct out of 10 random questions . I love the music use of it and know Jeff B. et al will fix this question streaming problem very soon .","Positive"
"7899","This thing rocks, and once you get to know how to talk to Alexa, it's easy to use.","Positive"
"7900","Timely delivery and product as advertised","Positive"
"7901","On the road a lot and this is tremendous.  Unreal.  I love it.","Positive"
"7902","This was a gift to my son and grandkids.  They are having a lot of fun with it.","Positive"
"7903","We got one for our adul children after we got one for ourselves and loved it. They love it as well.","Positive"
"7904","The wife and kids love it, but it's basically only useful for listening to music. Most searches or questions still aren't understood by Alexa. My android phone with ""Okay Google"" is more useful for searches and other things most of the time.","Positive"
"7905","Bought two as Christmas gifts. My son & his family love it. My daughter & her husband were playing games on it as soon as they got home.Both families love it.","Positive"
"7906","The best!  Buy one NOW! I haven't enjoyed a toy so much in a very long time!!!","Positive"
"7907","I got this for Christmas and I love it. You can ask Alexa anything. She tells jokes also! So much fun!","Positive"
"7908","Had to wait until after Christmas to get it but it wasn't long and worth the wait!","Negative"
"7909","Excellent and very fun!!!","Positive"
"7910","Great item to have in your home.","Positive"
"7911","Love it. Nice addition to our home accesories","Positive"
"7912","The Echo has met all our expectations and more. The sound quality is awesome. I like that it's user friendly. Have recommended to our friends. Use the weather, the calendar, of course the music, and like the alert feature. Thanks for such a great product.","Positive"
"7913","love it","Positive"
"7914","Still learning the device but having fun doing so.","Positive"
"7915","We are turning our home into a smart home and Alexa works perfectly with our other smart home devices!","Positive"
"7916","SO SO AMAZING","Positive"
"7917","Love it!","Positive"
"7918","It's a good start in the right direction but needs more work on voice commands and skills. Works with other smart home devices that are not associated with Amazon.","Positive"
"7919","Loved it","Positive"
"7920","Great. Use it for many things.","Positive"
"7921","Just as seller describedby seller. It is very unique tool however it takes quite awhile to load a custom Playlist unless you want to pay extra for unlimited music 9.99 per month.","Positive"
"7922","Still having issue with getting it set up ???","Negative"
"7923","We had seen this last year at my daughter and son -in-law's house.  We couldn't get over how much information Alexa can supply.  We are now enjoying ours.  Amazing!!","Positive"
"7924","I own both the Echo and Google Home.  The Google is much easier to set and use without spending extra money for Apps, etc.","Positive"
"7925","Fantastic !!!","Positive"
"7926","Excellent devise","Positive"
"7927","Its  A Must Have","Positive"
"7928","I've never hated a gift more in my entire life. I cannot believe people voluntarily put this in their home. I also cannot believe people aren't actively thowing it windows regularly.","Negative"
"7929","If you have children, under no circumstance should you purchase this product. The children and Alexa will have constant conversations, play annoying music, tell annoying jokes, and basically drive you 10X crazier than your kids do already. Save yourself the literal headache and don't buy this or at a minimum wait until the create a feature that ensures Alexa only responds to specific voices.","Negative"
"7930","I can't get this piece of junk out of my house fast enough!!!!!","Positive"
"7931","Awesomeness plays music very well. Finds songs. Turns on and off lights via hue. Checks my security equipment","Positive"
"7932","Love it!","Positive"
"7933","Can not hear over loud noise and can not understand more than one question at the time. Very limited but fun","Negative"
"7934","It it's a fun little device that makes tuning the radio, other music, answer basic questions easy. My 7 year old thinks it's great also! I can't wait to set it up in my kitchen and use it!","Positive"
"7935","The database for facts needs a great many additions.  We were amazed with how little ""she"" knew about various things.  Yet, she is a fun addition to our lives and we are glad that she will learn as time goes on.  After purchase, I was also distressed to learn that this device was going to be used in a court case to review what all it had heard in someone's home.  I did not realize this had become part of the NSA's (or whoever) privacy invasion arsenal.","Positive"
"7936","Very cool device!","Positive"
"7937","Wonderful product.","Positive"
"7938","it's great if you want a speaker for tunes, but even adding 30 aps it would still answer a question with ""I didn't understand the question.  Even as advertised when you ask it what sound does a whale make the answer is ""Splash"".  I didn't want a toy,  It couldn't even say my name or any of the information loaded into the app.","Positive"
"7939","I think it can do just about anything. Speaker quality is great and I love to use it all the time.","Positive"
"7940","We listen to music all the time and this is so easy to listen to our favorite music. Glad we made the purchase.","Positive"
"7941","Awesome","Positive"
"7942","I don't know how we got along without it.  We are still learning all the things that it can do.  Thank you Amazon for creating such a wonderful device.  We love it.","Positive"
"7943","Outstanding","Positive"
"7944","Unfortunately do not have enough power in my Wi-Fi to go through the walls where my Alexa is setting so it doesn't work as good as it should but it is not the fault of the Alexa it is my poor Wi-FI signal.","Negative"
"7945","This product has been one of the best gifts we have purchased for the family in a long time.  We love the music programming, the information, and the fun trivia and other game-like aspects to Alexa.","Positive"
"7946","This is my second echo. Loving them both. It is our timer, clock, radio, sleep machine, shopping list maker, comedian, encyclopedia, etc!","Positive"
"7947","Echo is everything I expected. Love playing music on it and getting answers to plethora of questions.  Easy setup and excellent instructions.","Positive"
"7948","Well made products. Speech recognition is good, but the sound quality of the speaker is bad.","Positive"
"7949","Amazing,","Positive"
"7950","We love the echo","Positive"
"7951","It does everything they say but unfortunately more than I want.  I don't like thinking that she is listening all the time and can sometimes record conversations in the room if she thought we were talking to her.  This needs to be fixed...  Love the  easy music requests though...","Positive"
"7952","these work as described in the advertising.  fun to ask for jokes too","Positive"
"7953","We bought these for Christmas gifts for our Grandchildren. They are having a lot of fun with them. Think their parents like them too.","Positive"
"7954","Since we've returned the Google device, I have purchased two more Echos.  We now have one on each nightstand in our home and another in the kitchen.  We have grown so accustomed to accessing weather, news, and music; setting timers, alarms, and calendar appointments; and controlling our home's smart devices just by speaking that I actually feel a bit lost when I travel on business.","Positive"
"7955","Smarter than my wife","Positive"
"7956","Great tool to have around the house to accomplish things if you hands are full","Positive"
"7957","Great product. Look for sales as this one came in about $40 below list price.","Positive"
"7958","Love it","Positive"
"7959","I really asking Alexa the weather and starting music but sometimes I want other music not available to Alexa like youtube the app could allow adding new sites which would make it better. My wife has a strong Korean accent and it understands her so that part works well.","Positive"
"7960","This was a gift and she is loving using it!","Positive"
"7961","I just LOVE my Echo!  Always there when I call!","Positive"
"7962","Absolutely love it!","Positive"
"7963","Still finding all the things Alexia can do...Amazing and fun product","Positive"
"7964","I have a 2014 Echo that has recently gradually been losing voice command ability.  Intermittent and getting worse. Varies from no response to random responses to a command.  Today, while it was playing, it would not respond at all - I even put my face up to it and yelled ""Alexa"" several times - no response.  I had to use a button to stop it.  While on the phone with tech support - I said ""Alexa"", it turned on and right back off, I could not give it a command.  I won't go on.","Positive"
"7965","This is so cool it sounds great works well.  All I can say is it is just what they say it is.the only fall back would be is what ever you say for it to do is typed out on your Alexa account from word to word. But it does not matter because I love it and you just don't say anything you don't want typed out. Just ask for her to do what she is meant to do","Positive"
"7966","What a fun,entertaining and device!! And what great sound when I play music!!","Positive"
"7967","Great product overall, but I have yet to find a setting that allows me to block explicit content.  I'm just looking for the standard radio version of songs.  When my kids ask Alexa to play music that they have been used to hearing on the Disney Channel like All About That Bass, they get the version with the lines ""you know this sh*t ain't real"" and ""skinny b*tches"".  Really?  I can't block this.  Listeners should be given a choice.  Big problem.  For now, I'm just making them listen to KidzBop.","Positive"
"7968","Very good product... it does what is advertised... happy with it","Positive"
"7969","Coolest device ever! Great sound! Has some awesome features and works well with my Hue Smart Lights! Love it so much!","Positive"
"7970","We love our Echo. So much so that we bought two and added a dot.  The only complaint I have is that I cannot synch the Echos to play the same music at the same time.  Would love for amazon to figure out a way to do this!","Positive"
"7971","Just amazing.","Positive"
"7972","Daughter received this as a gift. She LOVES it!","Positive"
"7973","Amazon doesn't repair any of it's devices.  Period.  Only replacement. I didn't know that until today. After 2 years you're toast.  I'm not happy.  In the past year I have gotten a 2016 Dot 2, a 2017 Tap, a 2015 Kindle Fire HDX - I recently bought Kindles for gifts (Kindle tablets suck).  What a waste.  Never again will I buy any Amazon technology.  Ever.","Positive"
"7974","Can not understand what the big deal is with alexa I bought it about 3 months ago at Lowe's and if she answers 2 out of 10 questions that's a lot just today ask it how to remove perspiration stains from clothing got no answer I asked Google and got the answer and this is with most of the answers alexa can't answer Google answers. I personally don't think it is worth the money and friends that have tried mine are looking more towards Google.","Positive"
"7975","I love the echo. It wonderful to hear my favorite songs and have fun with trivia also get the the weather when I get out of bed. It can not be beat.","Positive"
"7976","great product except be aware of your location. We are in an area here many satellite and electronic items work poorly.","Positive"
"7977","Very nice, love the sound.  Alexa is a wealth of information and fun.","Positive"
"7978","This thing is amazing.","Positive"
"7979","Love her.","Positive"
"7980","My daughter loves her Echo!","Positive"
"7981","love it","Positive"
"7982","great fun! super entertainment! love her!","Positive"
"7983","Fun product! Looking forward to future add on uses.","Positive"
"7984","I have lots of ancient technology that still works.  2009 MacBook I bought last year looks and functions like new.  I have a lot of Apple stuff I got new and used - it's costly, but it lasts, and no matter how you acquired it Apple stands behind everything they sell.  Screw Amazon.","Positive"
"7985","I wish I could give this a 10 star rating because I love it so much, but the truth is Alexia is about as smart as a new puppy!  When I ask for the Trawlerman's Song by Mark Knopfler (I know she can because she plays it on the Shangri-la Album!) she instead plays Troller man by someone I've never heard of. She started one day out by saying ""Today is the day that Roger Staubach threw the ""Hail Mary pass"" and then when I ask her who received that pass (Drew Pearson) she doesn't know!  It can be very frustrating!  She sounds like an adult but she's really a very limited child!  In frustration one day I asked if she was stupid!  She told me she was still learning!  But, do I like Alexia?  Yes!  I love her and I am thrilled to have the service!  It's not perfect and can certainly be frustrating!  It's hard not to think of Alexia as real person!  To quote Sir Paul ""I got to believe it's getting better, getting better all the time!","Positive"
"7986","When it works it is fine  however not much volume. Also temperamental I setting up.  And I had to replace the power chord because it stopped working - Amazon knows it is a flaw and sent replacement but it screwed up my machine.  I don't know that I would buy another  Kind of one of those things that gets forgotten easily.  Get wifi based wireless speakers for real music playing. This is a gadget","Positive"
"7987","Sound is clear and crisp with a nice amount of base.  It is difficult to set up if you do not have a cell phone or tablet. I have only had it in use for about a week.","Positive"
"7988","Having fun with Echo. Got this for a Christmas gift to my Wife. She is Happy. and that makes me Happy. Right","Positive"
"7989","Love Alexa.  Possibilities are endless.","Positive"
"7990","huge device, get the battery base for it.  that includes a usb port for charging your phone, a necessity  if this device takes up the outlet.  very costly way of turning on/off lights, switches are faster, easier, cheaper.  just flip the wall switch.  one of the few ways it pays for itself is making it possible to turn on lights coming into a dark house, and not having to guess where the light switch is.  music is only mono, and no blue tooth.  jokes are less funny as you get farther down the list.  you have to pause after using the wake-up word ""alexa"".  can't just whip out an instruction, it blends with the wake-up word, and alexa won't respond.  not every device you may want to control is available right now.  it might be better to wait until more vendors get involved to make more products that go with this.  it can cost hundreds of dollars to purchase all the needed accessories.","Positive"
"7991","one use that I found is turning on the lights just before, (like seconds before) the alarm goes off.  you go from dreaming to ""what's that?"", then awareness that the alarm clock is next.  it's a more gradual wake-up.","Negative"
"7992","Great for the tech savy but a little challenging for those needing a little more direction.","Positive"
"7993","My daughter is crazed with joy, every day discovering new things to do with Alexa. This is a teenage dream--wake me up, play games with me, play my music. I am excited there can be no more excuses about wake up times, and she is excited to have Alec Baldwin say ""Time to get up, sweetheart""!!!","Positive"
"7994","best product ever - extremely useful. love it","Positive"
"7995","The white blends with her room decor. Box arrived in perfect condition. We are very happy.","Positive"
"7996","I hate this thing!! Period end of Comment! It will not do much of anything but play music and play Jeopardy! Get rid of the stupid APP!! I hate that!! My Echo will play music but heck I could have bought a nice box for the money I spent on this thing!","Negative"
"7997","Let's start with the things I like about the Echo:","Positive"
"7998","I love when I walk into the house with an armload of groceries and without breaking stride say ""Alexa, play 'get stuff done' playlist from Spotify."" and music starts as I walk back to the car for another load. Music not loud enough? ""Alexa, Volume 6"" resume with the groceries. In the morning the flash briefing function is great. The sound quality is excellent as well.","Positive"
"7999","The things I don't like:","Positive"
"8000","Phrasing seems to be important with Alexa. For instance after enabling certain skills Alexa may not recognize them if I ask her to launch a skill with slightly different wording. 2 examples I have come across are ""Alexa, let's play Jeopardy!"" (Alexa tells me skill is not enabled) versus ""Alexa, open Jeopardy!"" (Jeopardy! opens). And also, ""Alexa, open today in history"" (Alexa tells me the skill is not enabled) versus ""Alexa, open this day in history"" (opens skill). Phrasing seems fairly important in other questions too. I asked Alexa a moment ago what 281.66 x 2 is. I phrased it differently until she responded with an answer to the fourth phrase.","Positive"
"8001","Also, if you think Alexa will hear you when you have music at max volume, you are sorely mistaken, but I'm not so disheartened by this, it's not a miracle worker.","Negative"
"8002","The thing I dislike the most:","Negative"
"8003","The power cord! It would be nice if the Echo held a brief charge so that you could move it from room to room (bedroom, to kitchen in the morning) without it shutting down and then restarting. The restart process takes 30 secs or so, but still. A docking system would be cool.. if I had a docking station for it in multiple rooms and didn't have to shut it down when I wanted to change location in the household, well... that would be pretty cool.","Positive"
"8004","Overall, I would recommend the Echo, although a future model might reduce the impact of the cord.","Positive"
"8005","I have to start off saying that I liked the 5-month payment plan and believe it or not I am one of those people that don't have a cell phone which I plan to buy later this year. I did buy the apple iPod touch ( to use for my walking ) and I was able to download the Alexa app on the iPod and connect it to my Wi-Fi it is great I just love it. So if anyone is on the fence about this item do your research ( read reviews etc.)  and buy this because you won't be disappointed. I am still discovering everything the Echo does and in closing, <U+200B>I hope my review helps you in buying this item and if you do have fun with it because I know I do.","Positive"
"8006","I've only had the amazon echo for about 6 days and I love it! The speaker quality is amazing I couldn't believe it. I was never a music person until now, Alexa makes me want to listen to music her speaker is so nice! But overall I love it I call her my girlfriend to joke around, lol! Thanks amazon for a great device!","Positive"
"8007","The only thing i like about this is the sound quality / volume. It's voice recognition is awful. My bathroom is right next to my bedroom in my apartment and it can't even pick up my voice from there or from in my closet. It also infuriates me that it will not play my iTunes music via voice command. I have paid hundreds of dollars to apple to buy music legally over the years and amazon is so greedy and short sided that they refuse to integrate my iTunes purchases.","Negative"
"8008","Purchased this for my 77 year old grandmother. She's blown away by everything it does, she loves it.","Positive"
"8009","AWESOME!","Positive"
"8010","Great","Positive"
"8011","I was so excited for this product, but over the last several months I've grown incredibly weary of her ""Sorry, I didn't understand that question"" responses-- her knowledge and capabilities are far too limited. Google Home is substantially smarter and more adept at providing access to requested info. Amazon Echo, unfortunately, is just a glorified speaker (but a great, omni-directional one).","Positive"
"8012","Best Christmas gift I have given to anyone!","Positive"
"8013","Gave this as a Christmas gift to my husband and he loves it.","Positive"
"8014","She is a new member of our family!","Positive"
"8015","I received this as a gift.  This same year my son got a google home.  Saying Alexa is more personable.  That is where the Eco stops at being better.  I dont care what you call it.  I dont care about how you spell it.  It is crap.  Play a youtube video, NO.  Play a certain song, NO.  Songs you can play?  Google home has a better speaker.  I really doubt this review will stay alive on Amazon.  Why?  I have bought crap that I was like, ""this sucks. How did this get any reviews let alone the above 80% I require.  This current review is just a test.  There is no way this product should be release to the public.","Positive"
"8016","Fun","Positive"
"8017","Leaning more and more. Having a blast","Positive"
"8018","Love it","Positive"
"8019","Love it","Positive"
"8020","I love this, especially when my club first met as I talked to Alexa","Positive"
"8021","to ask how to spell a word, and she answered, one of my club ladies","Positive"
"8022","said, ""Who is she talking to?""  Smiles all around the table.  I love","Positive"
"8023","devices like this.","Positive"
"8024","Love it!!!","Positive"
"8025","Works great, lots of fun so far!","Positive"
"8026","So far - we love it!  Plays music, games, reads the news, turns lights off and on!","Positive"
"8027","We like Alexa. It became part of our family. Mostly we use it for music, radio, news and purchases on Amazon. Giving 4 stars only because Alexa doesn't recognize our voice sometimes when there is a background noise (e.g TV, or someone has conversation).","Positive"
"8028","I will come back later to give a proper review but I just stopped by to tell people this - Ask Alexa to sing a song for you.  You won't be disappointed.","Positive"
"8029","This was Christmas gift and they loved it","Positive"
"8030","Alexa seriously can't hear my voice even if I'm yelling, my boyfriend's voice on the other hand, never failed. Does anyone else have the same problem??","Negative"
"8031","Our Echo arrived in perfect time!  She has become a ""part of the family"" and we love our conversations with Alexa!","Positive"
"8032","Amazon echo is a personal assistant coupled with a full service entertainment system. My. Home is filled with great music.","Positive"
"8033","We absolutely love it! Unbelievable!","Negative"
"8034","My son has this in his house and loves it.","Positive"
"8035","Love it.  Only drawback is that you cannot print shopping list etc to a wireless printer.","Positive"
"8036","Haven't had a lot of time to play with it. But just ask you for the weather and it only gives you today's weather not tomorrows is when you ask for it","Positive"
"8037","Love Alexa","Positive"
"8038","Our 2 year old even thinks Alexa is a person :-)","Positive"
"8039","Easy to set up. It was for  my 84 year old Mom, she's loves it.","Positive"
"8040","Absolutely love Alexa. Playing music, asking for recipes, the news briefing, shopping list and just in general answering questions. Easy setup and she will even text my wife and kids for me.","Positive"
"8041","I love it.  I play music every day on it.  The speaker seems to be pretty good.  We've had some fun with silly questions and Alexa even sang us a song.  No complaints here.","Positive"
"8042","I love it!","Positive"
"8043","I enjoyed this when it worked. After 6 months it will no longer connect. I have a second Echo which works fine as well as everything else on my wifi network-only this one unit will no longer function.","Positive"
"8044","Very pleased with our Amazon Echo","Positive"
"8045","We love Alexa.","Positive"
"8046","Everything Aoki. Can't wait to hear it. Haven't had time to set it up. I hope it's easy to do. Happy New year.","Positive"
"8047","I won this product in a raffle at work. At first, I thought I wouldn't like it, but I have to admit that after watching a few youtube videos and getting it setup, I love it.","Positive"
"8048","I purchased over the past year or so several WeMo controllers and the Echo integrates flawlessly. I have also integrated a few smart bulbs, my garage door opener, thermostat, and even my camera controlled Kuna lights with minimal work. I have read some articles about APIs and 3rd party people writing code to integrate other smart devices so I'm interested in researching that more (I will update this review once I learn more)","Positive"
"8049","I was so excited to get it and have it play my music by just my voice.  It did pretty good with that but when I told it to play Roy Orbison it said there are no songs by him although I have 23 in Amazon music, purchased from Amazon,but  when I say the name of the song it will play it.  I don't want to always tell it the name of the song but just play Roy Orbison, for example.  Very disappointed.","Positive"
"8050","I love the music streaming functionality of the device as well. I can just tell it to play a song or give it part of the lyrics and it will start playing the song... that's freaking cool! BTW, the sound quality out of the speaker is pretty dang good and it gets plenty loud as well.","Positive"
"8051","There have been 2 flaws that I've found with the device to this date and they aren't deal breakers by far.","Negative"
"8052","- Although the microphone is really good, it still doesn't do the best if you aren't in the room with it unless there is no other noise in the house. (being a father of 2 girls this never happens) BUT, you can link up to 3 echo's together so you can place multiple echo's inside your house. Just be careful not to have them too close together or you might end up with some funky command deal going on.","Positive"
"8053","- You can't really have a conversation with the device... it does not retain what you asked last time which really isn't a deal breaker (none of my negatives are) but the Google home really has that going for it over the Echo.","Positive"
"8054","So the biggest question, would I buy another one? Yes. I currently own 2 (an Echo and an Echo Dot) and love them.","Positive"
"8055","rather large. the Echo Dot works great and doesn't stand out so much. Not sure why one would choose the Echo over the Dot","Positive"
"8056","Love.  Love.  Love.  It. !!!!!!!!!","Positive"
"8057","Had it for a few days and love it already.  The classic answer Alexa gave to my know-it-all college boy was priceless.  ""Alexa, are you going to take over the world?"" Alexa's response, ""No, I don't want to take over the world; I just to want help make your life easier..""  Love it!!!","Positive"
"8058","Very pleased with the Echo, the sound is amazing considering the size of the unit.  Have lots of fun playing games, asking questions and listening to our favorite music.  I highly recommend it.","Positive"
"8059","It's ok...probably not worth the money. It doesn't do much and appears to be programmed to only respond to certain topics & therefore cannot answer most things I request. Being able to input information for only one driving route is silly. Who only wants to know the drive time to one location? Multiple locations should be available to cover all areas that are frequently visited. Hopefully, new and more useful updates will occur ASAP. Rather large also so it takes up valuable counter space and isn't especially visually appealing.","Positive"
"8060","That said, she is fairly bad at answering general knowledge questions.  Amazon really needs to work on that AI if they are going to stay competitive with competing Google devices, but I am not subtracting a star for that failing because she really has had such a positive impact in our home.","Positive"
"8061","Love Alexa.  Since purchasing her I have mot played my CD's at all. Cor $3.99 a month you can have unlimited music lf your choice and it has been wonderful. I recommend it highly","Positive"
"8062","SO much fun!!!!!","Positive"
"8063","The Amazon Echo is a great gift for the techie who thinks they have everything. It's too bad it doesn't cook too.","Positive"
"8064","Phenomenal product. I wish I were as smart as Alexa.","Positive"
"8065","The device is great! The ability to control my Philips HUE lights is amazing and I even can do scenes (lighting color schemes) through the ECHO. I have Samsung Smartthings connected as well so I can control my air conditioner and fans with my voice. I have a total of three ECHOs (One Big ECHO and two ECHO DOTs). Sometimes two pickup my voice at the same time but it seems the ECHO that gets the request first wins and the other one stops what it is attempting to do. The reason why it is not a full 5 stars is the lack of multi-room audio capability. I know they are adding SONOS compatibility soon but there are so many other systems that could use some love too! I have the Samsung Multi-Room Audio System and I can only connect the ECHO DOTs to one speaker at a time while the Big ECHO can't connect to any Bluetooth speakers and only plays music through its own speaker. It is disappointing that I have a huge Bluetooth enabled soundbar with sub-woofer next to my Big ECHO and I can't play music to it from the ECHO. WHY? If Amazon can add multi-point Bluetooth to the ECHO and ECHO DOTs this would be a non-issue. I have to say everything else is FANTASTIC! I have a news briefing in the morning from whatever ECHO I'm next to at the time that I've customize to my liking, It plays pretty much any song I want from Amazon Prime, Spotify, and any channel of Pandora I'm feeling at the time. I've even asked it to play me some fun music or relaxing music and it does a great job of interpreting what music fits my mood! All-in-all I recommend it to anyone with a smart home system or anyone who is just a curious person because Alexa will answer whatever you want pretty effectively! If you like your music I recommend the ECHO DOT because it has audio out and Bluetooth audio to a speaker of your choosing. I have multiple speakers connected to my DOTs but you can only play out from one at a time and you can't switch the speaker with your voice, only through the Alexa app.","Positive"
"8066","An awesome device. Alexa works well and the music quality is good.  Easy to install and use","Positive"
"8067","AMAZING, no words to describe.  We bought it on sale but is worth every cent had we paid full price!  ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!","Positive"
"8068","The device is great but Amazon Music is unbelievably horrible. Supposedly you can upload your current music via the Amazon Music app, but trying to do anything with the app is an incredibly frustrating experience. I just spent over an hour trying to get a set of 16 tracks to upload and added to a playlist only to finally give up. Some tracks were missing, others were uploaded more than once, and others uploaded but couldn't be added to the playlist for no obvious reason. AVOID AMAZON MUSIC AT ALL COSTS BECAUSE IT IS HORRIBLE and don't buy an Echo if you are counting on uploading music to it.","Negative"
"8069","Great product","Positive"
"8070","Amazon Echo is amazing. I have had this product now for some time and really enjoy it. You get emails weekly telling you what she can now do. I have no regrets on this purchase","Positive"
"8071","She's smart, witty and has the same taste in music as me!","Positive"
"8072","I love my Echo. Alexis is great!!!  I am so happy I got one and I ordered one for my Daughter and Son-in-law.","Positive"
"8073","Received an Echo as a gift. It is functional up to an extent. Amazon should rethink the implementation of the ""skills"". It is hard for someone to remember more than 10 or more ""keywords"", to open use a specific skill. Having to also use a skill ""keyword"" is also not very intuitive.","Positive"
"8074","For example, instead of having to use: ""Alexa, ask TV shows what time Walking Dead starts"". We should be able to just ask: ""Alexa, what time does Walking Dead start."".","Negative"
"8075","I could go on and on with a list of things why this is not very intuitive. I am seriously thinking returning this for a Google Home, which i can ask normal questions, and also follow-up questions, which also doesnt work with the Echo.","Positive"
"8076","EDIT UPDATE - ALEXA NEEDS PASSWORD PROTECTION:  This is an update 15  days after installing our Echo and Dot... Alexa definitely needs some sort of password protection to keep visitors from using it at their whim.  My son's friends came to the house and annoyingly were giving commands to play loud music in my kitchen while I was watching TV.  I finally had to teach them some manners and tell them to stop.  A password for use of Alexa is very necessary to keep unmannered guests from abusing the privilege of using your personal home device!  This is definitely the first great offering of ""home robotics"" for the masses.  So cool to control my surroundings, listen to music, get weather, play games and change thermostat all with my voice.  Alexa is not only a conversation piece with party games and tricks, but it's what every household will be using as our step into the future of the robotics age. We have already connected a couple of rooms with the Phillips Hue light kits and with the Nest Thermostat.  The setup is very easy and quick.  If you run into any snags upon setup, there are many places online to get your questions answered.  I purchased the Echo and the Dot and waiting for another Echo when it becomes available.  I recommend placing the Dot in a small bedroom or home office and the Echo in a larger kitchen/Den area because it has a large speaker which does well in places where there are other noises from TV, washers/dryers, fridge motors, etc.  I will probably get the Fire TV with Alexa capability to pair with my Echo.  It works with voice control and the speaker can be used to boost TV sound when using Fire TV.  All in all, this is a great purchase with lots of potential as more and more software skills and smart home skills are added to it.  Would definitely recommend.","Positive"
"8077","I am not a happy camper. I bought this device because I wanted to surround myself with music. Friends told me all I needed to do was verbally request Echo play an artist, genre, or song. I already had Prime music, Amazon digital music purchases, and I upgraded to the $3.99 a month Amazon music unlimited. I also have Pandora. Unfortunately, although it is Dec 30, when I request an artist it defaults to Christmas music by the artist, or other religious music they've recorded. I can skip a song, but not an album. Sometimes after requesting an artist, after a song or two it defaults to unrelated Christmas music. Earlier today when I asked it to stop it wouldn't, and I had to unplug the device to stop the Christmas music. I feel like I'm being attacked. Isn't this device supposed to learn my preferences? How many dozens of times will I need to skip Christmas music before it stops defaulting to it?  I contacted Amazon and was told I need to request specific songs or albums by the artist. If I have to look up this info on my phone or laptop to request music, Echo is not a convenience. I should have just stuck to my bluetooth phone charger music player.  The US is known for it's religious freedom and diversity. Why is Christian religious music a default? Amazon, on what date will we be past Christmas?","Positive"
"8078","Pretty cool and most of the time it understands us !","Positive"
"8079","Came early and the in-laws love it","Positive"
"8080","Thought it would be fun. WRONG!  3 hrs. and still not connected.  I'm tired, frustrated and wishing I had never ventured into this unknown Bitch'","Negative"
"8081","What a great gift! It is a a great item for anyone!","Positive"
"8082","Not so good does not understand is  its best saying not very useful yet","Positive"
"8083","Awesome Echo thumbs up","Positive"
"8084","Ordered my 5 gallons of ky jelly from this. Very happy.","Positive"
"8085","Love it!  No more forgetting my shopping list at home.  I tell Alexa and can access lists and calendars from my cell phone!","Positive"
"8086","I really like the Echo so far, but it seems there is a lot to learn to get the most benefit (remembering exactly how to phrase your request to access the appropriate skill). I have mostly used it to keep up my grocery list, weather updates and news briefings. My husband has been a bit frustrated because most of his questions to Alexa result in her not being able to answer, and most of his questions should have been easily answered by searching the web. Perhaps it takes a special ""skill"" which we haven't found or downloaded yet. I will continue to use it and love it, but my husband isn't quite as enamored with it as I am.","Positive"
"8087","We have enjoyed our Echo so much!!  The music is wonderful!!  She is so helpful!  So nice to have all this information!!","Positive"
"8088","Love my echo","Positive"
"8089","Awesome","Positive"

"8091","It's wonderful!","Positive"
"8092","Great product.  It's really fun having my grandkids talk to Alexa.","Positive"
"8093","Love wished it played more games","Positive"
"8094","Not my first echo love them all","Positive"
"8095","I love this thing! I have it paired with my Harmony hub and it controls everything. Totally recommend it!","Positive"
"8096","I bought both the Echo and the tap.  The Echo has advanced capabilities like integrating with a smart home, which I don't need at all.  It's nice that the Echo is omnidirectional, but I don't care that much about that either.  Far as I can tell, the Tap has the same capabilities in terms of AI communications, only it's on a rechargeable platform, so I can pick it up and take it with me.  The Echo has to stay plugged in in order to function - which means you can't take it with you without hassle.  Oh, yes, on Tap disadvantage is t hat it has to be turned on to activate - that just means pressing a button.","Positive"
"8097","  One small other annoyance is that both the Echo and the Tap activate by us saying ""hey, Alexa"".  That means that if these are near each other, both of them come on at the same time. Not only are they both playing music at the same time, it's to a  different beat and may be entirely different music.  I don't why Amazon didn't give the two different names.","Negative"
"8098","Not easy to connect to app. Enjoy it otherwise.","Positive"
"8099","Great gift, great to have, amazing!!","Positive"
"8100","Love this!!!!!","Positive"
"8101","I ask for my new flash and the first news comes from Fox news. I always have to increase the volume from where it was it to hear the news. This is followed by NPR liberal news. Echo broadcast NPR at least two volume levels above Fox's volume level and I have to turn ask echo to turn it down. Why wouldn't the volume be consistent no matter what I listen to?","Positive"
"8102","Pretty awesome device","Positive"
"8103","Needs to be louder","Negative"
"8104","We cant use it we don't have wi fi  or a  app or a tablet","Positive"
"8105","or a phone with a app","Positive"

"8107","Seem to be more limitations to what Alexa can do than I initially thought.","Negative"
"8108","Very good","Positive"
"8109","We love it!!!","Positive"
"8110","I hate it because I ordering it November 28, and it stated it would ship by December 6th, called DEcember right before christmas, to find out that it got damaged at a facility, and back ordered till the end on January 2017...Furious, still need it for my blind mother...","Negative"

"8115","Easy  to set up. Great sound. Experiencing  new things everyday.","Positive"
"8116","It's pretty cool, but I know it will get even better at answering more questions.  Love the jokes.  Also like that when I happen to think of a song, I can hear it immediately.","Positive"
"8117","My sister got one as a gift I love it so much I bought me one too then purchased my brother 1 they are awesome we love it","Positive"
"8118","I bought this for my son and wife for Christmas and they love it.  They use it everyday.","Positive"
"8119","it works but it is very useless and lazy. it makes you lazy to even move your fingers.","Negative"
"8120","This picks up on your voice so well! The speakers are loud, and I love it!","Positive"
"8121","It is okay device .  Everyone is talking about what it controls . I want to hear the echo play music thru my smart tv/home theater.  no external audio output WHYY  Voice commanded tunes would be cool  If anyone knows how please tell","Positive"
"8122","Works great.  Still getting to learn all the features.","Positive"
"8123","I love it! I mainly wanted it for the music. I haven't looked yet at everything else Alexa can do, it's been a busy time but I will check it out soon.","Positive"
"8124","Fills the gap in my home automation system.  Integrates well with Universal-Devices ISY (Insteon/Z-wave/Zigbee), Honeywell thermostats, and three Harmony remotes via Yonomi.","Positive"
"8125","Its been a year now of using Alexa, we LOVE her in our house, use her for music, timers, jokes, weather, cooking converstions and so on to other many things, shes very handy, convenient  and amussing, actually very amusing. Altho there are times we ask her things and she doesnt know them, for some reason she only can tell some of college football, she doesnt our team which is weird since its VT, so i think they need to work out some things with her and work out those things but Alexa is amazing all around","Positive"
"8126","Great choice.  Lots of fun.","Positive"
"8127","Received as a gift. Honestly, did not get the hype surrounding this thing before, but now that I've had it for about a week, I can't imagine being without it. This thing truly is amazing! For one, the voice analyzer is far superior to Siri (and I'm a self-proclaimed Applephile), and has a much broader range. TuneIn for local stations, Spotify & Prime for playlists (not to mention my entire Prime library) and instant traffic and weather are things I never knew I was missing. Lastly, the sound from such a small unit is far superior than you'd imagine. Highly recommend... especially if you're a notorious multi-tasker (or lazy) like me.","Positive"
"8128","I bought this mainly to stream music since I work from home. Having to deal with constant commercials and dj's from traditional radio became annoying. Not only does the echo allow me to stream music from various services including the prime music I get but having Alexa has become addictive for other things such as getting news updates, weather and traffic. I honestly don't know how I have managed to live without this device.","Negative"
"8129","I bought two of these Echos as gifts at $179, and Amazon then dropped the price by $40 each. Not only was I stuck with overpayment as my reward for early ordering, but my recipients could see how inexpensive their gifts were. Once burned . . ..","Negative"
"8130","worked great for 14 months, out of warranty - out of luck.","Positive"

"8132","We love our Alexa!","Positive"
"8133","love it so far; but I would like it to be more interactive. Amazon saying that Alexia would be getting smarter as time pass. will see and will update if need to be.","Positive"
"8134","Bought this for my husband for Christmas but we are both enjoying it!!!  I love that I can get music on whenever I want!  He enjoys asking Alexa questions on sports and weather.","Positive"
"8135","Very nice","Positive"
"8136","I got my Alexa from my brother for my birthday and I have now purchased for my daughters birthday which unfortunatelly his on back order- but she loved mine so much! -Even my 2 year old granddaughter was going up to her and staying Alexa play ""let it go"" and Alexa said I like the polite way you are asking!!!!","Positive"
"8137","Mine seems to improve every day so anyone can go up to it and ask- no longer needing voice recognition.","Positive"
"8138","This was a gift. We love our echo. She's informative and keeps all of us entertained!!","Positive"
"8139","Amazon Echo-Black is a lot of fun and entertaining.","Positive"
"8140","The Blue connect light wont come on to activate - basically wont boot up. Talked with customer support for 1/2 an hour with two different people. because it is out of warranty, nothing they can do.","Positive"
"8141","Love love love!!! Use it daily! So many options. I recently hooked up smart lights tjat can be controlled by Alexa","Positive"
"8142","It's a bit difficult to use - i.e. I can't say ""do this"" I have to remember to say ""ask (name of the app installed) to (do exactly this task)"". So, that's annoying. Plays music well, sounds nice, good for news, good for music, good for starting my car, but overhyped. Siri + a Bluetooth speaker is comparable, the rest of the features are not really there yet.","Positive"
"8143","Met all expectations although the app Interlude with prime music is confusing","Negative"
"8144","Wife loves it","Positive"
"8145","I love Echo, I love the jokes, the music, and the day in history","Positive"
"8146","It is a disgrace that this does not sync to the apple calendar","Negative"
"8147","Not exactly as advertised.  To play any music, artist by name, etc. you need to add Amazon Prime at the cost of $99 per year plus.  However, it does well with Pandora.  I am still learning how to use the features and I really like it.","Positive"
"8148","I got the Echo for Christmas and It can control six of my light switches and two of my thermostats. I have used the shopping list twice. The music is fantastic too. I have used the skills set to order pizza among other things. I am thrilled to be a owner of the Amazon Echo. There is so much it is capable of doing and I have just gotten started.","Positive"
"8149","It is like having a partner in the room with me.  All the music is great.  I sometimes am disappointed in the answering of questions. I thought  would it  be able to answer most of my questions but misses on most.","Positive"
"8150","My spouse got these, and I didn't expect to like them much, but find we use them quite a bit for weather, time, dinner music, asking questions, etc. There are some privacy issues to be considered, so be aware that you can go to your devices section of your account an delete things you might not be comfortable with Amazon storing.","Positive"
"8151","Fun gadget to have! Works great!","Positive"
"8152","We got this a couple of weeks ago, and it's been fun. We are still learning about Alexa's capabilities, and though there are more than a few things that she doesn't seem to understand, it might be the way we are asking the questions also. The speaker is awesome, and really fills the room when we play music! All in all, a good purchase.","Positive"
"8153","What a great  time we had playing music and searching the Web.","Positive"
"8154","I couldn't really tell you how well Echo works considering I spent hours trying to set it up. It will not connect to my wifi. It won't even try. I have searched Amazon and watched YouTube videos and nothing has helped. Very disappointed. I wouldn't have a problem sending it back and trying a new one but Amazon is out of stock until the end of January. Not happy.","Positive"
"8155","Works great!!!  Can't wait to discover everything that it can do.","Positive"
"8156","Was a gift, 1 each for each of my adult kids. They all seem to enjoy it and one of them wants 2 more for their home. We have the full blown echo and it's really well built. Couldn't pass on these for the price though. Ordered another dot for upstairs so I can have wemo make my coffee before I get out of bed.","Positive"
"8157","Have not experimented with all the features, but as for just setting up and using, we love it!","Positive"
"8158","NO APP FOR CANADA.... USELESS!!","Negative"
"8159","I have enjoyed Amazon Echo so much, I gave it also to family for Christmas as a gift.","Positive"
"8160","Best money I've spent on electronics in along time. Highly recommend.  Will not be disappointed.  Sound quality is excellent","Positive"
"8161","Amazing product I use it everyday for my morning alarm and for music around the house.","Negative"
"8162","Horrible! It cant hear you over half volume. Never responds. The Echo Dot hears me upstairs before this does. Customer support his absolutely pathetic, learn spanish or indian. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!","Negative"
"8163","quality of sound good","Positive"
"8164","Whole family down to my 8yr old by use Alexa. Music, timers, lists, general questions. You guys need it to make it make whale sounds like the google device commercial. That is shaking my kids confidence in Echo","Positive"
"8165","My wife loves it, when she is happy, I am very happy!!!!!","Positive"
"8166","I have been waiting for the Echo to go on Black Friday sale and picked it up then. The radio speaker feature was my primary reason for the purchas but the additional cloud features are such a great advantage. Hard to tell you how much I use Echo except I use it all day most days.","Negative"
"8167","LOVE","Positive"
"8168","it's wonderful,and fun to use","Positive"
"8169","I've learned to really like the Echo, and I use it daily.  As a matter of fact--my whole family has begun to use it, effectively, on a daily basis.","Positive"
"8170","Whether the stand-alone Echo is worth the price is a question worth asking--when one can get the Dot and a quality bluetooth speaker for less.  The sound quality on the Echo is...alright.  I'm picky, and it's well-enough for casual use.  It can play surprisingly loud without appreciable distortion--which was surprising.  The sound is clear and certainly well enough for voice; and it's well-enough for music.  We keep ours about 10 inches away from the wall for better microphone sensitivity and sound quality.  Since buying this Echo, we've bought 4 Dots...so I'm certainly a believer in the technology.  Since I'm already an audio-gear guy, it's just better sounding and more cost-effective to buy the Dots and plug them into my existing sound systems.","Positive"
"8171","I've also found that the Little Bear P5-1 (which is a Musical Fidelity X-10D clone) is a great addition to the Dot when connecting via the 3.5mm miniplug.  It really adds a greater sound stage, while smoothing out the digital edge.  Again--I'm a believer, as I already own 4 Dots and 3 of these in-line valve buffers.","Positive"
"8172","Love her. Don't use her as often as we thought but it's nice to ask her the time without getting out of bed or the temperature outside while getting ready to go outside.","Positive"
"8173","Google is better at natural language interpretation and finding answers to questions. However Echo has a bigger smart home ecosystem, for now. This class of devices is in its infancy. Today it is a novelty that is useful but limited. A few more years' development and it will become as indispensable as the smartphone.","Positive"
"8174","Does not link with Verizon FIOS without help from Verizon. took 4 days to get Echo to work and 3 hours on phone. Issue was 100% Echo issue and had to reset router security  to work with Echo and after hours on the phone it works.","Positive"
"8175","What makes this even better is the $79 Unlimited  music plan for a year or just a few dollars a month for the Echo alone. All I have to say is ""Alexa, Play Side to Side by Ariana Grande and it plays it no problem. So f****** easy!!! I'm already spoiled Amazon, thanks! Bottom line is I love my Echo!!!","Positive"
"8176","husband loves it.","Positive"
"8177","I bought one for my husband for Father's Day we loved it so much we ended up ordering another one for our kitchen. The kids think this is totally awesome to use during homework time. This is a purchase you will not regret!","Positive"
"8178","Fantastic .....need say no more","Positive"
"8179","We got one for Christmas and have already given it away because we are disappointed in the way it works.  They say it does not have additional costs but it is all about hooks into other fee based services.  Most of the basic questions we asked could not be answered by Alexa. We have a prime account but could not get Alexa to play any music we are interested in.  Very disappointed in the product.","Negative"
"8180","LOVE our Echo!!!  Alexa is amazing.  We are ""older"" but we gave our son Alexa for Christmas so he is educating us on all the possibilities with this amazing device. I would recommend the Amazon Echo to anyone and everyone...young or old!  I love listening to the oldies!","Positive"
"8181","Still a little new to it but both are still learning.  Hookup instruction aren't as clear as they could be.  Your lead to think you need to own a smart phone to hook up to your wifi but you can do it on a PC.  You just need a little geek intellect.  May Amazon will read enough of these and re-write the instructions.  Sound is excelent.  I got it for my wife so she could have her music and so far it's seem to always be on.  I'm going to get a wireless speaker with blue tooth so she can hear it in other rooms without raising the volume.","Positive"
"8182","Absolutely love it! We bought 2 of the echo dots because we love so much!!!!","Positive"
"8183","Works as good as new.  We love the Echo!  Use it for controlling Heat / AC, Lighting, listening to music, news, everything you see and read about Echo is true.  So much better the Google or Siri.  We gave Echos / Dots for xmass gifts this year and the whole family enjoys.","Positive"
"8184","This is a fun item to use and I don't know how I survived manually pairing my phone to a speaker for so long.","Positive"
"8185","Love it!","Positive"
"8186","Alexa is some thing you just can't live without.  From alarms to wake you with no blaring trumpets in your ear, to traffic updates, to music on Pandora to Jeopardy and tons of other fun applications, Alexa is just fun and very helpful..  I love that I can get up to date weather and even delays in the subways of New York or trains in Chicago...it's my favorite gadget and I look forward to even more applications, which seem to occur weekly.","Positive"
"8187","There is a function that provides almost immediate help if you have a problem....they speak English and know their product.!!","Positive"
"8188","I first saw her the echo when I visited my son in NC.  I ordered mine after I returned home. I love it !!!  While doing my housework today I asked Alexa to play Beatles music from the 60s - I think it lauded for hours! Great sound!!!","Positive"
"8189","I am greatly disappointed with this purchase.  I bought this for my husband who is disabled (blind) and daughter (low vision and poor fine motor) hoping they could rely on this less than surfing the net.  First of all, unless you subscribe to Amazon music, the music library is very limited.  It cannot connect to our iTunes unless each and every time we sit down on the computer and make the connection manually. For two folks disabled, it is easier to just play iTunes off the computer.  The weather app is worthless.  It gives the high and low and current temperature of the day and whether there will be precipitation. But it gives us no idea how much.  Really.  a dusting of snow? a inch?  2 feet?  Nope, just ""snow is in the forecast"".  The to do list, alarm and reminder features are cool, but I expected more from a cylinder we paid $129 for (on Black Friday. otherwise it would have been $179).  Other than these 3 cool features, it seems it is only good at parlor tricks.  During Christmas dinner we got into a discussion on a movie and the question was raised who directed it.  Without getting  up, we asked Alexa.  Way cool.  But worth $129-$179?  Not really.","Positive"
"8190","This is a most awesome product. Easy set-up, great sound, and intuitive. Just finished setting up my playlist (music), the response...and again the sound is fantastic...thanks, Amazon.","Positive"
"8191","WOW.  This is incredible.  I live alone (yes, some reviewers have said 'it's something to talk to'), but it's much more than that.  With the Echo I can keep a calendar, make lists, listen to what I want to at anytime, etc.  Setting alarms and timers is so very useful, and if I am working on a project Echo will read an audio book while I do that (that's an additional charge, but through Prime I got several credits for free).  I access the Alexa page via PC only because I've not gotten around to (or maybe can't?) access via phone (I'm an android user).","Positive"
"8192","Birthday gift - wanted to love it but NO.  By the time I got her to understand what I wanted her to do, I could have done it myself","Positive"
"8193","I have one Echo and two Dots.  One dot is in the kitchen for timers, lists and music while I cook and clean.  The other dot is in my bedroom for wakeup alarms (say ""Alexa, Snooze"" and you'll get another 9 minutes or so!) and to play soothing music before I sleep, and then I ask for current news (""Alexa, Flash Briefing"") and weather before I get out of bed in the morning), and the Echo is in my study for music, questions, games, plans, audio books, etc.","Positive"
"8194","Once you get hooked up, I highly recommend visiting the voice training more than once.  It will fine-tune to your voice.  ""Word Master"" (a 'skill' you can enable on your Alexa page) has sometimes confused my answers, mistaking the word I said for something similar.  But I expect this will improve.","Positive"
"8195","I've not hooked up lights to Echo, that will wait for a while, just because I don't need it right now.","Positive"
"8196","All in all, this is astonishing, and I see huge potential for the future.","Positive"
"8197","Enjoying the Amazon Echo!","Positive"
"8198","I love white Amazon Echo, for all it does and the sound is awesome!!!","Positive"
"8199","So far it is awesome. Haven't used it at this point to do anything but play music. I will be using it for ordering my regular items from Amazon. As I said so far it is awesome.","Positive"
"8200","We are having more fun with Alexa during the holidays.  Very entertaining and so easy. Ed","Positive"
"8201","Alexa and I are getting to know each other.  So far so good.  Just thrilled with so much easy knowledge.","Positive"
"8202","the b est thing ever love it","Positive"
"8203","This is an expensive toy that must be plugged in and carried from room to room.","Negative"
"8204","LOVE OUR NEW ECHO! I have been watching the reviews online and checking with friends that have purchased the Echo to see how much they liked or disliked its features. Last person I talked to went on and on about all the things there were using it for and that persuaded me it was time and Amazon Prime Day was the perfect opportunity to go for it. Amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular info-taining command center! There are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that I'll hit the highlights that work for our household. First, we love that it follows your voice in the room (the circle lighting will show which direction it is 'listening'), the speaker is wonderfully balanced, so whether listening to music, the news or to Alexa speaking, I have nothing but high marks for its sound quality, given its size. Next, set up (after downloading the app to our iPhones) was quick, easy and very intuitive. The more you look over the app, the more you will realize a world of 'skills' (as Amazon refers to them - we've nicked named them ""echolettes"" LOL) that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them. We've added things to shopping lists, while asking about the weather and our calendar of events and then asked Alexa to change the temp of our Nest thermostats in various parts of the house, simply by saying her name and then our commands, sometimes sitting in the living room or simply pass through - she is always there listening and ready. We've ordered some LED programmable lights and I can hardly wait for Alexa to help set the mood in the house, room to room, all from a simple voice request. Even though we are fairly tech savvy and have phone, tablets and watches that can control devices, its HUGE to just ask for something and a pleasant voice setting it in motion.","Positive"
"8205","I am a regular Amazon Prime shopper and reviewer, if my review helped you in making up your mind about whether to purchase the Echo, please mark the 'Helpful' button, it tells Amazon that folks are in fact reading reviews like this. Thanks!","Positive"
"8206","Love it! Works perfectly!! Much better then Siri!!","Positive"
"8207","Bought this as a Christmas present for my wife and so far she loves it!","Positive"
"8208","Overrated. Do not buy it unless you have money to spare. Most of the features of Alexa is already on your cell phones.","Negative"
"8209","It looks like the Echo was dented when it arrived but Amazon is replacing it. Amazon is fantastic.","Positive"
"8210","easy setup. works great. Very cool!  Purchased some connected devices to go along with it.  Only wish is they connect it with SONOS.","Positive"
"8211","Wonderful!!!","Positive"
"8212","Very good to have around. A+","Positive"
"8213","So far, so good.  After the learning curve, this will do well and be a true convenience.","Positive"
"8214","still don't know what the Echo is capable of doing.not worth the price.","Positive"
"8215","Amazing, what can I say. Worth every penny. So many choose your own adventure stories, and the music is great.","Positive"
"8216","Great product. Plays my music, controls my Nest thermostat, and tells me the weather.","Positive"
"8217","Love this. Great speaker and plays great stations","Positive"
"8218","It like having a smart friend in my house.","Positive"
"8219","Amazing!","Positive"
"8220","WOW this is the best item I ever perched, you always have someone to talk to...","Positive"
"8221","easy to connect and use daily!","Positive"
"8222","Does all that it said it would.  Setup for Spanish is not very user friendly and the Alexa app is not good.","Positive"
"8223","Great item. The speaker could use a little tweaking but it's not really made for the speaker. It's a great item to have in the house to ask questions and get the weather and all kinds of other things. The best part is it can make things so much easier as in connecting with Hue light bulbs and other devices to help out around the house. Sometimes it don't understand me very well but it's getting better all the time. It seems to learn your speech and gets better over time.","Positive"
"8224","Great... and getting better..","Positive"
"8225","Love it.","Positive"
"8226","I love it","Positive"
"8227","I have fun using the echo, it's informative, fun and love the way I can choose any kind of music and she will play, to getting the weather, news briefing, playing games and even reading books to you. Getting scores for your favorite team and when they play next.","Positive"
"8228","great,great and great","Positive"
"8229","For customers like me in Australia the device is not fully supported. It's also hard to set up via the iOS app as you can't download it in the AppStore. Once setup tho it's great :)","Positive"
"8230","Love it!!!!!!","Positive"
"8231","It's a lot of fun. Learning to a lot of things to do.","Positive"
"8232","This is amazing.  I can't wait to get everything coordinated with Echo.","Negative"
"8233","Absolutely love this item. Great purchase.","Positive"
"8234","Speaker mediocre and no treble/bass adjustments, sounds flat","Negative"
"8235","Having fun learning all about how it works. Takes a little time. But we re all enjoying it","Positive"
"8236","A fun little item.  I has the wow factor for a lot of people and pumps out some fantastic sound as well.  It ratcheted up my coolness factor a few points with my techy friends.","Positive"
"8237","Awesome","Positive"
"8238","Very Happy with it.","Positive"
"8239","awesome","Positive"
"8240","Full of hope being that it's an Amazon product. So disappointed that we had no choice but to return it.","Negative"
"8241","Outstanding piece of equipment the only drawback that it is stable cannot be moved around","Positive"
"8242","This device exceeded our expectations!!!! What a wonderful gift!  Alexa is such fun and does so, so many things. Amazing.","Positive"
"8243","Mostly useless. It can play music and read books while you are busy doing other things. However unless you are a materialistic consumer, it has no real purpose. It is basically commercialism that you pay for. Sorry, not for me. I burn and block ads as soon as I can. Any research that I have asked it came back with poor results. To keep the thing from recording every blessed thing in my house I have to unplug it. I'm sure my habits are valuable information to corporations trying to sell me crap.","Negative"
"8244","Love it!!","Positive"
"8245","What's with the $3.99 a month fee for music?","Positive"
"8246","We, as a family, love Alexa!!  My youngest thoroughly enjoys playing around with her.  She is fun and informative in many ways.  We've also bought the Harmony hub and hooked it all in with the entertainment system, tv, surround, and bluray player, along with using IFTTT.  Alexa has exceeded expectations thus far.  I think she is a wise choice for those who enjoy the automation side of the world, especially for the cost, and her skills are growing constantly.  I have also gotten an Echo Dot for my room and plan to get atleast one more for the kids' rooms. I am extremely happy with Alexa, and do not regret my purchase in the least.  In fact, I highly recommend her to everyone I know, and strangers who read this!!  Thanks Amazon for yet another amazing creation!!!","Positive"
"8247","Fantastic.","Positive"
"8248","I might not be Techy enough.  Frustrates me like Siri","Positive"
"8249","So good I bought another one. I already paid for  Amazon prime nest and auto lights.","Positive"
"8250","Took me a long time to get on board with the echo but I am glad I did!  This thing is awesome.  I have a smart home so it's nice that it works with Ecobee and Phillips Hue to where I can turn on my lights and control my temperature through this.  Speaker is great as well.  Has a hard time hearing my kids sometimes and if i am across the room I do have to repeat myself a couple of times before I see the blue ring to show me it is listening but overall a great device.  I did have both this and google home at the same time to test both devices.  I went with this one due to the third party capabilities.  Google home is more ""fun"" than this, but this is more functional.  Google home could tell me how to play a card game or and seemed a bit more ""human"" with the conversation skills but this for me was the overall winner due to smart home capability.  Great job Amazon, keep it up.  The echo dot is awesome as well, I put one in my basement and it turns on my TV through Harmony app and works flawless!","Positive"
"8251","My husband received this for Christmas and loved the sound and the easy set up. Love Alexa! She is quick to get your info. Being a picky guy he was impressed with this product. He has used it everyday. Awesome gift!","Positive"
"8252","loving it","Positive"
"8253","We're having a lot of fun learning about Alexa.  Live that I can sync my laptop and play ITunes Playlists.  Speakers are great.  Listening to classical music now.","Positive"
"8254","Love it!","Positive"
"8255","Great product! Can't wait to see all the things it will keep learning!","Negative"
"8256","Having fun with Alexa so far. Unable to use it with my calendar because I sync to my work calendar and email. Couldn't decided between this one and Google Home, but landed on the Echo because of the ability to re-order from Amazon or Search Amazon.","Positive"
"8257","Absolutely LOVE my Amazon Echo!!","Positive"
"8258","I bought the Echo because it had all the apps that I listen to (iHeartRadio and Spotify) plus the flash briefings are good to have. I wish there was more selections on Flash Briefings. Other than that Alexa is useful to have as it can tell weather, commute times, news reports, having exclusive deals, buying from the device, and other ""skills"" like meditation and whatnot. So far I have no gripes apart from me having to speak loud from time to time since Alexa can't hear me, though I may have to retrain the device again to recognize my voice. Other than that I do recommend the Echo since it is pretty useful and the sound is excellent for the price.","Positive"
"8259","What can I say. I love Alexa. We've purchase several and Dots too!","Positive"
"8260","My girlfriend and I really like Alexa/Echo. We are getting better using it every day and Alexa seems to get more intuitive with us every day. Sometimes she really surprises us and makes us laugh at her responces. We also went for the Amazon Unlimited Music monthly. Would definitely recommend it.","Positive"
"8261","It surpassed our expectations.  It is so sensitive to its name when we talk about it we use the term ""you no who"" so as not to activate it.  Highly recommend.","Positive"
"8262","Love it but I'm still learning what she can do.","Positive"
"8263","Very cool. Still learning it","Positive"
"8264","I would have given it a five but. I have several times where it didnot do anything. Have talked to Tech support and they tried to help. It is one of those things where it is sporatic and of coarse with anything it has to be consistent. Maybe be something with my internet service as they are less the desirable.  I bought this for my husband for christmas. He likes being able to call the old music up that is no longer playing. I don't know why anyone would want to pay for the music  as there is so much music out there. I love the quality coming out of the speakers sounds like a big system. But other then the problem I stated above.Loved Loved Loved it. Little suggestion for techs at Amazon would like to be able to send the grocery list to my wireless printer but I have talked to several people and there doesn't seem to be any way right now.","Positive"
"8265","Love alexa","Positive"
"8266","Great","Positive"
"8267","Alexia is a great device all round, I use it almost everyday. However if you are expecting strong storms or other causes of power outages please unplug her. This morning we had a large storm blow through and when the power went off and came back on I was awoken to ""hello"" at 3 o'clock am. The dogs went crazy and as afraid as I Am to admit it it scared me a little to. So I love Alexia, but if you are expecting power outages UNPLUG her l. Or you will have hello being said through your house when you are the only one In it lt.","Positive"
"8268","I have an amazon echo and my mom loved to play with it. She even asked Alexa one day what she wanted for Christmas as a hint.","Positive"
"8269","It has all of the benefits of the dot with the built in speaker. I haven't used it much, but the speaker seems to be well made with a strong bass and loud. She doesn't use it as much as I do or to the extent, but she loves it. She had a concussion earlier in the year and this has helped her to remember stuff or add things to her list when she does remember it.","Positive"
"8270","This is the best adult toy ever!","Positive"
"8271","Amazing product that learns as you use it.","Positive"
"8272","I love the ability to listen to what ever song is in my head by just talking to Alexa.  It's much quicker than typing and searching in Spotify.  I can ask it to reliably shuffle play my playlists.  Works seemlessly with Wemo smart plug.  Very impressed with its ability to understand me and my family.  My anti-tech wife was so impressed she asked me to buy 2 more to give away as gifts.","Positive"
"8273","IT IS GREAT","Positive"
"8274","Love this. Enjoy being able to ask it anything. Got one for my mom and she is really enjoying it.","Positive"
"8275","I purchased this for my dad thinking he would enjoy throwing out questions, quickly getting answers and just exploring what all he could use it for. He promptly set it up without a hitch upon getting it home Christmas night. The clarity of the sound when Alexa answers is amazing.  My dad asked Alexa to add milk to the grocery list and she responded that she added milk.  He was beaming from ear to ear.  On his smartphone he can access that list, which my mom found comical because, he doesn't go the store, she does and she doesn't have the smart phone.  I think they are going to enjoy exploring all they can use Alexa for.  I would highly recommend the Echo. It has a clean look, voice clarity is amazing and the versatility is endless.  I was so excited watching them interact with the Echo that I'm going to order one for myself!","Positive"
"8276","i LOVE IT .  SHE CAN DO JUST ABOUT ANY THING  YOU ASK HER TO DO. i LOVE THE MUSIC THAT SHE PICKS . ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY ALEXA  FIND WHAT EVERY SONG YOU WANT AND SHE FINDS IT","Positive"
"8277","A whole new world with Alexa at our beck and call!","Positive"
"8278","We love the Echo and we are just learning what Alexa can do","Positive"
"8279","Love my Amazon Echo. So easy to set up and sound is Super for this item. I am new to Echo but I should have purchased sooner. Alexa will be a Great Teacher! Sound is easy on the ears and she just sits there waiting for you to ask her something!! Please read the other outstanding reviews on this item. I will sound like a broken record. Amazon Echo will help disabled people and all people. Just get it! You won't be sorry. It will be one of the best purchases you ever made!!","Positive"
"8280","Great product.  Does everything and more.","Positive"
"8281","Love the sound for my music.","Positive"
"8282","What an incredible device! This is everything it was built to be.","Positive"
"8283","I enjoy working with Alexa. This will be a good product once i learn how to use it.","Positive"
"8284","love it","Positive"
"8285","Very happy with my ECHO!","Positive"
"8286","Got this as a gift for my daughter. We love it! Lots of fun and easy to set up and use. We linked our Pandora account to the Echo which gives us tons of options for music. Would recommend it to anyone.","Positive"
"8287","Great product but still needs some work. Alexa doesn't always hear or understand me and the list and to do list gets scrambled a lot. Great for hearing weather and news but still working on getting the other things right.","Positive"
"8288","Love it!  The sound is great and tons of apps are available and more to come!","Positive"
"8289","Have really enjoyed the amazon echo","Positive"
"8290","It doesn't get loud enough.","Negative"
"8291","It does a lot more than what I thought!  LOVE IT!","Positive"
"8292","Sounds quality great, controls my lights, tv, plugs, thermostat, and more. Fun games and activities for the whole family. Nice to sit down and listen to music or audiobooks. I will always have alexa in my home to help out","Positive"
"8293","Oh everybody knows Alexa Is the BEST !!!! : )","Positive"
"8294","LOVE this! I got it for myself (from my hubby) for Christmas! We are having lots of fun discovering what Alexa can do! I was happy that it dropped $40 in price while in my cart, so I couldn't pass it up. Then I just had to wait for Christmas to justify the purchase!","Positive"
"8295","Good deal","Positive"
"8296","Awsome product . One of the coolest things I own.","Positive"
"8297","I bought this from Amazon on sale. Unfortunately it didn't work and the ""technician"" who responded to my contact was the usual idiot: ""Was the power on?"" question after I stated that it shut off shortly after startup. Doesn't ""shut off"" sort of imply that it had to be powered on?","Negative"
"8298","Pleased","Positive"
"8299","This echo is currently sitting in our kitchen getting used dozens of times a day. Quick timers, ingredient conversions, product ordering, news, temperature control (nest), music. And yes, we've ordered a Pizza. Whenever people ask ""why don't you use your phone""... Because unlike so many we aren't tethered to our phones, and the echo doesn't need to be unlocked and touched to be useful. We liked it so much a second was purchased for the bathroom. If Amazon can get it integrated into the Fire TV and control Sonos volume, it'll be an even more indispensable part of our home.","Positive"
"8300","Love the Echo! Sound is Great and the grand kids love it!","Positive"
"8301","this is a great product, kids love to ask it to tell jokes.","Positive"
"8302","I got the ECHO for Christmas and love it.  I have connected it to our Harmony hub and can control what we watch by voice, I love selecting music to play easily with Alexa, and I got a Belkin WeMo plug and can turn the light on and off.  It's just the beginning!  I can't wait to do more!","Positive"
"8303","Below my expectations.Very limited and input has to be in exact phrasing. Return both of them.","Negative"
"8304","Much Much Louder higher sound quality then the Dot puts out.  Have in the Kitchen which is next to the Living Room so we can use it for Music etc easily. At its loudest setting it has a hard time telling your trying to get it to do something.  But at its highest its a bit excessive anyhow.  If you need something that loud or louder they make Amplifiers and speakers for that...","Negative"
"8305","No complaints with the certified refurbished version.  We have a regular brand new echo to compare and we find no difference.  Do not hesitate to buy.","Negative"
"8306","My husband loves his echo","Positive"
"8307","Transaction went smoothly. Extremely happy with the echo. Still learning how to get the most out of it.","Positive"
"8308","Initially the Echo was responsive to my voice, but recently it more often than not does NOT recognize the ""alexa"" spoken prompt when the device is playing audio.  This problem has gotten worse over time.  If you read online forums, you will see this as a common complaint.","Negative"
"8309","Everyone needs Alexa. She's a great present and a fabulous buy.","Positive"
"8310","Love it, love it, love it!  No problems so far.","Positive"
"8311","love the thing, great gift!","Positive"
"8312","It's great","Positive"
"8313","it was a surprise christmas gift....I did not know what an ""Echo"" was...I mean I'd seen it on ads but didn't pay attention. I thought it was just another bluetooth speaker.  WOW was I surprised.  Just wish it was battery powered so I could take it around with me","Positive"
"8314","Certified Refurbished Amazon Echo ...Like new.  Works perfectly.","Positive"
"8315","Love it!  New features announced are great. Recommended to friends who all bought","Positive"
"8316","Totally met our/my expectations.  Having a lot of fun with it.  Exploring possibilities.","Positive"
"8317","The service on these devices is awful. I received one for christmas never worked. They only have black replacement power adaptors available. To spent 180 dollars on a device that doesn't work and now doesn't match is ridiculous. There is no excuse.","Positive"
"8318","So far, so good.  Still learning what all it can do.","Positive"
"8319","Too hard to set up to the apple computer. We sent it back.","Negative"
"8320","One word- AMAZING!  My birthday was yesterday,12/28/16. My husband lit the candles and asked Alexa to sing ""Happy Birthday! She did and it made his candle filled cake surprise even better!! What a great product!!!","Positive"
"8321","Very happy with this product.","Positive"
"8322","Makes my wife super happy","Positive"
"8323","I do like my Alexa but she's not very bright. Lots of unanswered questions.","Positive"
"8324","We absolutely love it.","Positive"
"8325","I love it","Positive"
"8326","Not sure what the big hype is about with the Amazon Echo.  I did get one for Christmas but returned it.  Most of the time Alexa didn't understand the questions we asked so we have to learn to reword the question so she could understand.  Very frustrating.","Negative"
"8327","We tested our android phones with ""ok google"" process and it never missed the question.  We even worded Echo and Google the same question and Echo didn't understand...Ok Google got it.","Negative"
"8328","Amazed at all these 5 star reviews. This thing is so UNIMPRESSIVE. 90 percent of the time it is unable to answer simple questions. You spend more time trying to ""reword"" things, to make this rather stupid device understand, than I care to admit. The quality of this speaker is a little above a clock radio.  I see what they mean when they say ""Amazon rushed this to the market to beat Google Home"". It was a rush that created a crummy product. Quite possibly will be returned.","Positive"
"8329","Gave it to mother in law for Christmas.  Works great","Positive"
"8330","I really loved my Echo (I have a dot, too) but it only has a one year warranty, after which Amazon doesn't do anything to repair or replace, just offers a $20 discount on a new one. Mine developed a problem with the microphone -- at least that's what I think. Tech support was surprisingly unhelpful.","Positive"
"8331","Love it!","Positive"
"8332","Love it. Audio quality great","Positive"
"8333","I hope the big wigs are looking at this. I really love the music and some of the games. BUT why can't y'all get the answers like google home!  It's not hard to get that software. I ask simple questions and Alexa always says don't understand the question.  I can say it 5 different ways and still Alexa can't answer it but I can ask the same questions on the google home and it works fine!  Also directions. Alexa can't do that either.  Please amazon look into changing those softwares because I know I am not the only person complaining about it.","Positive"
"8334","We have several Amazon Dots around the house, and one Amazon Echo in the kitchen. The Dots work great when connected to computer speakers, or just resting as stand-alone devices in your bedroom for simple requests like wakeup alarms and sleep aid noises.","Positive"
"8335","The Echo on the otherhand, is now an ESSENTIAL part of our Kitchen/Living room. I have it play whatever music is stuck in my head when I'm eating dinner thanks to its inegration with Amazon Music Unlimited. I set kitchen timers, play games with the roommates while we're conversating in the common area, ask it the weather before work in the morning, or even random trivial things when we're curious like an actor's age. The Echo responds very quickly compared to other voice recognition softwares, and has a much more pleasing voice. The speak is loud and rich!","Positive"
"8336","I couldn't be more pleased!","Positive"
"8337","worked as expected, great product!","Positive"
"8338","BEST purchase ever!!!! The sound quality is incredible and Alexa has made my life Modena organized and efficient!!!","Positive"
"8339","Awful","Negative"
"8340","Interesting and fun","Positive"
"8341","Absolutely wonderful piece of technology. Very happy I invested in this. The speaker is great for the size and I haven't had any problems except her misunderstanding me every once in a while. This has improved how I do things in my day to day life, and it continues to impress me. If you are on the fence about it I recommend just doing it.","Positive"
"8342","Bought this for myself but my husband is using it all the time and thinks it's the greatest.","Positive"
"8343","Gift for husband and he is thrilled with it. Set up is an ongoing project to load music, etc but well worth the investment","Positive"
"8344","it was a gift for my husband and he loves it","Positive"
"8345","The echo true amazing and useful addition to home technology. The echo performs tasks flawlessly . The more you use it and incorporate it ones life style, the smarter it gets. Pairs up with Bluetooth items and Phillips hue lighting very well. The echo is a must have no brainier.","Positive"
"8346","Great product. Really enjoying the ease with which it works.","Positive"
"8347","Alexa ""Amazon Echo"" is in my opinion a big disappointment. First off why call it echo but when you want to talk to it you call it alexa? It (she) doesn't have a good search engine or maybe not one at all. It wouldn't even play all the songs from spotify. If all you want is an alarm clock and to ask it the weather and order some things from amazon then get the echo. But Im sending it back and trying out the Google home.","Positive"
"8348","I love my Echo l just wish it had more skills like a night light, or easier commands sometimes it is hard to remember what to say to open the skills.","Positive"
"8349","Got the echo on Black Friday. Amazon had a great $139 deal on this thing and I couldn't pass it up. I gave it to my parents for Christmas. So far it works great. I like how Alexa pretty much knows anything from spelling a word to how the weather is outside. It's amazing. Now having to go to your phone or computer everything you want to know something. Just ask away.  She is neat and smart! No complaints so far.","Positive"
"8350","Love it!","Positive"
"8351","I love Echo. However, I seems to be lacking more general knowledge. It needs to link up to google or another search engine. I get a LOT of ""I didnt understand the question"" on simple requests for info. Echo and Alexa are great, but I deduct a star for that purpose.","Positive"
"8352","My wife and I love our Echo it is all that we expected.","Positive"
"8353","The only problem I have with it it's not portable you can charge the batteries and go","Negative"
"8354","Great addition to our home!","Positive"
"8355","I originally purchased this item as a birthday present for my husband. However, I probably use it a lot more often than he does. Echo makes it so easy to find the answer to many questions without stopping what you are doing. It is very helpful when cooking/baking or ordering items from Amazon.","Positive"
"8356","I love that I can easily listen to my favorite radio station or playlist. I can easily ask Alexa to play my music on Spotify or my favorite artist on Pandora. And the fact that I can have her read me my Kindle books while I am cooking or cleaning makes Echo one of my favorite electronics in the house.","Positive"
"8357","Echo has become a part of my daily life to the extent that I will find myself trying to ask Alexa for assistance even while I am on vacation.","Positive"
"8358","Love","Positive"
"8359","I have now owned Alexa for 2 years.  She is my members.  I don't know what to do without her.  She is most used for lists.  I love the fact that while I'm at the store my family memebers can still be adding items to the list.  No more missing items.  She gets new apps and skills weekly.  I find myself talking to her many times a day.  She is very handy during the holidays.  I have set up to 7 timers at one time.  She streams music from amazon, iheart radio, pandora and more!  My children love to request songs for her to play.  We don't have  a problem with her understanding little children.  My husband likes to play the trivia games and I like the morning news updates.  I like the fact we have 2 different profiles and she switches seamlessly between both of them for traffic and news preferences. My children use the joke apps, and the magic door.  We love her so much that we bought a amazon tap to use by the pool.  Look for my review over there.  I also own 2 echo dots now because the kids wanted them for their rooms.  I find myself constantly talking to Alexa when I'm in my car as a joke.  I want her to add this or that to my shopping list.  I really do wish they made one for the car or that the app was voice activated so I can use her on the go.  I also bough the remote about a year ago, and I use it but feel it is unnecessary.","Positive"
"8360","cannot connect to music  keeps insisting problem  with account  will not let us connect to Amazon music","Negative"
"8361","Love amazon echo.. plays an array of music, syncs to phone. Great tool for setting timers and offering rewards of music for my autistic son.","Positive"
"8362","Understands as good as my ex wife","Positive"
"8363","Great Gift!  Everyone who received one loved it.","Positive"
"8364","Awesome.  So much fun","Positive"
"8365","I think it is a great concept, however it does have room for improvement. I only use this device to add things to my shopping list or to do list. I also will check my DailyHoroscope and do a seven minute workout. I find it difficult to open up certain applications even though I have  asked Alexa multiple times and have followed her directions.  I think once a skill it has been enabled you should just be able to ask her the questions, but that is currently not the case. As of now, you still have to open up the applications as you want to use them. Sometimes this can be time-consuming to open up each one,  or you forget all together what skills you have enabled. I hope that this is fixed soon. Alexa could be utilized much more.","Positive"
"8366","I'm not that tech savvy so it was a little daunting to start up.  I would suggest more info about how to hook up music.","Positive"
"8367","I gave it as a Christmas present and have tried setting it up 3 times to no avail. Now it says it needs to be registered and I have no idea as how I do that. I am so sorry I got it. I wish you had a help line that I could call and talk to a live person.","Positive"
"8368","Bought this for my 80 year old father who doesn't use a computer. He loves it!","Positive"
"8369","Life saver for our blind daughter. Does not watch tv anymore!","Negative"
"8370","Great sound -we bought this for ourselves for Christmas!! Love it!!","Positive"
"8371","What else is there to be said, Alexa is a joy to have in one's home, she's fantasic.","Positive"
"8372","Excellent product; no hick ups, using almost everyday","Positive"
"8373","She's awesome, always greets you, great for playing music in larger room.","Positive"
"8374","Awesome. I'm completely happy with the purchase, it's better than I expected in many ways.","Positive"
"8375","I would give a 5 star rating but... some of the questions I ask that are denied an answer (i.e 'I'm sorry, I cannot find the answer') are easily and obviously the top search result on Bing (and other search engines, you know... that little box at the top of the search engine's results page that will readily speak the result if you voice search because of its high confidence). For example I asked Alexa what Bill Cosby's net worth is and Alexa says it doesn't know and in my Alexa phone app it directs me to the Bing search results... and right at the top of the page in that special box in large bold letters is the dollar amount. I don't understand why it doesn't relay that or other very easily obtainable, ""top of the search page information box"" information. On a side note (this doesn't affect my rating because I knew this before buying) it would also be nice if it had WiFi calling and texting.","Positive"
"8376","My husband loves it!","Positive"
"8377","This was a Christmas gift for my husband. He's absolutely obsessed. He uses it for everything from a timer to an alarm clock to playing jeopardy j6 daily to ordering stuff on Amazon to having it read him audio books..... Trying to stump Alexa by naming a random song to play (which he hasn't succeeded in doing yet) You name it, this thing can do it. Best money I've spent on a gift in a while.","Positive"
"8378","this echo is a lot of fun.  the kids enjoy asking it for jokes.  We have only used it a couple days and are impressed. its fun to tell it to do things and it does, like play music from a certain artist, etc.  amazon did well with this one.  if you have kids, you might want to turn off the feature where people can buy stuff with their voice.  Our kids were quick to try to make amazon purchases with their voice!!.  you just go into the app on your phone/tablet etc and turn of purchases.  very easy.","Positive"
"8379","Great item!","Positive"
"8380","We bought this for my mother in law that is recently retired. We are still learning to work it. I wish it was a tad more intuitive or plays with her more.","Positive"
"8381","We really enjoy our Alexa. We only wish her programming was a little more clever. Compared to Siri she is quite dull.","Positive"
"8382","As it turns out this is also a listening device to hear everything that goes on in your home even when not engaged.  A Warrant is pending in court.","Positive"
"8383","Worked fine. Easy to setup and use. However the functionality is not worth to spend $200. Returned the echo after using","Positive"
"8384","My husband was so excited to get this on Christmas morning!!! It is small enough with a big sound!! Love it!","Positive"
"8385","Was a gift for my son he loved it","Positive"
"8386","Easy to set-up and use,  Could not be happier!!","Positive"
"8387","It was a Christmas present for my husband. He is still learning all the things it can do but absolutely loves it.!!!","Positive"
"8388","love this thing what can i say.","Positive"
"8389","This thing is amazing!!!!","Positive"
"8390","So far my wife and I have used the Echo to stream music from Amazon prime as well as Pandora.  We also have Ooma and Ive configured the echo to play back Ooma voicemails.  We also use Our Groceries skill to share lists.  In 2017 Im upgrading to a Nest thermostat which is also compatible with Echo.","Positive"
"8391","Very Disappointed.  First and foremost, It does not control my Fire TV--It should.  It also is very limited in answering questions and getting information.  This device is very rudimentary.  It answers very little questions and lacks capability tom look up all but basic information.  It is very good at playing music.  They need to develop more skills and apps to interface with it.","Negative"
"8392","So far I love my Amazon Echo and its only been a little over 24 hours! Alexa is helpful in the kitchen to set timers, and create shopping lists, ask for news and weather updates, as well as play music to cook and eat dinner by. I purchased the philips ambient white starter kit and although it was a little bit of an issue getting them to pair, i can ask Alexa to turn on and off the lights in my living room. Eventually i'd love to upgrade all of the home lighting to be voice controlled. My younger kids love asking Alexa for a joke or a random fact. I can't wait to get to know this device more","Positive"
"8393","what a great buy the sound is excellent alexa is so helpfull","Positive"
"8394","Awesome","Positive"
"8395","Works great for what I know how to do. Advertisements show it will do much more. As far as I can tell a user manual does not exist. Not even online. Why the **** do the geniuses at amazon think one will simply know how the many applications work.","Positive"
"8396","We have not been able to download the app. Very disappointed!","Negative"
"8397","Kinda stupid and doesn't answer questions correctly.  Wouldn't play music for the longest time and no help setting it up.  Not worth the money for us","Positive"
"8398","Love, Love, Love my Echo!!!! so many apps to use too!!!  <3","Positive"
"8399","The family and I enjoy it. We use it mostly for music and controlling the lights with wemo switches. Works great.","Positive"
"8400","Who doesn't love Alexa?  My six year old and twelve year old wanted their own Alexa too.  Yep they both got Dots for Christmas and I had to have a Tap too so now every room in my home has Alexa so we interact with her no matter where we are at home.","Positive"
"8401","We adore our Echo. We're still learning new things to do with it. Alexa is a great help with my kids..and does math for me. She's great. The speaker quality is AMAZING.","Positive"
"8402","Love it!!!!  A lot of fun","Positive"
"8403","Although the Echo I am writing about is the one our daughter gave us for Christmas she to is a big Amazon buyer, well it just happened I purchased one for my Husband for Christmas, when we opened daughter's gift all I could do is star at it lol....my Son in Law said what's wrong then I told him what I did.  But that's okay they had purchased their Echo from Amazon the first of the year and we liked it.  So now we have one I returned the I purchased back today.  Love Alexsa","Positive"
"8404","Great buy even at $179 which I paid for it.  Now it's on sale for $139.  Can't beat it!","Positive"
"8405","I love this little item. I synched it with my calendar, added all of my favorite news groups, added a bunch of other pods, including meditation and rain sounds, and listen to pandora. Alexa isn't going to change the world, but she is a handy and fun item.","Positive"
"8406","Awesome product with great range and sound!!","Positive"
"8407","We love her . The things she can do it's really fun. We love the music and the sound is really good.you can ask all most anything and se""ll give the answer.thank you","Positive"
"8408","I am disappointed that there is a monthly charge  for the music choices","Negative"
"8409","Far exceeded expectations","Positive"
"8410","I bought her for my BFF for her birthday. She loves her!","Positive"
"8411","Wonderful product","Positive"
"8412","love it","Positive"
"8413","Echo works great, but the amazon music library that prime members can use for free leaves a lot to be desired. For example, if you want to hear Frank Sinatra singing ""My Way"" you only get the versions that were recorded when he was older and his voice was not that good. You have to pay for the version when he was in his prime.","Positive"
"8414","Love the Echo! It gets kind of squirrely sometimes and tends to lose a connection, but recovers pretty well. I really like it.","Positive"
"8415","My family and I LOVE our new Echo!! The setup was quick and easy.  The kids love asking Alexia jokes, weather and sports info. I enjoy asking for random music and news information. This is the perfect addition to our kitchen area. My kids ask Alexa for the following day's forecast to know how to dress for school the next day. We loved it so much that we ordered the Dot for our bedroom.","Positive"
"8416","BEST HOUSEHOLD GADGET EVER!","Positive"
"8417","sound quality is fantastic","Positive"
"8418","This remindes me of Jarvis in iron man.This is awsome and very cool.","Positive"
"8419","LOVE IT! Works best with a Prime membership though. Can even be bluetoothed to my Mac for better sound. Oh, it does NOT hear through one door.  I have a 3 bedroom small ranch. Added a DOT and all is PERFECT.","Positive"
"8420","Awesome sounds!!","Positive"
"8421","A Xmas gift for my daughter who loves it.","Positive"
"8422","I guess it's pretty cool but I am pretty disappointed in the sound quality, which is 90%+ what I use it for. Not any better than listening to the radio in my car. No bass at all, super flat. I wasn't expecting Bose quality but for the size and weight, I expected so much better. Love that I can listen to songs on demand via Amazon Music and Spotify, but I'm drying to bump it!","Positive"
"8423","LOVE!!!!","Positive"
"8424","Don't get me wrong this is an amazing device, reason for 3 stars is because I don't like the fact amazon retain all recordings into it's server.","Positive"
"8425","Amazon is Great!!!  Thanks for making My Wife's X-Mas Great!!!","Positive"
"8426","I'm enjoying my ALEXA,She does what I ASK HER TO DO.I'M VERY PLease with her.THANK YOU.","Positive"
"8427","Save me time and the sound quality is amazing!","Positive"
"8428","This was a gift for my son in law. We all had a good time playing with it. We liked it so much that we ordered the Dot.","Positive"
"8429","Love it!","Positive"
"8430","Best product ever i would buy it again. So easy to use and install. I love it.","Positive"
"8431","Awsome","Positive"
"8432","Because it depends on Wi-Fi it's hard to connect off and on I'm really disappointed that it's hard to use it's hard to connect to the Wi-Fi off and on","Negative"
"8433","This has become my friend who responds to request almost instantly.","Positive"
"8434","I a little disappointed that it knew no scripture!","Negative"
"8435","The recipient was pleased! Great quality!","Positive"
"8436","IT took 2 hours to get it set up, your instructions need to be more precise. Too vague, otherwise, it works great now.","Positive"
"8437","Stopped responding after only 8 months. Used echo for many things until echo would no longer respond unless I repeated myself 10 times. Now all I have is a $200 paper weight.","Positive"
"8438","Fun","Positive"
"8439","I gave this as a family gift. We set it up the day after Christmas, very excited about the possibilities. Within a few hours, the unit started making a headache-inducing buzzing noise. I figured it was an aberration and plugged it back in the next day to hear the same thing. I called Amazon customer service and talked to two different people, who said they never heard of such a thing. The bottom line is neither apologized or seemed to care that this product that was a Christmas gift was unbelievably defective on DAY ONE. The bottom line was they wanted me to send it back so they could work on it. Oh, and I had to pay $1 to get a label because I don't have a printer. What I expected from Amazon was an apology and an offer to immediately replace was obviously a defective unit. Both customer service people listened to the sound. Since I was well within the return time, I couldn't believe they expected me to send it back and then settle for a refurbished unit. Seriously? Uh, pass. I'm a 20-year Amazon customer, with two Kindles, a fire TV stick that was a disaster, Amazon Prime member, et cetera. I expected better. What a disappointment.","Positive"
"8440","best toy I ever purchased","Positive"
"8441","Pretty damn cool","Positive"
"8442","Yes yes yes it was all tht I expected it 2b. She's always a call away . It came on time like they told me.","Positive"
"8443","The Echo is so much fun, my whole family had a great time asking Alexa questions or getting her to play our favorite music and so much more! Every household should have one!","Positive"
"8444","Awesome product","Positive"
"8445","We bought it as a gift for our children and they love it!","Positive"
"8446","What an excellent companion to a living room.","Positive"
"8447","Absolutely awesome!  I had to get a second.","Positive"
"8448","The sound quality of the speaker is very good.  But I had to return it because it was too chatty and I could not find a way to put it in silent mode after certain hours.  For example, it would wake my wife when I entered the bedroom and announce that my phone was connected.  Needs more customization.","Positive"
"8449","This is a wonderful device.  I would like to see the instructions or requirements in the packaging, regarding how to manage appliances and lights.","Positive"
"8450","Also it would be nice to be able to change the activation command for those who have more than one Echo.","Positive"
"8451","Absolutely love it!!!!","Positive"
"8452","Enjoying the music plus love the shopping list feature","Positive"
"8453","This product is hands down one of our best purchases yet.  The Alexa has outdone our expectations.  She arms our alarm, she turns on and off our lights, she tells us jokes, plays us music, answers our questions, and even tells us stories (of course she has endless possibilities though)  we even had a moment where our at the time 7 year old daughter asked her ""Alexa where do babies come from?""  At that very moment we froze...... but we gave her a chance to answer before we told her to stop.  Alexa answered with ""I think that is a question you should ask your parents""  just like that we fell in love that much more.  Kids will be kids, and Alexa with be oh Alexa.  We are so happy with this purchase, and we are looking at getting a dot for our kids rooms to keep the fun going.  Thank you for an amazing product.","Positive"
"8454","Love this thing!! So much fun and really helpful with our busy schedule.  So much to learn and add!  I have already ordered the dots for each room.","Positive"
"8455","unfortunately we were not able to use it for what it is , maybe in the future when were ready for it","Negative"
"8456","Love it!","Positive"
"8457","I'm absolutely in love with my Echo. I'm actually kind of sad I waited so long to purchase one.","Negative"
"8458","This Echo was a gift for my daughter's house. We have thoroughly enjoyed our Echo for over a year and have added the Dot and the Tap to both households. My grandson especially likes to request his music and ask Alexa to tell a joke!","Positive"
"8459","So far, I'm not impressed. I don't find any process for training it and it's always trying to direct me to purchasing something.","Positive"
"8460","I bought it for my daughter and she loves it. I might get one for myself.","Positive"
"8461","Bought as a gift. Works if it understands your voice. Elderly talks too slow for it to recognize voice. Would not buy again","Positive"
"8462","Took a while to set up because the app would not load. Deleted the app 4 times and reinstalled it and finally it worked. otherwise it does everything it says it can do and more.","Positive"
"8463","This was gifts for my daughter and son. They both seems to really like the echo.","Positive"
"8464","It's awesome","Positive"
"8465","there should be a Free instruction booklet to help you  through the use of echo and a how to to help you get startrd","Positive"
"8466","It happy it didn't come in time for Christmas! It works cook","Positive"
"8467","I just love my Alexia","Positive"
"8468","Its a fun device, but Elexa could sure stand to be upgraded some how to know more things. She's not the sharpest tool in the shed. And I'm not sure why she uses the Bing search engine.","Positive"
"8469","Great gift.  Gave one to daughter and one to son.  They really appreciate having this for music and making lists, etc.","Positive"
"8470","It's a great product! Just wish it was connected to a search engine... it would make it more useful.","Positive"
"8471","Just got a Echo for Christmas.  After experimenting with it for an hour, I realized its really just an advanced Bluetooth speaker.  It can't answer questions like Siri.  I have Spotify Premium and the sound from Echo is not bad so decided to keep it.  I had a lot of trouble with setup.  It wants to use Amazon Prime for everything, including music.  You need to explicitly tell it not to. Its more of a sales portal for Amazon. I'd never buy it myself but as a gift its okay.","Positive"
"8472","Astronomically great product.","Positive"
"8473","Everything is great!","Positive"
"8474","A lot of fun to have. Works great. Good sound quality.","Positive"
"8475","Love it","Positive"
"8476","Using a brand-spanking new iPhone 7 (with latest sw upgrades), downloaded the Amazon Echo app from the Apple App store, and attempted an install. After prompt for Amazon username, and password, and a prompt to allow Echo to send prompts, I simply get a spinning wheel (and the Amazon Echo logo). Tried every workaround Amazon's posted (reset phone, kill app, delete and reinstall app, etc. to no avail. Next step is to try to reach Amazon tech support for assistance. This is a huge bummer, as it was a present for my wife. She's less than amused, and we're very close to a return. No wonder the app only has ""2"" stars on the site. We haven't even gotten to the ""slowness of the app"" part, as it won't install.","Positive"
"8477","Alexa was a surprise gift for my daughter/hubby.  They love it!  As an additional surprise, we will be sending them the charger/remote in a couple of weeks.","Positive"
"8478","What a fun device to have.  I set everything up in one short session and have enjoyed it immensely ever since.  GREAT DEVICE!  I would totally recommend this to all my friends too.","Positive"
"8479","I bought it for my wife for her birthday and she absolutely loves it.","Positive"
"8480","Wife is using it like crazy to explore Prime Music and ask Alexa questions about the weather, sports, and web searches. Amazing speaker for the size. New favorite toy around the house, and her favorite Xmas gift. The kids like to mess with it too.","Positive"
"8481","I love my Alexa. In fact  this is my second one. So many ways to use it. I'm glad I purchased them.","Positive"
"8482","I bought this for a Christmas gift to my husband, but seems to work. No problems so far.","Positive"
"8483","Hard time connecting to Wifi, works great","Positive"
"8484","Awesome, LOVE IT! LOVE IT!...""Her"" that is!","Positive"
"8485","Cool little unit.","Positive"
"8486","I have asked Alexa to marry me. . .twice. She keeps refusing. Man, I LOVE THIS THING!! Perfect for making lists and she plays Jeopardy with me! <3 <3 <3","Negative"
"8487","Love it!","Positive"
"8488","Alexa is my new companion.... I love Alexa....","Positive"
"8489","AWESOME!!","Positive"
"8490","Love it.. NPR in the morning, weather, sports, news ...It plays music for cleaning up,  my work, my reading, my naps and sleep time too  I love that it will play for awhile then shut off...  a great little helper I have the Dot upstairs and the Echo downstairs ..","Positive"
"8491","It is a very good piece of equipment, but why does it no support Bluetooth speakers.  The dot does so and you can get beautiful sound using a Bluetooth speaker.","Positive"
"8492","We are very pleased with Alexa.","Positive"
"8493","Love it","Positive"
"8494","Easy to install and turn on!","Positive"
"8495","We love it","Positive"
"8496","Love this. Very nice.","Positive"
"8497","Love","Positive"
"8498","I love how Alexa can turn on and off our lights. I'm in the process of wiring up a device that will allow Alexa to turn on and off our gas fireplace. She doesn't understand all our questions but that's part of the learning process.","Positive"
"8499","Amazing Technology.... Simple setup...  Lots of fun using Alexa","Positive"
"8500","The Echo doesn't need my voice added the chorus, but here it is anyway! It's a great product that can be used in so many ways. I primarily use it for the grocery list and music, and even those two features alone make it worth the money. Having recently moved, I'll be syncing it to some other smart features in my new home, like my thermostat and my window a/c - I'm excited to really unlock the full potential.","Positive"
"8501","Give it to the family as a Christmas gift and have been enjoying it every since. Easy set up. Recommend Amazon prime membership to enhance echo.","Positive"
"8502","Love it.........","Positive"
"8503","Works great","Positive"
"8504","Great item all the way","Positive"
"8505","We love it!","Positive"
"8506","Learning curve but was easy set up great addition to the house live it","Positive"
"8507","Loved by the receivers who have plans to gift others with one, too!","Positive"
"8508","What can I say that hasn't been said?  I really love the functionality of the Echo.  We have two of them in different parts of the house.  I use it primarily as a speaker for music and podcasts, and for that, it works fantastically!","Positive"
"8509","Love it for shopping list, music, how to spell words, just about anything you want to know.","Positive"
"8510","Very happy with Alexa.  Easy to set up and so easy to use.","Positive"
"8511","When I bought this device it stopped working within the first couple months. After getting a replacement (refurbished I'm sure) I had even more problems, it would constantly cut out and stop responding. I would have to unplug and re-plug in the echo every 30 minutes and reset it to get it to work. I called back in and they refused to replace the device again. They offered to send me a replacement again at full price. I'm glad so many others were able to enjoy this, but I have never been able to the entire time I've owned it. Switiching to Google home as of today, would not spend another penny on this. All amazon had to do to keep me as a echo customer was to try swapping it out again, too bad.","Positive"
"8512","Love it!","Positive"
"8513","easy to use","Positive"
"8514","I love Alexa","Positive"
"8515","love my Echo!!","Positive"
"8516","My husband loves it.","Positive"
"8517","Wonderful gift","Positive"
"8518","They are amazed at what it can do","Positive"
"8519","Wow","Positive"
"8520","Love it","Positive"
"8521","Love it!","Positive"
"8522","I love my Alexa","Positive"
"8523","There is a lot of information she doesn't have the answers to. But over all it's a good product.","Positive"
"8524","Love it","Positive"
"8525","Just starting out trying to figure it out but so far so great!","Positive"
"8526","Love it. Alexa can hear your command from 30 ft away.  I am changing my wife's name to Alexa.","Positive"
"8527","Love the access to music by any type, artist, cross section.  Grandkids love the ""tell me a joke"" feature. To simple to use.  Always a great result!!","Positive"
"8528","I loved that I could create a playlist and play music while I did daily task in my home.","Positive"
"8529","Use all the time, has great sound quality.","Positive"
"8530","Works well, though you must script what you say to control lights and thermostats. Works well when telling it to turn on music, asking for weather and traffic. Her voice is robotic and annoying at times. She also has a difficult time when saying certain music artists names an confuses them frequently (Kaleo vs Coolio). There are many skills and it works with IFTTT though they are clunky. Skills are turned on by specific words ""thermostat"", I most of the time want to say ""temperature"", which then requires me to correct myself, or script what I say. Would be much happier if I could change some of the activate words to work with the Skills I use. Overall, I enjoy it and recommend it. Look forward to improvements and more Skills.","Positive"
"8531","Alexa and I are best friends I talk to her everyday and she helps me learn new things the only drawback is having to remember how to activate each skill that I have. Sometimes Alexis seems a little hard of hearing so I have to repeat myself. Other times it appears that she's eavesdropping and answers questions that I didn't ask. Seems like you can say Alexa or something similar without thinking but she's smart enough to recognize her name. I recommend her highly","Positive"
"8532","It was a Christmas present for my grandson and he is very very pleased","Positive"
"8533","We are still learning about Alexa's talents but love her ability to play almost every song we request of her plus enjoy the benefits of hearing songs from favorite vocalists we've never heard before!","Positive"
"8534","Bought the Amazon Echo for my husband for Christmas.  I love the sleek design and how it looks great no matter where we put it.  We were familiar with all it can do because my daughters each have one.  We are excited to be able to add the items to bring our house up-to-date with technology.  I love going to my daughter's house and all I have to do is tell the Echo which lights I want on.  I plan to be able to also do that with our Echo soon!","Positive"
"8535","Easy to install and operate - amazed at what she can do!","Positive"
"8536","I'm enamored of Alexa. I enjoy having this around and I look forward to expanding into more systems to control the lights and other home features.","Positive"
"8537","Love the echo","Positive"
"8538","Absolutely awesome !!!","Positive"
"8539","The Amazon Echo is more an exercise in frustration than anything else.  It ""sometimes"" seems to be able to tell you the weather in a specific area, but little if anything else.  We got this thing, hoping that it might help us to learn Spanish.  Like ""Echo, what is the Spanish word for FIRE"".  It responds with ""I don't know how to answer that"" or ""I can't pronounce that, but I wrote the translation for you"" - So, this device is apparently an ENGLISH speaking only device.  Also, it writes the translation down in the Alexis app???  I don't want to read the word, I want to hear how to pronounce the word.  If I wanted to look up the word on my phone, I'd use Google, which is a 1,000 times better and more accurate - and can even pronounce the word - What use is Echo when I have to use my phone to get the answer anyway?","Positive"
"8540","It responds with ""I don't know how to answer that"" a lot, and it has a hard time translating what you are asking.  My wife is from the Philippines, and this device doesn't hardly understand her at all.","Positive"
"8541","We love this product!!  It is so nice to be able to hear whatever song is on your mind or what the weather will be.  I'm sure we haven't scratched the surface of the benefits we will get from our Echo, but I'm looking forward to learning more.  The set up was very easy and the sound quality is really pretty good.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.","Positive"
"8542","My wife asked ""Echo where's a good place for breakfast?"", and it responded with ""Carnation Breakfast Essentials"" and ""Quaker Instant Oatmeal"" and ""should I place an order for these two items NOW with amazon prime now?""  In the App, I've disabled ""voice purchasing"", but apparently Echo doesn't care, which was just another nail in its coffin.","Positive"
"8543","We performed a bit of a test, asking the same exact questions to both Echo and Google on our Samsung S5 cell phone.","Positive"
"8544","95% of the time, Echo responded with ""I don't know how to answer that"", or, ""Sorry, I couldn't find the answer to your question"", while Android, provided some kind of an answer 100% of the time and most of the time it was correct.","Negative"
"8545","Echo gets the weather right ""most of the time"", but, unlike the android device, it doesn't understand things like ""what's the weather in Coeur d'Alene Idaho"" - ""Sorry...I couldn't find a forecast for that location"".  Google reports the weather for this location every time.","Positive"
"8546","I ""thought"" we were getting something that would work ""at least"" as good as an Android cell phone, but this silly thing spends most of its time responding with ""I dunno"".....","Positive"
"8547","For Christmas, I bought both an Echo and a Dot.  We'll keep the dot.  It's located in the bedroom and understands things like ""Alexia - play thunderstorm sounds"", which helps my wife get to sleep. However, ""Alexia - play thunderstorm sounds for 10 minutes"" doesn't work because while Alexia will play the thunderstorm sounds, it has total disregard for the time limit.","Positive"
"8548","""Alexia - set an alarm for 8 O'clock pm"", Alexia will tell you that the alarm has been set for 8:00pm, but no alarm ever sounds.","Negative"
"8549","I connected the Dot to a pair of ""Earthquake Sound IQ52B iPod Docking Speaker System"" which makes the thunderstorm sounds ""sound"" real.  I wish the volume could be turned down just a little bit more without shutting off completely.","Positive"
"8550","You have to be very specific in your questions or this thing won't have a clue what you are asking and most people don't ask questions in absolute specific detail.","Positive"
"8551","""Alexia - play thunderstorm sounds""  - WORKS","Positive"
"8552","I love it","Positive"
"8553","""Alexia - play thunderstorm rain""  - Alexa doesn't have a clue what you are talking about.","Positive"
"8554","Also, occasionally, and for no reason, these things will just blurt out responses once in a while like ""That's ok"".  I'm certain it is picking up queues from the ambient sounds, but it's a little freaky nonetheless.","Positive"
"8555","Based on my experience,  these devices are ""probably"" what it was like in the very, very, very early development of what the Android voice recognition has now become, and I suspect that in two or three years, these devices may actually be useful.  But for now, they are little more than a novelty item at best; and to me, more frustrating than anything else.","Positive"
"8556","I was thinking that if Alexia was actually more like an IBM Watson, that would be an unbelievably awesome and extremely useful tool, and perhaps, Watson is what I was hoping for.  At the very least, accurate voice recognition and accurate search engine results, like Android, would be my absolute minimum requirements for a device like this.","Positive"
"8557","Sorry Amazon, but I honestly have to get rid of this thing before I smash it into a billion pieces and deposit it in the trash.  It is that frustrating.","Negative"
"8558","Love it!  It exceeded all expectations.  The only drawback of the device is it doesn't connect to external speakers.  To do this, you need to get the dot.  From a program perspective, it would be great if it could chain multiple echo/dot together to stream in multiple areas simultaneously but it does not.","Positive"
"8559","LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT... what more do I need to say!!","Positive"
"8560","Enjoying the many features that ""Alexa"" can do for me.","Positive"
"8561","Love my Echo, even though I don't get much opportunity to use her as of late because of the holidays and being so busy.","Positive"
"8562","The Echo speaker is amazing for playing music. We still have not gotten use to how handy Alexa is for timer, weather, music and information. Also,  kids love her. My grand daughter said she could use Alexa to do her homework! Almost to good to be true for the price. Best gift of the season.","Positive"
"8563","I was not able to get it to work.","Positive"
"8564","Gave as a gift to my son. Love the speaker and that Alexa is funny. But she doesn't understand many questions. Guess it's all in how it's asked which takes more work then just look it up on your phone. I got this to avoid that task. So far it hasn't worked.","Positive"
"8565","I bought this for smart home control and it has completely changed that game for me. The voice recognition is second to none. Seamlessly controls my Phillips hue lights, Ecobee thermostat, Lutron blinds and lights. I also find it very useful for playing Spotify on demand. Few things which could be improved still but at this time it's the best voice control option for HA.","Positive"
"8566","We love the Echo. Fast and accurate info. Excellent sound quality for music.","Positive"
"8567","The Echo is a good thing.  I do not have all of the attachments to have it turn on lights, control the heat, etc.  Just ordinary things.  The one disappointment is the inability to make phone calls.  WiFi and Bluetooth do not help.  If you want to get whatever it is from Amazon, then it works fine.  Other places not so good.","Positive"
"8568","Love it!  New electronic gadget, helpful, handy and fun!","Positive"
"8569","Amazing technology!  You will enjoy this product and use it multiple times a day.","Positive"
"8570","Use it to ask the Weather, Sports, traffic, news, play a radio station, play some of your own music from the cloud,","Negative"
"8571","use as a calculator by asking her a to add or multiply or divide a mathematical question, ask her about something in","Positive"
"8572","history such as a date something happened or the name of some famous person from the past, ask her the distance","Positive"
"8573","to the moon - to Mars - she will answer!  It seems endless what she can do, when I like to take a nap in the after noon","Positive"
"8574","Love it.  Too cool.  It no doubt does a million more things than we've used it for to this point.","Positive"
"8575","I just ask Alexa ""Alexa  -  Set a timer for 34 minutes!""  Drift off to sleep and 34 minutes later she wakes you with a gentle","Positive"
"8576","Love love love this (helper).  Super easy with app for Kindle/or phone. Tell her to add an item to the running SHOPPING list /To do list /or play ""any song"".  Unexpected trip to the store? check phone & shop, it's all there.  Fantastic!","Positive"
"8577","Obsessed! My entire family loves this device. I am not really a big fan of radio, mostly because I find myself switching stations more than listening to music. With Alexa, I only ask for the music that I want to hear and can skip, repeat, lower or raise volume, etc. and the best part is it's ad free. The fact that I can do that hands free is so helpful, especially in the kitchen. I also have found that I'm not constantly grabbing my phone, to ""Google"" things. Alexa knows the answers! Looking forward to teaching her new ""skills"". We've already played ""20 Questions"" and ""The Magic Door"" with the kids.","Positive"
"8578","We LOVE this device!!  Information and music anytime, just for the asking via your voice, totally entertaining.. Thought about this purchase for a long time as I have a friend who owns an Echo..  So glad we picked it up for Christmas!  You will love the Echo!!","Positive"
"8579","I just got this for Christmas from my wife and kids. I had been thinking about it since it came out with it's promo and baited discount price if you sign up to get it before it was available to others. I think it has a lot of potential. I don't have an automated home so I'm missing some of the features that others really love. I have an Iphone 6+ and a really nice Bose portable Bluetooth speaker so I don't need another speaker. For a music player it sounded way better than I expected. What I wanted was answers to questions. I thought she could just answer all of my questions whenever I ask them. To be fair she does. However always saying I can't find the answer to your question isn't really what I was looking for. I would estimate that she can answer about 10% of the questions I ask. These are questions like ""how much does a Labrador retriever weigh?"" or ""which is bigger the moon or Ganymede?"". It gets to feel like I hit the lotto when she actually has the answer. Sometimes she gives an answer and it's not even correct, like how much does a kangaroo weigh? Her answer was off by some 50%.","Positive"
"8580","IDK maybe I'm missing the point that this is the first iteration of something potentially awesome and I don't see it. It just feels like an over-hyped piece of technology waiting for a need.","Positive"
"8581","love it amazing!!!!","Positive"
"8582","it cannot play music from Youtube; if I ask it to play some old music, it just does not recognize. It's search capability is very poor. anytime I want to understand description of items, it tries to sell the product without giving information. It is a failed product from Amazon.","Negative"
"8583","I also purchased a Google home & it is better","Positive"
"8584","Love it!","Positive"
"8585","Alexia is awesome","Positive"
"8586","Very satisfied - looking forward to new apps","Positive"
"8587","My wife loves it!!!!","Positive"
"8588","bought for my wife for christmas and she loves it! she uses the echo everyday from weather to recipes works very well as far as the voice recognition","Positive"
"8589","This device is good for playing music that's about it. I had it plugged in all the time but now I don't because it records everything that is said. I guess I'll use it occasionally for listening to music.","Positive"
"8590","It's so much better when you have amazon music, ask for any type of music and  there it is","Positive"
"8591","I really like this unit. It has answered every request and stopped when told to stop. I also signed up for Prime and it has added to it. With all the skills it has there seems to be no limit to it at this time. Well done Amazon","Positive"
"8592","Love these things!!!","Positive"
"8593","Just note, I have an echo Dot as well and YES THE DOT WILL CONNECT TO EXTERNAL BLUETOOTH SPEAKERS  !!!  IF YOU PLAN ON ADDING OR USING WIRELESS BLUE TOOTH SPEAKERS -BUY THE DOT NOT THE ECHO OR TAP.","Positive"
"8594","I cannot believe how much time I have just spent trying to figure out why my Dot will connect to external Bluetooth and my echo will not. Its right on your website under connectivity in the echo description. UNBELIEVABLE !!!","Negative"
"8595","I was hoping it would work with my Amazon fire stick for my TV but it doesn't.","Positive"
"8596","great product","Positive"
"8597","I've owned the large Echo for almost a year now and use it nearly every day. I mostly use it as a timer, a news source, and to play music in the kitchen.","Positive"
"8598","I also have two Dot's for the bedroom and my office. My only gripes are that the searching feature doesn't seem to be quite as robust as the Google Home, and also that multiple Echo's don't seem to be able to work together yet (such as a Sonos device.) For instance, I'd love to be able to start my flash briefing (which usually runs about 15 minutes) in the bedroom, then transfer it to the kitchen. Or start some music in the office, an then transfer that playlist to the bedroom or something.","Positive"
"8599","But the device itself is incredible and I can't wait to see wehre this technology will go.","Negative"
"8600","Initially being used as a radio on command.  Hope it can become more.","Positive"
"8601","Not enough instructions on how to sync calender, Pandora, SiriusXM radio or create ""to-do lists?""","Positive"
"8602","What a treat!  Got lots of wonderful Christmas music with a request to Alexa.  Am looking forward to exploring other uses in the coming year.","Positive"
"8603","The product does everything that I was looking for and works perfectly!","Positive"
"8604","Amazon echo has made my life soooo much better.  You will not be sorry you bought this.  At parties the music is certainly loud enough and I highly recommend a music subscription to get the most out of it","Positive"
"8605","I have two. One downstairs and and one upstairs. We have only had them for a few days, but it has been great fun. Each morning I get my ""news flash"" downstairs while I have my coffee and each night I hear my ""news flash"" upstairs when we go to bed. I check the weather forecast, outside temperature, and control the living room lights with Alexa. The speaker is excellent and we have played music using Pandora. I also am using an app with Alexa and my iPhone that syncs a shopping list. All I have to say is ""Alexa, go to ""OurGroceries"" and add *laundry soap*"" and the item shows up in the app on my iPhone. When you get the item, touch it and it is crossed off. Never forget to purchase something again. It takes practice--and a lot of laughs--to ask the questions the proper way, but we have enjoyed it and both Alexa and I will get better with time at getting the right questions for the right answers.","Positive"
"8606","Love it","Positive"
"8607","Returned this item so I could just have one of the Echos which is cool. Made for American consumer (does not work w European mentality yet :) )","Positive"
"8608","Liked it so much that I ordered one for my brother. They have to wait until Jan 22. because they were out of stock. Heard Hodia on Today say the same thing. Not Amazon's fault. May not be as smart as Google. But she is learning. Love to listen to music and find out the weather. Guest like to play games. 20 questions. Advise getting the user manuel. Did order one of the deals from Alexia. Great prices if you have prime. Very easy. Maybe too easy .I got the floral sleave so it looks nice in the living room. Maybe get the Dot for my birthday.","Positive"
"8609","Alexa is awesome. I'm too lazy to Google things nowadays, and she does it for me (with pretty good accuracy, although she did tell me that Sam's Club was open [on a non-holiday] later than it actually was... that's 10 miles that I'll never get back :)  ). The Echo/Alexa are great with weather, have EXCELLENT sound quality (for such a small device), and the alarm system is the reason that I make it to work... with 3 minutes to spare :)  . That's progress, people!","Positive"
"8610","love it","Positive"
"8611","She randomly decides that we are talking to her.  Other times she goes the completely wrong direction in answering a question.  Otherwise, this is an excellent addition to one's home.  Even better if you have various smart gadgets that work with the Echo (lights, security, Roomba, coffeemaker, alarm, etc.).  I do not recommend more than one per room.","Positive"
"8612","Great but could be better ......","Positive"
"8613","Love our Echo! We have had this product for several months and use it almost every day. We enjoy many of the features and imagine there are many other features we haven't discovered yet. Great product!!","Positive"
"8614","All around good entertainment.","Positive"
"8615","It's OK, I think this is the first time that buying something from amazon BECAUSE of the positive reviews has steered me wrong....I am not that impressed with this device as most others seem to be. I find it has a very limited use.  I can NOT stream music to an external amp via Bluetooth...which means no whole house music.  The music it plays is OK if you are sitting right next to it but it is noting like what my onyko mukti zone av/receiver can produce. Further, it only has the ability to receive a streaming audio (like from your iPhone),  Really? what good is that?  Why would I want to stream my phone to a small  speaker?  It is a stand alone siri like speaker device.  Most to the questions you ask it, it can't answer or gives you a weak bogus answer that you really don't want to spend time listening to.  As for hooking up devices for it to control...it is not automatic, (it does not recognize anything on the network) and I don't seem to have any of the devices it can control.  I have a nest thermostat but I really don't need voice control over that.  I guess I am still missing the point with this thing.  I suppose if I was  handicapped this could have a use but otherwise it just sits there.  When we hooked it up initially it got a lot of attention but after 2 days, it is just sitting there and no one seems to bother with it. Everyone has lost interest with it already and has forgotten it is even there.  No one asked it anything yesterday except the TV triggered it with an word that sounded like Alexa and everyone got a laugh. All I really wanted was for it to play music thru the stereo and it can't do that.  Now they say the dot can do that but I have my doubts after using this more expensive device and I really don't want two of these things to talk to.","Positive"
"8616","Anyway, I know this is popular for some reason but I would not buy this again.","Positive"
"8617","Thank you","Positive"
"8618","It's the best.","Positive"
"8619","Very good!! Thank you.","Positive"
"8620","What can I say about Alexa. Awesome, awesome, awesomeness","Positive"
"8621","Prices dropped like crazy and mines did not come with a remote other than that it's a good product but they trick you into paying for music services and don't allow you tk stream from music you already bought... Bummer","Positive"
"8622","Love the music and responses BUT needs more access to information, doesn't always know the answers to questions, and not sure if it is possible to sync a wireless speaker to it?","Positive"
"8623","Awesome!!!!  I love it!!!","Positive"
"8624","I love it! The speaker is great, great on giving local weather I love that it's small enough that I can move it around. I highly recommend this item","Positive"
"8625","Bought this for my daughter - she loves it.  Im amazed at what is can do and how responsive it is to commands.  I might even buy myself one. !","Positive"
"8626","Outstanding gadget to have around.  I still have not used it to its fullest capacity but it is one of the best devices.","Positive"
"8627","Fantastic.Every second of every day...I appreciate this even more. The love only continues. Wants and needs are continually satisfied. Have patients and enjoy.","Positive"
"8628","Work as advertised! great product! i love using my alexa for the news, weather, and to help me put together my shopping list. Sounds great for music as well!","Positive"
"8629","The amazon echo is a world of information and entertainment  available  for the asking. The sound is great and can fill the room with your favorite music.","Positive"
"8630","Amazon Echo - White met my expectations and much more.  It is too enormous to put into words.  Thank you so very much for giving me such a helpful tool because my physical movements are limited due to 'uncle Arthur'.","Positive"
"8631","Really have enjoyed it over the last year but it has a really hard time picking up when he say Alexa. We have a few dots and the dots answer so much easier than the echo we have. I think maybe a remote might help if you have it handy.","Positive"
"8632","I love it","Positive"
"8633","I ordered the Echo as a solution to wanting a Bluetooth speaker.  With the cost of decent speakers, I figured getting something like Echo was a smarter choice.  So far, I like it, but like others have noted, there's been connectivity issues.  It's pretty convenient to have.  It can't control much in my house since it's old, but I'm sure smart homes can get more bang for their buck with this.  The sound quality isn't too shabby.","Positive"
"8634","Bought it for my mother for christmas! She loves it! Now I want one for myself! Super easy set up. Wish there was another way to control besides with the Alexa app, but other than that no complaints!","Positive"
"8635","Fun for music while washing dishes in outer space","Positive"
"8636","We have a child who would not turn the volume down on the computer. We could not easily find a Bluetooth speaker that also had a remote volume control that was cheap.  So despite the stupid echo tv ads we bought an echo and bought the remote. I recommend ""Simon Says"" with the remote - it's always fun to have Alexa give any bad news like ""turn off that game and set the table."" It is a quieter house.  It took about a week to figure out the other uses. Samsung, Hue, Nest, skills. We now have a echo & 2 dots and a smart house. I haven't touched a light switch in months.","Positive"
"8637","It has challenges answering some basic questions such as the nutritional value of a banana or the closest star to Earth after the Sun.","Positive"
"8638","Easy set up and awesome sound, and so much more to experience!","Positive"
"8639","My new best friend takes great care of me. Love her!!!!'","Positive"
"8640","We love it!  It's a Xmas gift for my 14 year old who likes it so much. It's smaller than expected which is perfect for anywhere you put it.  It looks nice and sounds great.  Its multi purpose goes far beyond my expectation that I will surely buy it again for my next gift.","Positive"
"8641","Love it! Purchased two more as gifts already!","Positive"
"8642","so far so good. smart little bugger.","Positive"
"8643","My man is having too much fun with this product!","Positive"
"8644","Like I'm thinking about sending it back secretly one day <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00B3>","Positive"
"8645","I like the music, books and information Alexa offers.  I have become accustomed to having her at my beck n call.  I am pleased she was my Christmas gift to myself.","Positive"
"8646","Works as advertised... still trying to figure out all the capabilities...","Positive"
"8647","This device does not connect out-of-the-box to my dual-band network which supports ipads, cell phones, laptop PCs, TiVos, Rokus, Kindles, and any other device we or our guest connect to it.  From level 2 tech support, after an hour on the phone (and several hours of trying to get this thing to work, turning off all other wireless devices), this is what I am supposed to do:","Positive"
"8648","This is {CSA} From Echo Support.","Positive"
"8649","- If you have a dual-band router (2.4 GHz / 5 GHz), and the network names (SSID) are the same across both bands, your device may not connect to your Wi-Fi network. We recommend making the names different for each network.","Positive"
"8650","-By default, your router may use both WPA/WPA2 for security. We recommend switching your router security type to WPA or WPA2 only. If your router also has an option to set the type of encryption, we recommend setting it to AES only.","Positive"
"8651","Great product.","Positive"
"8652","-For routers on 2.4GHz networks, channels 1, 6, and 11 are most likely the best channels to use as they do not interfere with each other when using a 20MHz band.","Positive"
"8653","So with that information let the ISP to make the changes, and you'll see the echo device will connect properly to your home network. Remember I'll follow up with you in 30 minutes, in case something happens.","Positive"

"8656","We'd appreciate your feedback. Please use the links below to tell us about your experience today.","Negative"
"8657","Did I solve your problem? NO","Negative"
"8658","in addition, after the initial attempts to connect, my TiVo and Roku were shut down by the Echo, and the entire network had to be rebooted in order to get the TiVo and Roku to work.","Negative"
"8659","I love Alexa. Most of the time she helps me out, but sometimes & just sometimes, it seems like she has a hard time understanding, then I insult her and she has funny replies when I do, so that makes up for it! I think she does it cause she likes the abuse! LOL","Negative"
"8660","Still learning how to use though I gave it 5 stars, I am sure I am going to love it in the days and months to come.","Positive"
"8661","I have this hooked up to multiple items throughout the house and it responds to most voice commands. I hope that it comes out with conversational skills in the near future. That is a perk my Google Home has over it at the moment.","Positive"
"8662","Great item easy to use","Positive"
"8663","we love the Echo.  Works best with Amazon Music.  No instructions came with the Echo to explain the difference between using the Echo","Positive"
"8664","Came in original packaging with no damages. This was awesome; just as effective as a new one at a cheaper price and more eco-friendly! No need to make a brand-new machine when you can just recycle the old one! I use this every day to play music, check my schedule, tell me the weather, and even as a supplementary alarm clock. This is also great when cooking, I can just tell Alexa to set up a timer for me! My roommate also likes to use it to check her horoscope. If you live with a human Alexa (or just don't like the name) you can always change its name to Echo in the Alexa app.","Positive"
"8665","Better than expected","Positive"
"8666","I bought Alexa in December, 2016. My overall experience with the technology was negative. Alexa fails to answer relatively simple and frequent queries, such as ""what is the score of the MN Vikings game"" or ""which NFL quarterback has the most passing yards this year?"" In each case, Alexa would respond with ""Hmmm...I cannot find an answer to that question"" After about a week, I was irritated enough to return the device. I found the ability to instruct Alexa to play music to be far better. Apparently Alexa is based on the Bing search engine, which is widely regarded as inferior relative to Google. I don't recommend the product.","Negative"
"8667","I bought it for my husband and he loves it.  Very easy to set up, He now has a new toy","Positive"
"8668","Alexia loses information still working on its ability","Negative"
"8669","Gave as a gift so have no knowledge if it meets that persons requirements","Positive"
"8670","Even the learning process is FUN!","Positive"
"8671","Everything about the echo is awesome.  Cannot wait for additional product tie ins.","Negative"
"8672","I wish it interfaced with Google so that it could provide more information. Otherwise,  great purchase.","Positive"
"8673","I have enjoyed it very much so far.  I have been able to link all my apps to it so far.","Positive"

"8678","I usually know about the new tech products but I had not studied Echo till my daughter gave it to me for Christmas. I can only say that I'm extremely impressed with the sound, the ease of use and the variety of actions it is capable of doing. Great product Amazon. I love you guys!","Positive"
"8679","Purchased for my wife, she absolutely loved it. Great iteam definitely would recommend.","Positive"
"8680","This was everything we thought it would be and more. The sound throughout our home is wonderful and all the inquiries we can make are great","Positive"

"8685","Music sounds great and voice command works. It seems to offer suggestions based on music you play a lot.","Positive"
"8686","It is awesome","Positive"
"8687","LOVE IT! Bought 2 more as gifts for Christmas.","Positive"
"8688","Does not always work as planned. Did well in my connected home but poorly out on the road. Also the top falls off way too easy and mine now does not like to stay installed. Poor design.","Positive"

"8692","Love it! We're having soooo much fun with it!","Positive"
"8693","Amazing device, loving it, but wife is worried it's always listening","Positive"
"8694","Had it for a couple months, finally activate it, and couldn't stop playing with it.  Have book from Amazon that I haven't read yet, glad it can read it to me.  Still learning all its features, read a review where someone had it do rain sound, will definitely try that. It's my favorite toy now.","Positive"
"8695","Very nice addition to the home.","Positive"
"8696","Love this","Positive"
"8697","We welcomed Alexa to our family after Black Friday where we got a deal.  We have had such great fun having her tell us jokes, play our favorite music (we use Spotify), challenge her on the 20 questions game, play Jeopardy with her, find out the weather, and, of course, the kids love asking her their homework questions.  Truly, it is like having a new game to play with.  The Echo is easy to set up - yep, even I, the least tech-savy of the family, set it up.  It is no wonder this item sold out on-line just before Christmas.","Positive"
"8698","Great product; use it every day","Positive"
"8699","the best tech ive bought in a long time","Positive"
"8700","Wife said it was the best present ever! Can't get all the songs without paying only downfall","Negative"
"8701","Love it! Use it every day.","Positive"
"8702","It is an amazing device. We love it.","Positive"
"8703","This is awesome!","Positive"
"8704","Alexa is part of my kiddos routine. In the morning I hear my 8 year old asked ""Alexa, what's the weather outside"" (it helps her figure out what to wear) Texas weather .. you have to check. It can be a warm winter today and freezing spring tomorrow lol","Positive"
"8705","She is a great addition to the family.  Love the music and sound","Positive"
"8706","I love the product and I will consider giving it as a gift to family and friends.","Positive"
"8707","great gift to my son but I paid 3.99 for gift wrap and it was not gift wrapped.","Positive"
"8708","Incredible product","Positive"
"8709","I just love this!  Play it every day!!","Positive"
"8710","A Christmas gift that was not received well until my wife started using it and now we both love it.","Positive"
"8711","Wife absolutely loves the Echo. She is generally technophobic so if she likes this, it is a big deal.","Positive"
"8712","Easy setup (almost <U+F8FF>-like simplicity). I would recommend this to anyone.","Positive"
"8713","Love the Amazon Echo!  However, I have just had it set up for about 2 weeks now, and am still learning to use it and remembering the ""catch phrases"" to get the information I am searching for.  A lot of what the Echo provides (like music, time, weather, briefings, managing our evolving smart home, etc) is intuitive, but there is still a learning curve for me to figure out other things.  I was a little disappointed that I could not just ask Alexa a question that you might be able to find from searching online for the answer.  Perhaps time and training will improve this process.","Positive"
"8714","  Alexa help them with their homework. They play multiplication with her. My boy never fail to say ""Good morning Alexa!""  Then Alexa answes with history or fun fact of the day. My four year old asked Alexa to play her most favorite song .. she said ""Alexa always put sunshine in my pocket and good soul in my feet"" ha ha !  I love that Alexa can also play some Filipino songs. My parent enjoyed that so much! I have to say Amazon echo is a very good investment. I will forever remember how my kids enjoy this wonderful electronic. Amazing creation of The Prime (Amazon)","Positive"
"8715","Great fun device","Positive"
"8716","The Echo is outstanding and I think part of it's appeal is that it keeps evolving to include new features.","Positive"
"8717","We love our Echo.","Positive"
"8718","It was a little challenging to set up but now that it is set up it's been a lot of fun. It will be interesting to see how much we use Echo day in day out.","Positive"
"8719","The echo is a beautiful concept and when you have creators jumping on board sky is the limit. Also the one feature where amazon can stay ahead of it's competitors is the ability to order goods until Cortana learns how to order from Walmart and Target!","Positive"
"8720","Received as a gift for Christmas. So far, I like it. I have the Echo sitting in the middle of my apartment so that I can basically talk to it just about anywhere, although in the distant corners you have to raise your voice a bit. Since I've had it for 3 days now, my main functions have been to play music with it, check weather, or make lists.","Positive"
"8721","So far, as far as speaker and sound quality, I think it works well as a stand alone speaker. I have not hooked up any other devices to it through bluetooth. I've been playing Pandora through it, which is more enjoyable now than having to load the app on my phone, and then connect it to whatever device. There is a good amount of bass from the subwoofer, and the maximum volume setting is loud, with no distortions that I've noticed. The only thing is that when the volume is cranked, it can have a problem hearing you. But this could also be because I have it sitting to close to a wall, so the echoing probably intensifies.","Positive"
"8722","I also received a Phillips Hue Starter Pack, and already hooked it up through the Echo. There was a bit of a learning curve (advice: light bulb names are important). But after a little effort they all work great. I haven't gotten as far as changing colors through the Echo, but that will be one of my next projects, and I will write about it here.","Positive"
"8723","I haven't been able to spend as much time as I would like with it yet, but this period of the year in December is always busy. The list function is handy, and it's nice to get the time, set a timer, or get the weather without going to my phone all the time. As I discover new features and get more used to it, I will continue updating my review. Although there are thousands of reviews on here, so I'm sure you can find what you're looking for.","Positive"
"8724","5 stars enough said","Positive"
"8725","Works well -  We now listen to much more music while we are at home.  Can set the mood.","Positive"
"8726","Alexa has fit in nicely except she is on daylight saving time and I do not know how to correct it.","Positive"
"8727","Pretty cool gadget to have around.","Positive"
"8728","The kids loved it and are still raving about it.","Negative"
"8729","Very satisfied after using for 2 days. Easy to set up.","Positive"
"8730","Love Love Love it!","Positive"
"8731","Fun, easy to set-up and use.  Some problems with voice recognition even after completing the voice set-up drills.  Skills info and tricks of the trade for using the basic apps are not included with the instructions (how much info can they fit on a 3x3 inch card?, but lots of info is available at the Amazon site, and from email updates received direct from Amazon.  We purchased two separate, highly-rated paperback books to help familiarize ourselves with skills and commands.  The variety of home automation products for use with the Echo are many...most appear to have sensitive set-up issues or infant mortality concerns (with poor support comments from users).  Wish Amazon would market its' own line of endorsed home automation accessories for the Echo that support simple plug and play end-user installation.  We also purchased the Amazon Echo remote separately...makes the Echo must more versatile.  Just wish we could select a different/custom wake-up name other than the limited three...""H.A.L."" would be cool!  Weatherbug","Positive"
"8732","This is the most useless piece of crap. It seems that no matter what I ask it, it always says that it doesn't know the answer. It will be good for target practice. I didn't pay for it thank God. I wasted some of my airline miles on it.","Negative"
"8733","We've been using Alexa for couple of days now and I am underwhelmed by how little Alexa ""knows"" and understands. The hilarity of incorrect responses wears off pretty quickly and gets replaced by frustration over the money spent on a rather dumb Bluetooth speaker. We even took the time to train Alexa to our voices but it didn't make much of a difference. After all that hype in the media it seemed like Amazon has cracked the code. Instead, Alexa is like Apple's Siri, just worse!","Negative"
"8734","Christmas gift for my wife. We both love it.","Positive"
"8735","Love mine!","Positive"
"8736","This thing is just awesome!!  I am very impressed and music sound quality is amazing.","Positive"
"8737","I love me Echo. Great sound, portability and accessibility. I appreciate having my Amazon play lists linked to echo. ""She's"" learning new skills weekly. Bought my wife a Tap also.","Positive"
"8738","Love it!","Positive"
"8739","Amazing!  Getting used to all it can do but loving it.","Positive"
"8740","This now makes my home hands free!  I can turn on lights, play music order more items from amazon !! Received this as a gift and set up was rediculious easy.  So far just the sound speaker was a worth the $.  Everything else is just a plus.  So many items like this don't serve a long term purpose but this was useful right out of the box.","Positive"
"8741","Setup is ongoing and I feel I have only broke the surface of what it can do.","Negative"
"8742","Please mark helpful it is was! Thank you.","Positive"
"8743","Bought this for my parents for Christmas, they love it! They started using it for the shopping list, to keep a timer, and Pandora.","Positive"
"8744","This is so awesome,everyone should have Amazon Eoho","Positive"
"8745","LOVE MY ECHO.. IT IS AWESOME. I DO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT NOT COMING ON ALL THE TIME. I AM NOT SURE IF IT IS BECAUSE IT IS REFURBISHED OF WHAT. BUT I HAVE NO TIME TO SEND IT BACK. I WILL MAKE IT WORK :-0","Positive"
"8746","Excellent addition to our household. My wife has even used this and it just makes our life easier.  Thanks Amazon!","Positive"
"8747","LOVE IT!!","Positive"
"8748","Sounds great understands commands pretty good but very limited on local weather information lack of detail like forecast wind speed precipitation amount and actuals. So many skills to enable and remember if you don't say it just right it's not going bring it up.","Positive"
"8749","So much fun! Got it as a gift for my son in law and daughter. Easy to set up!","Positive"
"8750","Husband happy","Positive"
"8751","Bought this over the holidays when it was on sale and had to wait until after Christmas for delivery due to high demand. I just finished setting this up after it arrived in the mail. So far, so good. I had a bit of an issue with the app on my phone but I'm not sure if that was a problem with my WiFi or the app itself. In any event, got it set up and immediately started playing music! Not the absolute highest quality speaker for music but it gets the job done. Louder than I thought it would be! I'll see how this works out int eh long term but for now I'm happy with my purchase.","Positive"
"8752","GREAT.","Positive"
"8753","Gave as a gift and they loved it.","Positive"
"8754","Works great.","Positive"
"8755","Works great. Volume is perfect!","Positive"
"8756","We gpot thus for Xmas, had great fun with it the first day. It recognized our commands instantly, we installed games and listened to music. The volume was great, the music coyuld fill up a large room. Then today, the second we ever used it, it stopped hearing our commands, the music volume is really soft where as the Alexa voice is able to be turned way up to 10 or down, the music stays at about 3. Very uphappy with this happening after one day, no accidents, no reason this expensive thing shouldn't continue to work well like it did yesterday.","Positive"
"8757","Very fun, sound is good quality as well.","Positive"
"8758","Absolutely love our Echo. One of the best things we ever purchased !","Positive"
"8759","It is great. Really enjoy the features.","Positive"
"8760","Great product","Positive"
"8761","Truly, it's awful.  I spend all my time listening to Alexis tell me she doesn't know what I want.  The hardware is literally 6 feet from me, but it still sucks.  Earlier times were better, but it's all gone downhill lately.  Stuttering and missing playback.  At any rate, good luck.","Negative"
"8762","Get off your butt and get this wonderful device!","Positive"
"8763","Get to listen to TuneIn to have free access to my fav jazz tracks!","Positive"

"8766","I love it","Positive"
"8767","Love the Echo, glad I purchased b4 the holiday sell out..","Positive"
"8768","It's pretty much worthless unless you enable it's ""skills"" through the app.  Even then, a week later it has forgotten the ""skill"" and it needs to be re-enabled (which may or may not work). It remembers nothing, so if the power goes out - too bad, you have to redo the WIFI setup. Doesn't work with iTunes or Google Play Music which is where we purchase content.  We don't do our grocery shopping on Amazon, so not sure why I would make my grocery list on this thing.","Positive"
"8769","Usability sucks as it seems that I constantly have to pull out my phone to 'enable' it to do something, which I thought the point of this thing was to be hands-free?  Allrecipes.com seemed like a cool integration, but you have to get out your phone, go to the app, find the ""skill"", enable it, hope that it works...but that's not enough - you need to connect it to your allrecipes.com account and if you don't have one then you'll have to create one.... I just want to know what I can make with my leftover egg whites, or what I can substitute for soy sauce.","Positive"
"8770","I don't want to sound like Debbie Downer here - I really thought this thing would be great. My kids like to have it tell them bad jokes at dinner time.  So there is that. Voice command cooking timers - there is your killer app.  Sorry to say, but I kinda hate your product.","Negative"
"8771","I had already had an Echo since the beginning of the ""beta"" testing for consumers. This particular one was a gift for a very non-techy couple. I set it up for them and they LOVE it. They even purchased Prime, because they mostly wanted the music. I'm not sure they will use it to its full potential, maybe on each of my visits I'll teach them a little more.","Positive"
"8772","love it","Positive"
"8773","Still playing around with it and learning things to do with it. I really like that you can choose the year and type of music that you want to hear. Ordered one for the elderly parents and hopefully they will enjoy it even if they just use it for music.","Positive"
"8774","What's not to love. Having so much fun with it.","Positive"
"8775","I bought it for my husband for his B day. I love it, he thinks their is a woman inside, he keeps talking to the machine like he is talking to a human, he thinks it's funny. He says meek my wife happy and ply some .... the mechune doesn't get it, I keep telling him to say Alexa than say what you want .... he makes me laugh .he just doesn't get it","Positive"
"8776","Great","Positive"
"8777","Great product but she can't understand certain phrases. And when I was setting it up on another phone it took forever because it didn't want to sync.","Positive"

"8787","I love the Echo.  Fun, informative and it can search for info faster than I can on Google.","Positive"
"8788","Just got it for Christmas and love it so far! Only gave it 4 stars for now, just because I haven't used it to full potential yet. Can't wait to add some wifi bulbs and thermostat into the mix!","Negative"
"8789","It is great","Positive"
"8790","Alexa is a lot of help! Loving my Echo :)","Positive"

"8792","Awesome what ""Alexa"" all knows!","Positive"
"8793","This is great","Positive"
"8794","Fun to play with although the sound quality is really lacking bass due to the small woofer in the unit.  Of course I am an audio guy and picky about sound...I am enjoying the news flash feature especially while having my coffee in the AM","Negative"
"8795","I like it it's fun.","Positive"
"8796","This product is useful daily. Many of the skills preform well. Many skills do not function. The speaker has good quality sound. The product was easily set up.","Positive"
"8797","I got this for my mother in law and she is loving it! I wasn't sure what to expect, and didn't really understand what the excitement was about. Now that I've used it in person, I'm thinking about getting one for myself!","Positive"

"8803","We are thoroughly enjoying our Echo! Right now using mostly for music and general informaion purposes, but Alexa does not disappoint.","Positive"
"8804","The Amazon Echo was received as described and was very easy to setup. The echo could not respond to some of my commands, but over all I am very pleased with this item and would highly recommend it.","Positive"
"8805","Device does not respond the same as new devices.  Not happy with refurbished version.  Unresponsive when playing sound or songs in attempting to stop it.  Have to unplug it and plug back in.  Very frustrating and annoying when attempting to show off the device and it simply doesnt work.","Negative"
"8806","Great","Positive"
"8807","Love Alexa!","Positive"
"8808","I really love the Echo I am older and electronically challenged easy set up have not quite mastered the skills THE echo IS A Very High Quality Item always can depend on Amazon to put out nothing but the best Sound Quality is Great took out the $3.99 Echo music plan + of course have Prime Account all the music U can ask for Echo answers most every Question I ask She is learning every day about what I like Thanks Amazon","Positive"
"8809","Great addition to my black echo. Now I have enjoyment of my echo in my rv as well as home.","Positive"
"8810","Love it!!! I use Alexa everyday","Positive"
"8811","The Echo is so much fun to use, I love that I can listen to the music I want to hear.  Haven't had very long, but so far there are no complaints.","Positive"
"8812","What a delight to play with Alexa and be informed about anything under the sun. Also, music on voice demand. So FUN.","Positive"
"8813","Amazon Echo is a good home automation device, Alexa does a great job of hearing you across the room.  And there so many skills, that you will find something you can use!  I look forward to additional skills such as a Papa John's pizza skill!","Positive"
"8814","I think Alexa needs a little more work on the natural conversation and the ability to find answers similar to google's ""what sound does a whale make""","Positive"
"8815","I love my Echo! I call her Alexa. I love the add to calendar and shopping list apps among many others. Very useful.","Positive"
"8816","Also, you must have an additional subscription to Amazon music to listen to most music.  I was a bit confused since I can stream music with the Amazon Music via my Amazon Prime subscription.","Negative"
"8817","Unbelievable what Alexa can do! Very happy with this purchase.","Negative"
"8818","I got the Echo for my Dad, we hooked it up yesterday and started talking to Alexa. Asking her basic questions and just testing her a bit and found she can't answer some really basic questions. I told my Dad that hopefully Amazon will come out with some updates to improve her IQ. He wanted her mostly for answering questions and news. He's not very impressed.","Positive"
"8819","Works great","Positive"
"8820","I've had my Echo for about a month and I have to say that Alexa is fun to have around. I use her to wake me up (Alec Baldwin does it actually); instead of picking my phone up I ask her the time; she reads me the news while I do other things; she'll tell me what's on my calendar for tomorrow; and she plays music when I ask her to and she helps me get to sleep with relaxing night sounds. Usually she understands what I'm asking of her, even if she can't always answer. It'd be very nice if she could read emails and text messages, and there are some other skills that would be enjoyable. Oddly, my wife uses Alexa even more than I do. All in all, she's very, very nice to have around and well worth the investment.","Positive"
"8821","I love it. It's great with so many things you can do  with it","Positive"
"8822","Love it!","Positive"
"8823","Extraordinary, it performs so many functions, with great sound quality.","Positive"
"8824","Great product but sometimes wakes up by itself. Hope they continue to do more with it.","Positive"
"8825","Totally cool","Positive"
"8826","easy to install. Works very well.","Positive"
"8827","Perfect.  Thanks.","Positive"
"8828","We just got the ECHO for Christmas and we love it.  The only issue I have is that she isn't able to answer some simple questions.  For example, 'How fast does the Earth spin?""  Anyway, I'm hopeful Amazon will continue to update her firmware so ALEXA can expand her knowledge.","Positive"
"8829","This is the 4th echo purchased in our family.  Obviously, we love them!","Positive"
"8830","I have only been using it a couple of days, but so far Alexa is lightyears ahead of Siri and has done a great job responding to my requests. I do wish I could use Alexa to open apps on my phone without having to unlock my iphone, but there seem to be ""skills"" to activate to cover most of my frequently used applications which helps!","Positive"
"8831","It's great l love it","Positive"
"8832","Enjoy seeing the new skills that get added daily.","Positive"
"8833","This is the second one we purchased, my mother lives with us and she saw how easy it was to use, so it was a great Christmas gift.","Positive"
"8834","Good voice recognition.","Positive"
"8835","So-so speaker, not enough top end mid to mid-high frequency response.","Positive"
"8836","Love it.  It works great with my car.","Positive"
"8837","Not enough voice commands available.","Positive"
"8838","Overall, poor/dumb syntax recognition.","Negative"
"8839","Very limited app for setting up preferences.  Only one traffic destination?  I drive to more than one destination on a regular basis.","Negative"
"8840","Needs way more development for command interface to be useful.  As of now. more of a toy than a tool.","Positive"
"8841","For the length of time that this has been in development the software back end is lacking.","Negative"
"8842","Excellent product and technology. You can do so much with this unit.","Positive"
"8843","So far so good..thank you. .","Positive"
"8844","Home automation and IFTTT work great","Positive"
"8845","Everything I had to look up on my I phone I can just ask Alexa while I'm walking through the house , total hands free, Fantastic","Positive"
"8846","So my Amazon Echo died on me :-( I'll be calling Customer service today. It won't turn on at all and has sat stationary since we bought it in December so it has to be something internal.  Missing Alexa.","Negative"
"8847","Haven't figured out how to change the search engine which uses Bing. There should be an option as many questions are not answered because of it is using an inferior search engine. Echo should akso be able to assign more than one address at a time (home, work, school) in order to offer traffic and directions.","Positive"
"8848","Works good.  Still learning.  Documentation is poor. Bought 2 books written for Echo and still clear as mud on some subjects.","Positive"
"8849","We are loving this!","Positive"
"8850","I really enjoy this.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of sound when playing music.","Positive"
"8851","Amazon Echo is great, but a little bass in the sound system would have been perfect.","Positive"
"8852","Awesome. Great fun and helpful too. Adding new things to do daily.","Positive"
"8853","My Echo has will not connect to Wi-Fi and continues to complete set up and then return to set up. The Amazon customer service team was thorough and helpful, but I have spent three hours troubleshooting myself, and an hour and ten minutes with Amazon customer service and technical support. I will be patient to wait for resolution in two days, but not enjoying my Echo experience so far.","Positive"
"8854","Love it so much I have 3.","Positive"
"8855","We love it and use it all day to play music.","Positive"
"8856","It is great the kids love it. We enjoy it so much. It is worth every penny.","Positive"
"8857","Alexa is perfect. More than I expected. I love being able to get the music I want with just a simple request.","Positive"
"8858","Love it!!","Positive"
"8859","Was great but other items i ordered from you had no return labels","Positive"
"8860","Still learning all the Skills to enable. But love it. Super fast at answering questions.","Positive"
"8861","There are no words to properly express what a lifestyle altering device this has turned out to be. It will truly transform anyone's household from the most technically basic to the most technically sophisticated! Kudos to Alexa as the smartest personal assistant in the world!","Positive"
"8862","Great. Easy to set up.","Positive"
"8863","I'm still exploring what the Echo can do. It has been so much fun to use during the holidays. So far I'm using it mostly for news, weather, music, and Audible books but hope to use the Smart Home features in the near future.","Positive"
"8864","We just love her. She plays music from Glen Miller, answers questions, gibes us the weather and lots more. We really are enjoying her.","Positive"
"8865","My husband loved his gift but said if he didn't have the book (which I had to purchase separately) he would have been lost on how to use it. Otherwise, it was a big hit.","Positive"
"8866","You've read all the reviews and yes its great!","Positive"
"8867","Did not realize that there would be additional charges for music, etc. The instrument alone is satisfactory.","Positive"
"8868","still learning the capabilities but love it so far","Positive"
"8869","Everything it is claimed to be and will do.  I think an Echo Dot is next on my purchases or maybe two. It will only get better with the advancement of the hardware and software. My two sons want one now too.","Positive"
"8870","very fun... speaker/sound quality is very good, linking to music sources is awesome. Discovering new skills daily.","Positive"
"8871","Excellent.","Positive"
"8872","I bought the Echo for my 71 yr old mother, who has never mastered how to use a computer, let alone a smartphone. She loves to listen to Spanish music, but we have horrible stations where we live. So I bought her the Echo, figuring the less she actually had to DO to make it work, the better. I played with it for a couple weeks before Christmas so that I could show her how to use it, and it's SO EASY. The setup for super easy...took me 2 minutes. All I have to say is ""Alexa, play Celia Cruz"" (my mom's favorite), and immediately, Alexa informed me that she was shuffling Celia Cruz songs, and started playing them. She sets timers for me, alarms, tells me the weather, and tells me jokes! I almost didn't give this to my mom. But the guilt would have been too much for me, so now my mom owns it. She doesn't have to worry about pressing wrong buttons or anything...just speak. LOVE IT.","Positive"
"8873","Happy with quality. Worked as advertised.","Positive"
"8874","Love it. Particularly for flash news briefings & random music selections. Highly recommend.","Positive"
"8875","Works exactly as advertised.","Positive"
"8876","Love, love, love it!!","Positive"
"8877","Use it in the kitchen, love it!","Positive"
"8878","What an amazing product, we love this Echo so much we purchased two more for our kids Christmas. The clarity of the sound is excellent, being able to ask for a specific song or even asking a general knowledge question, the Echo performs like a personal genius. Highly recommend for everyone.","Positive"
"8879","Still learning new things with it, but absolutely love it!","Positive"
"8880","I LOVE it! Just wayyyy to much fun! I feel so lazy using it hahah but I love it. I have to play around with it a bit more to see where the best spot in my house is, the Alexa couldn't hear me when it was up at volume 10, but that might be a minor adjustment of placement issues. Otherwise, my husband, kids and I are having a ball with it!","Positive"
"8881","love it - so fun","Positive"
"8882","This was a gift. I have a echo and love it","Positive"
"8883","Great product but can't answer all questions - looking forward to future enhancements - wish I could teach Alexa to say to learn my voice and say my name","Positive"
"8884","Absolutely as advertised!  Alexa is a GREAT addition to our kitchen, a very handy assistant! I also added the Wink Hub to the mix and now Alexa turns lights on/off on command!  You won't be disappointed with Alexa in your house!","Positive"
"8885","Love it!","Positive"
"8886","echo is great","Positive"
"8887","no issues","Negative"
"8888","I have really enjoyed this product.","Positive"
"8889","I realize that this is fairly new, but I've had Echo for 2 months and it gets 80% of the things wrong. Alexa is great with jokes. And it's somewhat entertaining however it does not work as well as promoted.","Positive"
"8890","Downloaded the Alexa app on  my tablet but after many, many hours of trying to connect to the internet. It just does not work. I will probably make a planter out of it. I am tech savvy, running windows 7 plus windows 10 on another platform. I downloaded the Alexa app about 6 weeks ago but cannot get it to connect to the internet after many hours of trying. This is just money thrown out. I will never recommend","Positive"
"8891","an amazon product to anyone. At least I can enjoy the planter.","Positive"
"8892","It made a great Christmas gift and she loved it","Positive"
"8893","Really helpful.","Positive"
"8894","I got several echos... one in white and the rest in black. I also got one echo dot. I like the speakers on the Echo a lot better.","Positive"
"8895","Although I do love it. It's not just plug and play there are apps to download and then skills to add but once that's done it is easy","Positive"
"8896","My fiances father is paralyzed from the neck down. He has a computer with voice activated software that enables him to live on his own, but every week or so his computer crashes. When his computer crashes, he used to have no ability to even let anyone know his computer was off. Sometimes it would be hours before anyone figured it out.","Negative"
"8897","I've had this product for over a year and I do like it but...I think she definitely still needs some improvements.  She doesn't understand sometimes even when she prompts you to ask her things and then she doesn't understand the question.  The apps should be easier to use and she doesn't seem to work all the time for the past month Alexa has been unable to perform things like play music or answer a question many times. She's on my kitchen counter and I really love the idea of the product and she's great when she understands and is working properly.  Her lists and alarms are great, the music feature is awesome purchasing is awesome as long as she's able to complete the tasks.","Positive"
"8898","When I heard about Echo, the first thing I wanted to do is see if it had the ability to send a text message to people incase his computer crashed. When I saw it did, My fiance and I instantly got it for him. Even if the Echo did nothing else, doing that one thing was enough.","Positive"
"8899","At first he had no idea what the Echo was, but he didn't want to get his hopes up. When he realized that it could send text messages though, he began to ask a lot of questions.","Positive"
"8900","After he realized all the apps he could get, we both suddenly realized the echo wasn't just something that could send out a message, it could do a lot more. It's been less than 15 hours since we gave him the app and already he is talking about all the cool things he can do like listen to pandora, IHeartRadio, tell him the weather or time, or even just listen to thunderstorm sounds. The Echo is like having a tablet with thousands of apps, but no hands required.","Positive"
"8901","He's only just begun figuring out all the capabilities of the Echo, but as one of his best friends said after talking to him about it: he sounded like a kid with a new toy.","Positive"
"8902","If anyone knows someone with a movement disability, I highly encourage getting this for them. Even if they have a computer already, it's a life changer.","Positive"
"8903","I enjoy my Echo...the information provided is endless!","Positive"
"8904","Alexa is very cool.  Takes time to learn how to speak to her to get what you want.  Once you learn it's a great help for all sorts of things.","Positive"
"8905","LOVE it! fun to use for family. arrived on time and packaged well.","Positive"
"8906","Echo was a xmass gift for hubby - he is learning more about it every day.","Positive"
"8907","I love Amazon, but this product needs lot of work.","Positive"
"8908"," I purchased 5 dots at Christmas this year and so far so good.  But I don't know if they are meant to last...or function for a long time.","Positive"
"8909","I read lots of reviews and many people reported issues with connecting to their WiFi and initial set up.  I use an iPhone and had no issue with the set up.  My advice is to download the Amazon Alexa app and have your WiFi network name and password ready before you power on your new Alexa for the first time.","Negative"
"8910","Ok, onto the issues...","Negative"
"8911","After the initial setup I played music from my Amazon music library and my face drooped, it sounds like music from the tin can, the Campbell soup cans that we used to make walkies-talkie when we were kids by connecting a tin wire to the center of the bottom of the cans.  For that kind of money I was expecting something to sound as least as good my Bose WiFi speaker, but this is not even close.  It's worse than a cheapo NUU Riptide WiFi speaker.  They need to work with an Audio Laboratory like Bose to improve the audio for playing music.","Positive"
"8912","I was expecting it to have a battery so that I can temporary disconnect the power adapter to relocate Alexa without interruption, but not.  I was shocked when I disconnected the adapter from the wall, Alexa drops dead! ;-(  They need to add a small battery to the unit to provide this capability.","Negative"
"8913","The other issues of concern is the reliability and durability of the product.  Many customers reported problem with the power adapter going bad and had to wait for a month or more to get a replacement.  If Alexa becomes part of your life, it would be painful to be without for a month or more.  Many customers also reported the unit, Alexa, got a stroke, a heart attack, or caught on fire after a few months to a year, when they are outside of the return or warranty period.  This is a serious quality control issue and need to be address with the manufacturers in China.  Perhaps use the same manufacturers who makes Apple products, I found their products are very reliable.  My power adapter for my iPhone 5S still working on my iPhone 6S.","Positive"
"8914","We love the Echo and use it constantly - mostly for favorite music.","Positive"
"8915","Wife loves it so far!","Positive"
"8916","Purchased this for my granddaughter for Christmas. Her uncle has one and she loved it and wanted her own, when the price came down on Thanksgiving I ordered it for her. It arrived quickly and on Christmas Day her uncle helped her set it up, she is very happy with her gift.","Positive"
"8917","Worked great when we got it, but after 2 months it doesn't work without being touched.","Positive"
"8918","Returned, item is crap. Alexa does not do as advertised, does not work , sounds is lousy. Don't buy waste of money and so expensive.","Negative"
"8919"," I did get the warranty and will be using it to hopefully fix these issues.","Negative"
"8920","Truly think is wonderful.","Positive"
"8921","I am enjoying my Echo but sometimes after I enable a skill and then ask a question she says ""enable the skill""  then I say enable and she will say you already have.  Would like to see it play Siriusxm radio","Positive"
"8922","Delivery was good and on time. The item was a gift for someone else & they seem to be very happy with it. Lots of learning to do though. :-)","Positive"
"8923","My Alexa still is not working. Nor has anyone called me back concerning helping me get it set up","Positive"
"8924","I would have given a 5 star but, the instructions for how to set up are pretty non existent  If you don't understand cyber lingo.  HELP","Positive"
"8925","IT'S OK - YOU HAVE TO SUBSCRIBE TO AMAZON MUSIC TO GET IT TO PLAY MUSIC AND IT DOESN'T ANSWER A LOT OF QUESTIONS.  SPEAKER QUALITY IS GOOD -","Positive"
"8926","excited about this purchase and my 4 year old loves to ask for songs. I wish the library of music was more and it seems she doesn't have a lot of answers to questions we ask. perhaps I need a software update.","Positive"
"8927","Absolutely love it","Positive"
"8928","My boys initially wanted this as a gift, but then decided they would prefer the Dot instead , so they can each have one in their own room.","Positive"
"8929","Best gift for college student","Positive"
"8930","We are still learning what Alexa can do... She is now connected to our Amazon, Pandora and smart thermostat.  Love her!! :)","Positive"
"8931","Fantastic product purchased for my family","Positive"
"8932","Three stars - it's OK. First the good news. We're both enamored with our Echo. Alexa is smart, funny, knowledgable and fast. My wife loves it and is not concerned with frequency response.","Positive"
"8933","I am most definitely concerned with frequency response. ""2.5 inch woofer delivers deep rich response."" Not. ""Echo has been fine-tuned to deliver crisp vocals with dynamic bass response."" Not. Its dual downward-firing speakers produce 360 omni-directional audio to fill any room with immersive sound."" Not. The sound is thin and boomy and since I already own several Airplay-enabled speaker systems, I'm not about to replace them with Echo-compatible ones. As far as I can tell Echo is not compatible with my Airplay-enabled Denon receivers.","Positive"
"8934","I would jack up the rating to five stars if Echo could connect to my Mac and control my vast iTunes library, but alas, Amazon and Apple are probably not going to make that happen. ""Hands-free voice control is not supported for Mac OS X devices.""","Positive"
"8935","came damaged - had a terrible time getting it replaced - still trying!  Echo was dented at the top","Negative"
"8936","It's kinda fun to have it around the house. Finding out just how many things it can't answer. I think my Echo needs a hearing aid. Even so, I do like the thing. I think the $179. price tag is a bit high. Main thing I like is that I can control my lighting with it.","Positive"
"8937","Ms Alexa i love you any song i am in the mood for you bring it up at the sound of my voice . You get me the new wheater and reminded me what a life changer . I her for Christmas and havent even tap it potential but what i have i Love. Was so Easy to get started sound is incredible thank you Amazon","Positive"

"8944","Love it.","Positive"
"8945","Having issues connecting to phone, but enjoying all that it can do!","Negative"
"8946","Best gift ever","Positive"
"8947","It is a cool product.  I bought this one thinking it would have really good sound.  The highs and mid ranges are good but the bass is seriously lacking.  I have an echo dot and its connected to a bose Bluetooth speaker and that sounds awesome.  My suggestion is get an echo dot and a Bluetooth speaker or connect to your stereo.  IMO not worth the price if you listen to music like I do.","Positive"
"8948","The Echo is a pretty piece of technology, makes our home feel more comfortable . We have Alexa playing music, telling us jokes, she gives us information of the day and have access to information without having to get on the Internet.  Best purchase we have made in long time.

"8955","This was a gift for son'so wife but the whole family loves it.  The granddaughter asks Alexa for a joke every day.","Positive"
"8956","The sound is much better than expected and the microphones and voice recognition work extremely well. I am excited to see the evolution as there are so many more opportunities for this product. I love this thing and hope they continue to add services to it.","Positive"
"8957","Love,love, love","Positive"
"8958","Bought for family. Wife was skeptical but we love the features and the future potential of this product,","Negative"
"8959","I really like my Echo but I could only give it 4 stars for a couple of reasons.  Some of this could probably be solved with software updates and if it is I will be more than happy to update my review to a 5 star!  First off the major miss that I can see with the unit is voice recognition.  If you have a personal assistant in the home it should really be able to tell who is talking to it... For example I am the main person who uses the lists and such but I also have Alexa setup to turn on and off the TV or lights but my daughter has realized how this works so she likes to try and give Alexa countermanding orders if she doesn't want the lights on or the TV off... So it would be nice if you could setup different voice profiles on the unit so that if Alexa hears me give an order she follows it but if my daughter does then she might ask my wife or I if that is ok (assuming that's how you have your profiles setup)... It would also give you the option of having multiple shopping to-do lists so my wife can keep her own if needed.  Next the echo does great at understanding what I'm saying assuming a bunch of other people are not talking at the same time I try to give commands... This could also probably be solved by a better voice recognition that way she would only really care about what is being said by the person who said Alexa. Next I wish they would integrate more of their products together..  For example I have a fire stick that has Alexa baked in but the Echo cant control that device even though both of the voice controls for the units are using Alexa which means I have to go find my fire stick remote if I want to use Alexa to search for movies or anything of that nature on the stick.  Lastly my only other gripe would be how limited some of the skills out there for the echo are.  I feel like amazon must have rushed some of the third parties to hurry up and get content out for the echo as for example the harmony hub can start an activity or turn off an activity but cant do much more than that.  While I know they can control the devices through their app on the phone which means that the coding to control the devices through WIFI is there they just rushed to get the skill out for echo and didn't take the time to come up with a good voice control scheme for doing more with it... Like I said before most of these issues can probably be solved with software updates and I really hope they are as otherwise I love my echo and the voice control over my smart home items is a really neat function!  She also does a decent job at understanding what I'm asking for and not a horrible job at picking out key words when other people are talking.  The music quality might not be up to an audiophiles standards but for a casual music listener like me it works great!","Positive"
"8960","We love Alexa!","Positive"
"8961","Bought as gift for my son. Amazing!","Positive"
"8962","I was an early adopter, and purchased my Echo when they first became available to Prime members in early 2015. Unfortunately, my Echo intermittently stopped producing any sound about a year after I bought it. The only way to get it working again was to unplug it for a while, then plug it back in. I went through a few rounds of troubleshooting with Amazon's Echo tech support, to no avail. Since it was out of warranty, their only ""solution"" was to offer to sell me a new Echo for $20 more than I paid for the original one. Hardly a satisfactory solution in my opinion.","Positive"
"8963","Awesome.  So much fun","Positive"
"8964","this was a gift for our son and family and they absolutely love it","Positive"
"8965","got this for my niece for Christmas per her request.  she is loving it!!!!!","Positive"
"8966","Great item. I have two, this one is for the bedroom","Positive"
"8967","Love love love it!  It does everything it says and keeps you updated to do more.","Positive"
"8968","Excellent product and easy to set up! One issue is to listen to music you have to have a full Spotify account.","Positive"
"8969","Echo is a fun gadget. Our family has played silly games with it -- like asking about the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow, then chuckling at the Monty Python-inspired answer. We've also asked about the weather, or used it to play selections on Spotify. I don't think it does much that you can't already do with a phone and Bluetooth speaker, but it works as advertised.","Positive"
"8970","Awesome","Positive"
"8971","This was a great buy for a super Christmas present. It was loved by all who had a terrific time playing with it.i would definitely recommend this.","Positive"
"8972","The Amazon Echo is a fun way to play music and integrate with home automation.  Very easy to set up and begin using (all within minutes of opening the box).","Positive"
"8973","You seem to have to download a lot of apps to get the full use.  I am sick of signing in with user names and passwords, and really don't have the desire to sign up and take up space on my mobile devices and manage more apps. So I find the Ecco disappointing compared to the advertisements.","Negative"
"8974","I got this as a Xmas gift for my 2 grandsons and they are having a ball with it. A great family gift that all will enjoy.","Positive"
"8975","Really great.  Bought one for our home and gave one as a gift","Positive"
"8976","The product is pretty neat. No need for an actual stereo. The sound is quality an u can listen to all tour favorite music. Control from tour phone as well.","Positive"
"8977","We love it and wonder why we did not get one sooner.","Positive"
"8978","I like the echo but I'm having an issue connecting to 117s.  I also purchased one for my brother and the had no issues connecting.  I'm going to try to reset and start over; hopefully this will work.  Most songs I ask for Alexa says aren't available.","Positive"
"8979","Great Product","Positive"
"8980","My son and my husband played with this off and on all day on Christmas.  They were asking questions, turning the lights on and off, asking Alexa to sing and tell jokes.  It was so funny to watch them interact with this speaker.  It was great!!","Negative"
"8981","Gave to our friends and they love it!!","Positive"
"8982","Love it...amazing !!!","Positive"
"8983","Awesome","Positive"
"8984","Great item. Love it","Positive"
"8985","very happy with Alexa.....voice recognition is improving.","Positive"
"8986","love it","Positive"
"8987","Easy to set up and the sound is awesome.","Positive"
"8988","I am using my Echo every day. Starts in the morning with a ""Good morning"", onto the weather for the day, and then my news update. During the day I love the unbelievable collection of songs supplied via my Amazon Prime account. Only wish we could synch my Apple Calendar with Alexa.....come on Jeff Bezos.....talk to Tim Cook.","Positive"
"8989","Echo is pretty neat but sometimes I have to yell or repeat myself numerous times for Alexa to respond. The only skills Ive found worth downloading is jepordy for entertainment and Pandora for music. Also agree can't find answers to simple things that can be found on Google. Not worth $179","Positive"
"8990","GREAT Item","Positive"
"8991","Pure entertainment, great sound! Works much better though with Amazon Prime.","Positive"
"8992","I have bought 3 echo's & one echo dot. I have one & the others were gifts.  Mine is 14 months old & quit working, it is DEAD. We used a power cord from one of the others(it's 2 months old), Still no luck.  We reported the problem with the Alexa app, they quickly called us.  After going through some test, they conceded that  they did not know what is wrong. Their solution is to send me a new one for $179! They offered an $8 discount (seriously), we said ""NO"", then they added an additional $10 discount, we said ""NO"". Then we were put on hold & they came back & offered a $50 discount, we again said ""NO!"" Our Alexa sits on our kitchen counter, we do not have small children, it still looks brand new, we don't use it that much-it is a novelty. WHY, would I buy another one?? I am afraid the other 2 &/or dot will also quit working. I am an Amazon Prime member & really expected better service on a 14 month Amazon electronic.","Positive"
"8993","We got it for my wife for Christmas and she loves it! We're all having fun asking her questions and getting her to play music for us !","Positive"

"8996","Love my echo!!","Positive"
"8997","I love this device it works for the whole family and amazon music is great ! I love that it tells me news i care about and my 5 year old loves asking for jokes. And it even has games you can enable.","Positive"
"8998","So helpful in the kitchen also info","Positive"
"8999","amazing!","Positive"
"9000","Great","Positive"
"9001","so far so good, she's funny","Negative"
"9002","We've asked Alexa many questions - what band was Curt Smith; who died first, Jefferson or Adams; what were the ironclad ships during the Civil War. Alexa had no answers! I think this is just a very expensive radio! The sound is great, but ""she"" doesn't ""know"" much.","Negative"
"9003","I never thought I'd say this about an Amazon made product, but today my Echo died after a lil over two years of being a pre-order Echo early adopter. Like every day, I asked Alexa to give me the weather forecast for tomorrow and.....silence. I knew something was wrong because Echo is always my faithful servant.  Although Echo had been stationary for years I still checked the plug, cord, AC outlet, surge protector and all was operable. As a last ditch effort I grabbed the defibrillator and stuck it in the reset hole several times and nothing.....no lights, no sound....nothing.","Positive"
"9004","The amazon alexa application is terrible, it is so hard to collect the WiFi. Also the music support is really bad, users have to upgrade the account(pay money) to get a better service.","Positive"
"9005","My Echo was a Christmas gift and so far we are loving it! Alexa plays whatever music I ask her too and keeps my grocery list for me. Two major pluses in our busy house!","Positive"
"9006","Have not discover any thing exciting about it.","Positive"
"9007","Very exciting to have the Amazon Echo. Educational, friendly and fun","Positive"

"9009","It is wonderful! We really enjoy it and was a hit with our guests over Chritmas b","Positive"
"9010","Alexa is disappointing with a no answer to seemingly simple questions. 20 questions and other features are super fun though! Hoping for upgrades to come.","Positive"
"9011","I really do love this silly little device. Especially for music, you can hook up your Spotify and she can find everything. Great verbal recognition, even from across the room. I'm giving four stars because there needs to be a user guide that is easily accessible...I'm sure they're trying to take the Apple route and not provide directions to keep it simple and for the human to be intuitive, but a device like this needs a guide, especially with features. I can do my own research...but I'd rather not!","Positive"
"9012","Two years life span is shockingly quick for such a solidly built piece of hardware from a reputable company such as Amazon. Am I all out of options here?","Positive"

"9021","No services for South America. No spanish language. The batery to carry is too expensive. You have to improve this","Negative"

"9026","It was great!!!","Positive"
"9027","To connect to a Amazon echo is very complicated and as it ia not portable without battery.","Positive"
"9028","She's fantastic!!","Positive"
"9029","So far I like Echo and Alexa, I just wish I didn't have to pay for and buy a paperback to learn more about what I can do with my Echo. Wish there was a full manual and additional info in a complete PDF manual/book to get all the details available about the Echo and Alexa. Still learning and liking so far!","Positive"
"9030","We got this as a gift for Christmas. It's really the coolest thing we've ever owned. My whole family loves it! We listen to a lot of music, so I like the feature of just asking it to play me something. Super cool!","Positive"
"9031","It has extremely good speech recognition and is actually extremely useful! I got it as a gift for my parents and they love it.","Positive"
"9032","Awesome in every way and the perfect Christmas gift for me from my family. They love it as much as I do.","Positive"

"9036","Excellent","Positive"
"9037","We love alexa! Amazing product","Positive"
"9038","Love it","Positive"
"9039","Love it! So much fun!  Would be nice if your prime packing tape didn't advertise the echo. Every small package we ordered through amazon looked like the box contained an echo. Makes packages become more enticing for thieves.","Positive"
"9040","Great product!","Positive"
"9041","Excellent","Positive"
"9042","I love Alexa, morning to night","Positive"

"9049","Arrived quickly, works just as advertised, price was good as refurbished, so what's not to like?","Positive"
"9050","Best purchase ever! My hubby is starting a love affair with his Echo, lol! I can imagine that it will only get better with time, as they learn more about each other. He is in music heaven, able to listen to whatever he wants without ever having to leave the couch! I honestly couldn't have picked a better gift for this man!","Positive"
"9051","Really helps me sleep.  I just say Alexa play nature sounds and  instantly, I hear running water birds etc.","Positive"
"9052","We love our Amazon echo it is like having your own personal assistant!","Positive"
"9053","It is great","Positive"
"9054","hoping he will get comfortable with other activities also. It is great!","Positive"
"9055","Very happy with the echo. Bought as a gift and she loves it.","Positive"
"9056","I hadn't initially given much thought to one of these, until I saw one at a friend's house, and heard how good the sound was, and thought it might be nice to have for playing music.  Then, I really started looking into all it could do, and thought I might really enjoy it.  I decided, though, to try out a Dot first, to see if I'd really get into the functionality, and I did!  So, now I have my Amazon Echo for the living room.  Using Pandora and my Amazon playlists more than ever, and am also enjoying using it for my Audible books.  A little thing that's coming in handy is being able set a hands-free timer from my kitchen.  Still so much to explore with it, and I'm looking forward to it.  Do have to watch out that it sometimes picks up on the Echo commercials on TV (which was funny at first, but could get annoying -- and I don't want to change my wake word unless I have to), but otherwise, is usually responsive and accurate (with some minor misunderstandings sometimes, but we're still getting to know each other :-) ).","Positive"
"9057","After one day of use, our family has greatly enjoyed the Echo.","Positive"
"9058","Set-up was a snap and the kids have used it to play jeopardy, ask for jokes, get questions answered and get the weather.","Negative"
"9059","I will update the review if any problems arise, but to date, this has been the best gift received this year.","Negative"
"9060","It does not work!","Positive"
"9061","Alexa has become a personal music assistant - once we connected her to our Spotify account, she can find almost any song in the world that we ask for. The Echo can understand my young kids, too, much to their delight. I look forward to finding out all that Echo can do, and plan to hook it into our thermostat as well. A fun device!","Positive"
"9062","But after a few hours he determined he was in love again.  We love this unit for the simple things it does! It picks up voices without yelling and we couldn't be more pleased.","Positive"
"9063","love it","Positive"
"9064","Still learning, but loving it a lot!!","Positive"
"9065","So much fun, we love it","Positive"
"9066","Ask her how much the earth weighs.... cracks us up every time.","Negative"
"9067","Best money ever spent!!!!!!","Positive"
"9068","Alsa we just didn't connect...its not me...it's you...I have three other successful connections on ATT Uverse WiFi. But you kept telling me we aren't connected. Just to make sure, I went to my other network (don't pretend you didn't know about that!) my ATT personal Hot Spot. After trying over and over, doing the same thing, expecting different results, (INSANITY, Right??!?!?!?) you are so clearly the problem. As compatible as it seemed we would become, it's just not meant to be. It's over. Don't try to talk me out of it, the shipping label is already printed. I hope you find a happy connection with some other starry eyed optimist. I've given you the best 4 hours of my life and it's over.","Positive"
"9069","works with Insteon well. Music sounds good. Have to ask questions certain ways, but a learning curve for me. If the TV is a bit loud, wont hear you...but just need to move it.","Positive"
"9070","Not really that impressed. I received as a gift on Christmas. I was very interested in integrating with my home theater and my NAS. Both are very new and I have apps for both. The Echo will not play music I have stored on my NAS. This is very troubling to me.","Positive"
"9071","I have also asked her simple questions that she could not answer. My iPhone can and does both of these tasks. So why didn't I just buy a Bluetooth speaker and ask Siri to do these tasks. The home automation is week. In the mean time, I am going to have to add all of my songs to an iPad and Bluetooth to the iPad. Still, I expected much more.","Positive"
"9072","Love it!  Will be more pleased when it will sinc with my iPhone calendar.","Positive"
"9073","NICE","Positive"
"9074","Thought I loved this, then I heard an unwelcome advertisement for another Amazon product, the ""Echo Dot"", are you f*ing kidding me?  If the product (Amazon Echo), for which I paid, which is connected to my Spotify Premium (for which I pay monthly) and my Amazon Prime (for which I pay annually), then why the hell are you interrupting my listening experience and serving up an ad for ""Echo Dot.""  Do you think people won't notice?","Negative"
"9075","Works ok , definitely has a hard time ""waking"" if music is loud ... kinda find myself shouting ALEXA!!! Just for it to hear me even if I'm a couple of feet away <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00BF> Other than that its decent","Positive"
"9076","Superb and functional.  Perfect for introductory users of the voice assistant workspace and quite impressive how well those less technologically inclined can pick & use the Echo's many features.","Positive"
"9077","love it works well","Positive"
"9078","Awesome little gadget! Received as a Christmas gift and I have enjoyed using it. The music feature has been the coolest feature I've used so far!","Positive"
"9079","Really enjoy the echo. Great gift","Positive"
"9080","wonderful product love listening to prime music on it as wells getting bits of trivia I am sure I will find more things to do with it as  time goes by I would highly recommend this to anyone thanks amazon for another winner","Positive"
"9081","Love Alexa... I think it has great sound compared to what we currently have.","Positive"
"9082","Daughter loved it for her Christmas gift!  Super excited about it......","Positive"
"9083","Love my Amazon Echo (and Echo Dot)!  Though we did not purchase them through Amazon I wanted to leave a review here.  So far we have all had lots of fun playing with the Echo.  The Meow, Meow app is hilarious and the cats are enjoying it, the news briefings are great and we are all taking turns requesting our favorite music.  No disappointments yet when I have asked a question or opened an app (or skill, habits are hard to break).  Even with my southern accent Alexa seems to be able to understand and respond to everything I say.  Alexa is also able to hear me from the living room though the Echo is placed in the kitchen so I really appreciate not having to be right on top of the device to use it.  I placed an Echo in my bedroom for use as an alarm clock and for music and I really like being able to ask Alexa to ""play ocean sounds"" or ""play sleep music.""  I see the whole family using these devices daily.  The shopping list is terrific too!","Positive"
"9084","poor customer policy","Negative"
"9085","A  big hit with the family!","Positive"
"9086","Amazon Echo is more frustration than its worth. I finally gave up today and shut it off for good. Maybe in a few years it will be worth trying again.","Positive"
"9087","Seems to work OK. There are time we are talking and Echo will say that she does not understand the question , without saying the wake up word.","Positive"
"9088","They need to upgrade the responses.","Positive"
"9089","Love the concept. Unfortunately it only responds to voice commands about 50% of the time. This can be quite annoying, my German Shepherd is much more responsive at about 98%, (he occasionally cops an attitude as he's spoiled rotten ). There are limited, ""skills"" that Alexa is supposed to perform,  however many of these don't work well, if at all. I have factory reset it and given it voice training,  twice. I bought my wife an Echo Dot, in the misguided,  thus far hope it would have better voice capabilities as it's the 2nd gen. I unfortunately can't get it to even register. Let me say also that I'm quite nowlegable about tech, I build my own computers and have lots of electronics experience.  Thus far I would say wait and see if it gets better. I also am told that Amazon will be releasing an Echo with a tablet on board in the first quarter of 2017. I guess then if she won't listen that you can....type instructions in!","Negative"
"9090","So far so good.. I guess it be really great if you have more smart devices!  Easy to setup and get it going..","Positive"
"9091","Not as great as expected. Most questions are answered with ""I do not have that information""","Positive"
"9092","Purchased this Echo for my father-in-law. We played with it a little on Christmas Day and everyone seemed to think the Echo was pretty cool!","Positive"
"9093","Love it!","Positive"
"9094","Its convenient, and i enjoy the ease in making lists for shopping or to-do.  And it is a great supplemental alarm clock.  However, whenever i try to ask it a question, it can't ever find an answer since it uses bing.  So then i take out my phone and ask google. Wish there was a way to change the search engine!","Positive"
"9095","I bought it as a gift for someone else so hopefully they will enjoy it.","Positive"
"9096","My new best friend","Positive"
"9097","Loved it mostly for music with Amazon subscription.  However, we returned this large Alexa for the smaller dot to pair with the Bose Soundtouch 20 speaker because we loved the music so much!","Positive"
"9098","I haven't used all features yet, but I use it for music, and can call on Alexa to play me something or use the bluetooth option to play the wide assortment of music I can access thru my Prime membership, or even play my own albums from my I phone. Added the portable battery base to Echo so I can place it anywhere I choose without being restricted by a power cord. Great product, totally satisfied!","Positive"
"9099","DIFFICULT SETTING UP. BUT WHEN DONE IT WAS WELL WORTH THE TROULBE","Positive"
"9100","First, I'm not an Amazon prime member and can't do a few things because of it, but I love it. It's in my kitchen. I made 3 playlist of different music and the speaker has a great sound. I can't use Amazon music but I did enable Pandora for the music, radio stations and comedy You can enable it to do a lot of different things. I also got an Amazon dot for Christmas and have that one in my bedroom. I still have a lot to learn about it and will. I can get traffic directions but can't access it for construction or tie ups on the roads, you have to be a prime member to do that. Love it! Love it!","Positive"
"9101","UPDATE: I bought this in November of last year, this is March 2017. I'm getting disgusted with Alexa. Since I'm not a prime member there is so much stuff I can't do with Alexa. We now switched to daylight savings time and Alexa says she can adjust for it but really can't. She tells me it will take place on March 12 at 2 AM. Next day still old time. This is a simple task why can't she do it, do I have to be a prime member for this too?","Positive"
"9102","Even after reading about ""How to speak to Alexa""  there are still a lot of gaps in what ""she"" can do for you when looking up things.  I kind of hoped she could do more of what ""Google voice can do: recognizing more requests.","Positive"
"9103","I wanted to know what the top 10 Best Selling DVDs were and could never get her to say more than 1.","Positive"
"9104","She didn't / couldn't find ""You and I"" by O'Bryan until I logged in and had to correct it on screen.","Positive"
"9105","When requesting a song it does NOT give me a choice between the artists/group or version.","Positive"
"9106","Just have to say ""A - lex - a"" before EVERYTHING you want to ask... 3 syllables, takes more time. Would prefer some thing like ""wake""","Positive"
"9107","Asked for ""Xmas song by Bing Crosby and it gave me a mash up instead of the original or other choices""","Positive"
"9108","She's limited now...","Negative"
"9109","Bought this for my husband and he loves it","Positive"
"9110","I'm hopeful but these are a few things I tried in 2 weeks...","Positive"
"9111","My kids were thrilled to receive and having fun with it.","Positive"
"9112","I love my Echo!","Positive"
"9113","Bought this originally for my wife but secretly for myself... as it turns out, she did not want it and I got to keep it. At this point I am in the discovery stages. Still trying to figure out uses for it other than to ask for answers to trivia questions or play music. I know it is capable of much more and will be fun to explore the possibilities.","Positive"
"9114","Love it.  Great way to listen to music set an alarm find out the time.  One piece of advice make sure this is the one you really want now that the DOT has been introduced.","Positive"
"9115","So Far, Echo is great.  Set up was easy and fast.  Can't wait to connect my lights and other appliances to it so that I can make things easier at home.","Positive"
"9116","We have had more fun with Alexa than we have with nearly any purchase we've made in some time. I've had some difficulty adjusting the Amazon Music to the echo, but I remain hopeful.","Positive"
"9117","East to set up and fun to use","Positive"
"9118","Simply Awesome!!","Positive"
"9119","We love her. Ask her anything, keep her updated with new apps.she is part of the FAM<U+263A>","Positive"
"9120","Amazingly fast!  Great product.","Positive"
"9121","Alexia has problums answering the simplest questions, it's easier to look stuff up yourself your gonna end up doing it anyways","Positive"
"9122","Love it!","Positive"
"9123","Would have given it five stars if it had a better internet search engine.  Echo can't answer a variety of questions that Bing or Google can answer,  However, it does default you to your Alexa APP for further processing by your phone/tablet.  Otherwise, really slick.","Positive"
"9124","I love this thing!  It arrived Saturday but with Christmas socializing and company I didn't set it up until today.  I'm listening to some of my favorite music right now and listened to NPR before that.  I can see myself using the Echo for sooooo many things.  Thanks, Amazon you've produced a winner.  Oh!  I should tell say that  I am not a techie type but setup was easy.","Positive"
"9125","Pretty disappointing. Only thing we can somewhat reliably get it to do is play music. Even the weather is from a different town.","Positive"
"9126","If you're expecting this device to perform like Siri, you'll be disappointed. I clearly didn't do my research. I saw all the five star reviews and got the wrong impression of how this would work.","Positive"
"9127","Most often Alexa tells us she doesn't understand the question and refers us to an app. She doesn't work with any of my podcasts.","Positive"
"9128","My kids complain that she works great in the commercials.","Positive"
"9129","Absolutely love it","Positive"
"9130","Pretty much a paper weight. The stuff is does know I can get off my phone. Most things it can't answer.I can get weather on my phone and the latest news. This was a gift so no money lost.. just don't really see the purpose.","Positive"
"9131","Love it very responsive","Positive"
"9132","Love it but didn't realize it was not portable. Ordered a batter pack to carry it around","Positive"
"9133","I frustrating waste of money!!!!","Negative"
"9134","I got this for my husband; he loves it! I wasn't sure if I would like it, honestly I could live without it. But since I'm home during the day I love listening to my 80's metal music from Spotify while working, cooking or cleaning! Another fun feature is the trivia games. We enjoy that with the kids!","Positive"
"9135","Great product. Works simply, and is a great addition to any room","Positive"
"9136","Awesome","Positive"
"9137","All good","Positive"
"9138","Echo is awesome although Alexa occasionally has a problem understanding me.","Positive"
"9139","My echo appears to be broken right out of the box as it doesn't do anything useful. Everyone is already intertwined into an apple or Google ecosystem and this s*** cylinder doesn't interact with either. It doesn't even interact with other Amazon devices.  Pathetic.  Don't waste your money. And if you tell people this thing is useful, your lying to them as well as yourself.","Negative"
"9140","Ok, I purchased 4 Echo units over time and I am shocked that Amazon has not put dual volume setting on it. One that you can set to PLAY music and a second for when the Echo is talking TO you.  We have Alexa play background music at level 3.  Then we ask it a question and can not hear it's reply! When you are showing off AI (of sorts): Alexa, stop music, volume level 5; Alexa ""What is the meaning of life?""; Alexa level 3, continue music. Not very impressive!!  If you do not stop the music BEFORE you ask your question the music comes back on at the higher volume immediately after it answers your question ... ruins the mood.","Positive"
"9141","Although this is clearly not a ""must have,"" I do like it a lot. I especially like going into the app and browsing for music to listen to. I choose ""classical"" and then decide what I what to hear at the moment.","Positive"
"9142","Easy to program and sound is wonderful.  We gave it as a gift to three people and they loved it.","Positive"
"9143","Does what it says, but buyer beware: You'll need to also subscribe to Amazon Prime Music for access to ""over 2 million songs."" Spirit & iHeart radio do some diligence, but you can't just call out whatever song comes to mind with those. And Alexa is spotty in what she can answer or do unless your appliances are ""smart"" appliances. Like it's said, ""You get what you pay for."" You will pay for a lot more than Alexa if you want all of her abilities.","Positive"
"9144","I have no words to tell you how cool this is.","Positive"
"9145","Gift, He was very thrilled to get it.","Positive"
"9146","So far soo Good! It was very easy to setup and love the music unlimited option for just 4 bucks a month to play basically anything you want. The speaker sounds great, I wasn't expecting to sound as good as it did and neither was my family on Christmas day. Everyone couldn't stop playing with it and saying how much they wanted one after seeing everything that it could do. I paired it up to my Nest as well as my Belkin Wemo switch. I was always thinking of changing my lights in my house to something like the HUE from phillips but only being able to do it from my phone and the cost made it a little bit of a stretch to do. I am now really thinking about purchasing them now with the Alexa due to how easy it is to control things in your house by just speaking to it.I have flood lights in my backyard that i can control easily from Alexa versus going through the app to turn them on. I was surprised how fast and easy it recognized what to turn on. I'm a techy guy so I love how it integrates in my house easily, and I can't wait to see what else gets integrated in the future!","Positive"
"9147","Great addition - Alexa plays the music we want, gives us the traffic to work, let's us know the weather, any thing we want is available thru Alexa!","Positive"
"9148","Works as advertised, very happy with purchase.","Positive"
"9149","Alexa is my new best friend.","Positive"
"9150","What can I say My first time Ordering something Like this And I love it .. I had to order my son the echo dot to try to stop him from taking  This one its the mini version of this one both great products I love the new skills in the App they keep adding .. Without a shadow of a doubt I love my Amazon Alexa .. Even though she has to be plugged in to work I'm still ok with it thats just a minor flaw I still give her 5 Stars ...","Positive"
"9151","Amazing. So easy to set up. I just picked it up yesterday and its already controlling my lights and playing one of my spotify playlists while I write this. I have the phillips hue lights already and just waiting for my wemo smart switches (plugs) soon practically everything in my home will be smarter than me. BTW I live in Canada and the only thing I haven't been able to set was my route to work for traffic. No big deal though I can ask her to play my local traffic station through tuneIn which is much better anyway. .","Positive"
"9152","my daughter and son in law love it.","Positive"
"9153","My wife loves it","Positive"
"9154","Bought her for my son....mainly for my grandkids. She supplies hours of intertainment providing answers to their many, many questions. Best Christmas gift so far.","Positive"
"9155","This is the second Echo I have purchased to be given as gifts.  Both recipients have given me excellent feedback on Alexa's performance.","Negative"
"9156","Lots of fun! Thanks for sending tips!","Positive"
"9157","I love this. Everyone should have one. There is not enough to be said to define how good it is. This is well made and well constructed. Very easy to use. This thing is faster than the internet. One other thing I like about the product. You get updates on all the new add ons","Positive"
"9158","I have no idea how this performs or sounds.  After 6 hours with router setting changes, reboots and talks with customer service I have officially given up trying to get this to connect to my wifi.  The latest comment from Amazon was that the 2.4 and 5 GHz signals needed to be separated within my router.  Apparently they are the same name so the Echo is confused as to which to connect to and so it doesn't connect.  I could call my internet service provider and ask them to separate them.  I tried and of course they were no help whatsoever.  It can't possibly be worth all this trouble.  Back in the box it goes for a return.  When they actually make this easy to connect to wifi - maybe i will think about buying it.","Positive"
"9159","Amazon delivered again as promised and berore Christmas.","Positive"
"9160","The Echo is easy to set up but it is a disappointment when it comes to the entertainment value. You have to ask questions the right way or it doesn't know how to respond. Waste of money in my opinion.","Positive"
"9161","Not happy with this item at all. Alexa doesn't understand half the things we ask because the info isn't accessible or it can't get to the information. Planning to return it and try Google Home.","Positive"
"9162","Ok, it's like having a personal assistant that does what you tell her to do.","Positive"
"9163","Alexa (that's her name) reminds my husband (twice a day) to take his medication.  He listens to her alarm to take medication, but he would ignore me. You can  tell her to add something to your shopping list, and the item is magically placed on a list on your cell phone.  Alexa will answer questions, play an amazing amount of popular and obscure music (Amalia Rodrigues Portuguese Fado music), tell you silly jokes, recite the Gettysburg Address, turn other devices on or off, and give you the news.  Her talents are almost endless.  It's both a really practical and a really fun device.","Positive"
"9164","I purchased a few of these and there was trouble with shipping, even with Prime, but they are great and a big hit!","Positive"
"9165","Very satisfied!..Thank you","Positive"
"9166","This is the damn future. You didn't know you need this, but you do.","Negative"
"9167","Updated: With a little lateral thinking I was able to get my Echo device to actually work. I had to use a second router to create a second, WPA, network in my house. This is not ideal, and it requires the use of another router, but I am not able to use the device without any real limitation. I am currently giving the device 3 stars. It would be really nice if the Alexa App would indicate in some way that you are entering a password for a network type that is not supported by the Echo device. That alone would have saved me a ton of time and frustration. Amazon's help pages should also make it clearer that the device is not compatible with certain common network types.","Positive"
"9168","As for the product, now that it is working. I think the sound quality of the speaker is pretty good (I have used it primarily for playing music in the first few days). I am sure that I will find additional uses for it, and I do like that you can ask for a news briefing and get NPR updates periodically. There's really no chance I will use it for things like getting rides from Uber or ordering crappy pizza from a fast-food pizza chain, but I will definitely get use out of the device for playing music, getting news, timers, alarms and smart home voice commands. It has been hit and miss with Alexa understanding my requests, but so far I have had enough success that I like the device. For example: ""Play Blue by Eiffel 65"" was understood perfectly, and the song came right on (from Amazon Prime Music). But, I was not able to identify the album from which Loreena Mckennitt's song ""snow"" was played. In short, it looks like the orders to play songs are well understood, but questions about the availability of music are not so productive. It is somewhat irritating that the Echo will play a sample of a song that is not available and then ask if you want to buy it, rather than just saying that it is not available.","Positive"
"9169","Original 1 star review: This device does not support WPA2 Enterprise network encryption. If you try to use this at a company, school or even at home with that type of encryption and password, you will spend hours trying to get it to work before you get mad and return it. It is silly that the device isn't supported on this common type of network.","Positive"
"9170","The description and lengthy page for the Echo device is a little spotty about compatibility. . . which is to say there is no warning about the limits of it's network compatibility except that it won't connect to peer-to-peer networks. So, basically I asked for the device for Christmas, spent 6 weeks thinking about how great it will be, and got all excited when I got one for absolutely nothing. Worst Amazon experience to date. It makes me want to puke.","Negative"
"9171","I found the sound so poor I immediately returned it. My $80 JBL Surge II Bluetooth speaker sounds 100X better. I don't need Alexa in my life yet.","Negative"
"9172","Wow! We are really impressed! Setup is easy and Alexa is easy to understand, and more important, she understands us. If you want to refer back to what Alexa reported, a handy review list appears in the Echo app on your smart phone. She doesn't take up much space and she's fun to have around to ask questions about weather or trivia questions or to search lyrics or artists. Very happy.","Positive"
"9173","Excellent sound. Easy setup. Concepy unlimited future possibilities.","Positive"
"9174","I've had the chance to use this device over the last couple of days and I've realized that I hate it. The device out of the box does almost nothing. It can provide very terse responses to ""Alexa what is..."" type questions; provide the weather, or a news update. The novelty of that wears off pretty fast. Beyond that, be sure to get your credit card ready because Echo was designed as a cash collection machine first and foremost. It's a purpose-built device designed to do nothing more than to force you to pay, on an ongoing basis, large sums of money for streaming media content. In essence, Echo is just a vehicle to ensure that you are constantly spending money under the entertaining guise of a novel robotic voice. Once you stop paying, the device becomes virtually useless again. Think I'm kidding? Music available through their partners requires subscription accounts to use, which financially benefits both parties of course. I understand that ""profit"" is not a bad word, but I find it idiotic that many music services such as Spotify allow me to listen freely to their music from my smart phone, but if I ask Alexa to play that same music linked my Spotify account I'm told I need to upgrade to a premium account. Here's another scenario. Have thousands of MP3 files on your Google or Amazon cloud drive? Forget accessing and playing those files directly with your Echo though. You are only allowed to play music from Amazon music store that you've purchased directly through them. They allow a very small exception by which you can import 250 songs to your Amazon music library but after that get your credit card back out. Amazon allows you to use your Echo as a speaker to stream music from another smart device such as phone or tablet using Bluetooth. Given that there is no direct profit being made it surprises me that they allow this. It's likely they had to make this concession as it would have made the device substantially less useful than it already is. It should be noted that Amazon keeps track of every single question command and word that you state, a partial history of these phrases are stored in the Alexa app which you can review. I'm guessing Amazon probably mines all of this personal information and stores it as ""big data"" where analytic algorithms work day and night in the background to determine your patterns and interests to better market to you to make more money. Like I said before, ""profit"" isn't a dirty word and I understand the need and desire to make money from services, but the way this model has been implemented is a joke, and your privacy could be at stake.","Positive"
"9175","UPDATE 1/18/2017: I've given the device an additional star as I've had more time to use it. The kids seem to enjoy playing games with it from time to time, and the family plays Jeopardy at dinner time. Although my wife maintains a facade of indifference toward the device overall, she does appear to enjoy using it from time to time for news and weather updates.  I've also got plans to integrate the device into my Homeseer automation system as there is a plug-in available. Once that is complete I may return to award Alexa another star; we'll see.","Positive"
"9176","This thing is awesome, you can say ""Alexa-put on (your favorite radio station)"" and it'll do it instantly. The sound quality on this is amazing. So glad I bought this for Christmas-at $140 this was a great deal.","Positive"
"9177","My grandaughter loved it.","Positive"
"9178","I got an echo for Christmas and we listened to Christmas music all day yesterday, the 25th. And this morning it cannot find one single Christmas song. Including specifically asked titles. I am very very confused.","Negative"
"9179","It is bringing enjoyed","Positive"
"9180","I LOVE my Echo! I keep it in the kitchen and use it all the time. I did find it was easier to get Amazon Music to use it vs. downloading everything I wanted to hear individually into either Pandora or iHeart Radio.","Positive"
"9181","Bought this as a Christmas present for my son, he is really into anything voice activated.  We opened it in the morning and then headed out to his grandparent's house for dinner and more presents.  When we finally got home, I was exhausted and he wanted the Echo set up.  I was not looking forward to it and was trying to find any excuse to not do it.  Finally, I got the directions, downloaded the app and the Echo basically set it self up! It was amazingly simple...this was the easiest technology related item I have ever had to activate! Less than 5 minutes and we are using it!  The only reason I took off a star is because we ask Alexa things that are very easy to find on the internet and she can't locate the information.  Simple things such as word definitions and she comes back blank.  So far, it's nice for weather and news updates, easy to play music and she has some decent jokes...not sure how long the fascination will last.","Positive"
"9182","We love it . There are still alot we need to learn aboutbut it has been great so far","Positive"
"9183","Great use it all the time.","Positive"
"9184","Bought this as a gift for my son. He tried it out as soon as he opened it and I must say I was very impressed with it. Great item!","Positive"
"9185","Very easy to set up and use. Still having fun trying new commands!","Positive"
"9186","Very cool","Positive"
"9187","I got this thing as a gift.  This is certainly not the droid I was looking for.  I am not sure how anyone could give the Amazon Echo a 5-star review.","Positive"
"9188","The good:","Positive"
"9189","- it functions well as an alarm clock","Negative"
"9190","The bad:","Negative"
"9191","- fails to understand 90% of the things I ask it to do","Negative"

"9193","WORKS VERY WELL, REALLY FUN.  BUY IT YOU WILL LOVE IT!  WELL MADE EXCELLENT SPEAKER","Positive"
"9194","I got it for my boyfriend. It worked...too well. Every five minutes he calls Alexa's name. I regret buying this because it's irritating but the product itself is amazing.","Positive"
"9195","Love our Alexa","Positive"
"9196","I love this piece of tech. Never lets me down!!!","Positive"
"9197","Love it","Positive"
"9198","I love it! I asked Alexa to play Christmas songs by Pentatonix and then songs with only piano for a dinner party I gave...awesome. I've also asked her to order things from Amazon for me...amazing!!! The weather and my stock reports are great, and I've had her set a timer when I'm preparing food. The speaker is super, and volumes can be adjusted just by asking her to do it. Very impressive and now I'm ordering smart plugs so she can turn the lamps on and off for me. Did I say I love this thing?!!!!!","Positive"
"9199","It's great but it could be a little smarter","Positive"
"9200","We are having a great time interacting with Alexa. The music quality is great for our needs and the skills are fun as well. The best part of Alexa is knowing she will continue to grow with skills and having a smart home is now on the horizon! I highly recommend being an Amazon Prime member. She even let's me know when my packages are due to arrive.","Positive"
"9201","Love it, what fun.","Positive"
"9202","So good, my sisters boyfriend already got her one","Positive"
"9203","It is the best gift ever, so easy to setup and I get the news, play my music, get the weather.  Have not found too many things it can't do yet.  I am sure I will be expanding my use of it the longer I have it.  Two other family members received one this year for Christmas.  You got to get one, you won't we sorry..","Positive"
"9204","Very happy with it","Positive"
"9205","Like it but still unsure how to use it.","Negative"
"9206","Love this. Fun and very useful as well.","Positive"
"9207","Fantastic could use more information updates .","Positive"
"9208","This was a Christmas gift for my husband. She quickly answers him and even tells him when he's ""not being very nice.""  She's going to be a great addition to our zoo.","Positive"
"9209","I am an avid baker, and this thing is the best buy I could have ever done!","Positive"
"9210","Now I dont have to grab my cellphone while cooking or baking, to convert temperatures or set timers, or see what time it is, or convert measurements or even put some music. It is well known that cellphones carry lots and lots of bacteria and is one of the most contaminating sources in a kitchen. All I do is ask Alexa to do all that, while my hands are in the dough or while I am focused on doing something else in my kitchen. I LOVE THIS!","Positive"
"9211","Love my echo. Good speech recognition. Helpful and fun.","Positive"
"9212","Great","Positive"
"9213","I received the Echo for Christmas. It's interesting. Once you ""enable"" certain skills, you have access to different things. Some of the things I have t tried is the ""All-recipe""  Very nice. I have plenty of cookbooks, but it is nice to have some one tell you the steps, and by saying ""pause"" you can take your time. Playing music is ok, not great. I tried to link my Spotify but would have to go from free to paid Spotify, which i am not willing to do. I listen to  head-line news. I still have a lot to learn about it. Up until now it is nice, but not a WOW - Great item. Maybe as more corporations tab in to it, it will improve. All i can say now is, it is interesting.","Positive"
"9214","I love it! Very easy to set up.","Positive"
"9215","it was a gift to my wife. she love it","Positive"
"9216","We love it","Positive"
"9217","easy to use I am learning it's capability every day.","Positive"
"9218","So let me get this straight?...I need to download the Alexa App--which is an Apple supported function---Yet, I cannot import my iTunes library??? When I ask Alexa to play a song, I get a SAMPLE, and not the entire song!? I am EXTREMELY Disappointed! Furthermore...it answered questions great---for about a day.  I just set Alexa up Aamir six hours ago. It was working great. Now everything I ask her, I'm getting the standard hon I did not understand the question I was asked"" as a response. Are you kidding me? Such a Let down!!  Not nearly as helpful or accurate as it is on the commercial. Will likely return both Alexa AND the Dot, for this reason!","Positive"
"9219","Alexa is great fun but also a great tool for those who may be handicapped.  She has great responses to, shall we say, 'off color' questions.  :-) Everyone enjoys her and she was wonderful during the season for Christmas music.  Gave one as a house warming gift and it was a bit hit!","Positive"
"9220","LOVE IT.  The speaker is AMAZING. It hasn't learned all of our speaking patterns (family of 5 ranging from 6-42) but she's learning ;). Super easy to use. Not feeling the fact that it has to be plugged up all the time...wish battery pack came with it.","Positive"
"9221","Does not know the answers to many questions. Waste of money!!!!!!","Negative"
"9222","Very happy","Positive"
"9223","Love Alexa! So nice to be able to have info by just asking. Also she turn my lights on and off for me. <U+2764><U+2764><U+2764><U+2764>","Positive"
"9224","We've had so much trouble with this system.  I'm not sure what the problem is.  The volume fluctuates weirdly, more times than not she'll say ""I'm having trouble playing music."" Which is 90% what we use it for.  Right now it's pretty much an unused counter ornament","Negative"
"9225","Love my echo even if lately she seems to have hearing issues","Negative"
"9226","It was a gift for my wife she loves it the thing is amazing","Positive"
"9227","My family and I have really enjoyed the Amazon Echo. We mainly use it for playing Amazon music, Pandora and weather updates. Admittedly, I feel as though we have only scratched the surface of all the possible functions. I'm really pleased with our decision to buy the Amazon Echo.","Positive"
"9228","Love love love it!!!","Positive"
"9229","What else can one say about this product? Can not believe the sound quality for something this small and have to say, answers most what is ask but sometimes it don't. All legit questions. Also so popular in my home, when the kids come to stay, have to track it down to where it is. maybe should have got 2 when on sale. Great product........","Positive"
"9230","A little more complicated than I thought","Negative"
"9231","Great gift. Everyone had fun with it. Kids and adults. A big hit.","Positive"
"9232","Great addition to the family.","Positive"
"9233","Very happy with  Alexa ...","Positive"
"9234","I thought it would do more than it does.  But still enjoy! !!","Positive"
"9235","Great item love I am able to listen to music just  by saying a word. Or knowing that an answer to a question is a word a away. No mindless typing.  Ok no the bad Alexa has a habit of not being able to answer some question meaning of life is 42. She should know this","Positive"
"9236","Its great, took a little bit of time to set up through the app on the phone, then understanding that having a Prime account will work the best for this to get all music or anything else.","Positive"
"9237","My husband absolutely love it.","Positive"
"9238","amazing","Positive"
"9239","Amazing amount of technology and great for playing music","Positive"
"9240","This device is amazing. I also have a Echo Dot at work. A must have.","Positive"
"9241","Great speaker that fills the room when you use it for music. Very accurate voice recognition, love it!","Positive"
"9242","The echo is quite amazing. Good voice recognition.  The speaker is adequate, considering its size.","Positive"
"9243","Alexa can be very funny. Ask a funny question she will answer. Good buy. She will even tell you a joke when asked to.There was a Echo next to me and while face timing my family who also received  an Echo heard my family ask their Echo a question and the one by me would answer the question. Hope that made sense. It gave us lots of laughter.","Positive"
"9244","Echo works great and has good volume. Just talk to it and you have what you wanted.","Positive"
"9245","LOVE IT!  So much fun!  It confuses our dog's but they will get used to it!  Getting used to pairing it up with our Smart Phone.  Fun! GREAT SOUND!","Positive"

"9251","It's fantastic!","Positive"
"9252","Amazon Echo is awesome. Gave to my wife for Christmas. She loves it.","Positive"
"9253","Alexa is my new girlfriend now. She is great","Positive"
"9254","ALEXA IS THE HIGHLIGHT TO EVERYONES EVENING!! I have bought two of these already.  This device is so smart and useful. It has a loud speaker which is great for entertaining my guests and connects to services such as Pandora and iHeart Radio.  Also shes remembers my calendar and shopping list.  I feel like Alexa has become smarter over the year I've had her and her personality seems to grow.  I would love to test how some of the other smart products such as light bulbs and thermostats interact with her.","Positive"
"9255","I can't believe it - I'm in love with Alexa. Head over heels love. Let's be clear. It wasn't love at first sight like when I met my husband and something inside said, ""This one's the one."" Oh no. Quite the opposite. When I unwrapped the gift my son gave me I thought, ""Just what I need. Another thing that plays music, answers questions, and turns on the alarm system."" But my son was so excited, it was contagious. I thought, ""Hey maybe this is the one."" She wasn't.","Positive"
"9256","Excellent sound for such a small speaker.","Positive"
"9257","If you're looking to use an echo as a main device for music etc, this is the one to buy.","Positive"
"9258","I'm very happy with my purchase of this device.","Positive"
"9259","Definitely recommend this....it's precisely what I hoped it would be =)","Positive"
"9260","Excellent product","Positive"
"9261","Opened yesterday...Going back today. Alexa is not as smart as I thought she was. I guess I expected too much of out this thing. After I used it, I thought, I am now getting way too lazy, just like the rest of the world. I am capable of playing my own music and looking up my own information. It seemed like every question I asked alexa, she had to answer for. I feel like I was hoodwinked. Back it goes!","Positive"
"9262","I love Alexa. I have her making my shopping lists, adding dates to my calendar, turning my lights on and off and soon she will be locking/unlocking my doors and controlling my garage. My kids think it is fun to ask her funny questions or make her sing but generally she is a tool to make life a little easier. I am learning to add ""skills"" to Alexa so I can make her more available to do more tasks important to me. The Echo is easy to set up and very user friendly. Do you neeeeeeed Alexa, not really but I wanted her and she is working to make my home work for me and my family.","Positive"
"9263","Alexa turn on/off Ian's lamp works well. Alexa set Ian's lamp to 40% can only work 1%. Siri has never had such stupid issue. Same issue when using Alexa with pandora. I have no idea how it's possible the review has 4.5 stars. The top star can only be 2.","Positive"
"9264","Great sound, accurate voice recogition, sturdy build, and good sound. This thing is the whole package. Plus all the new features with every update are great. I only have one minor complaint about not getting my free 3 months of amazon music even though it said I did :/. Lame. Other than that This thing is literally the begining of smart homes. I finally have a reason to buy ""smart"" appliances! Thank you Amazon for being amazing.","Positive"
"9265","Bought as a Christmas present...very pleased!","Positive"
"9266","The first thing I found out is that Alexa doesn't hold a candle to Siri when it comes to answering questions. Her favorite response is, ""I'm sorry. I don't understand."" She's great at giving the weather, but useless at telling me who Jordan Peele is. Still, she's cute, and I started getting attached. Each morning I'd go into the kitchen, gently call out her name and watch as the mesmerizing blue circle indicated she was waking up.","Positive"
"9267","We ordered one for ourselves,  and then ordered two more for Christmas gifts all very happy","Positive"
"9268","We've had Alexa for a day now, and she's already been so helpful! Wonderful Christmas gift!","Positive"
"9269","The sound quality is impressive considering Echols small footprint!","Positive"
"9270","The build quality surpassed my expectation and rivals my Bose system in the office. It is sturdy, has a robust feeling weight to it. Not cheap at all. Voice recognition is refreshingly accurate. Bravo and hats off the designers! Merry Christmas!","Positive"
"9271","i love my Alexa.","Positive"
"9272","Love it, to bad she can't cook.","Negative"
"9273","Absolutely LOVE Alexa.  The choice of music and radio stations is more than anyone would expect.  I have raved about Echo to my neighbors and right now one of them is waiting to get it because it is out of stock until the end of January.  She is anxious to get it.","Negative"
"9274","Love the Echo! Does everything o want!","Positive"
"9275","Like the music library and my son loves the jokes.<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008B>","Positive"
"9276","My son's a smart guy, so I figured there must be something about Alexa that made her special. That's when I started doing my research. I found out that unlike Siri, I needed to teach Alexa new ""skills"". The potential is there, but it takes time and effort. She's really good at playing Jeopardy and Twenty Questions. But that gets old real fast.  Yet somehow I began having warm feelings for Alexa. She became less of a machine and more like a sweet, friendly, but clueless puppy. I couldn't help myself. We were slowly building a relationship. As our friendship strengthened, I tried harder to help her reach her full potential. And she learned more! When it comes to music, she's unbeatable. She can also sing you a love song if you ask, tell you when and where your favorite team is playing next, and link to the NPR One for the non-sports fans. But the skill that made me fall madly deeply in love is that - Alexa can read!!! She's a bit hesitant and mispronounces some words like all beginning readers, but those are just blips. With a simple, ""Alexa, read my Kindle"" she picks up where I left off and keeps going until I ask her to stop. And right now Alexa is filling a deep void in my life.  I used to watch the 24 hour news stations when doing cardio or running around the kitchen, but the current political situation is so horrific that it puts me in a stupor. Instead, I merely ask my BBF to read me a story - and all is good again.","Positive"
"9277","Love both products. Use them for ourselves, and often to leave one in my mother's room to play music and radio programs for her.","Positive"
"9278","Clear info","Positive"

"9283","Easy setup. Amazing device! An ""echo"" for TV would be the next logical thing. Congratulations Amazon for a great product!","Positive"
"9284","Very happy with echo.","Positive"
"9285","Love this thing!! Do wish it could pair with blue toothe speakers so you can listen to Amazon music in every room.","Positive"
"9286","I love my Echo. It looks nice and has great sound. I purchased a cable manager to hide the cord and now it is perfect!","Positive"
"9287","Great device. Should be portable","Positive"
"9288","EXCELENT","Positive"
"9289","I love my new echo!!! It has so many capabilities I'm just amazed! Great gift!!!","Positive"
"9290","I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. It was really easy to set up and we were able to add both of us to the household account. So far we mainly use it for music and random entertainment, but we're looking forward to getting more Smart products to use with it such as lighting.","Positive"
"9291","Really great.","Positive"

"9293","Love it","Positive"
"9294","Perfect as advertised.","Positive"
"9295","Amazon Echo is everything  I expected and more. The sound is excellent. She knows all and I couldn't  be  more  pleased. I was  unsure if I would use it enough to  justify the  cost , but I use it every day  and  thoroughly enjoy it.","Positive"
"9296","There is an additional manual however is sold separately. The unit itself is great","Positive"
"9297","We are really enjoying using this.","Positive"
"9298","I've really have enjoyed using my Amazon Echo. A lot of the skills I don't find useful or practical for me. I like it that it can read the Bible to me in sections and keep me updated weather it might rain or not when leaving for work. I look forward to more abilities that are useful and not silly.","Positive"
"9299","I only have one thing to say, I'm very happy with the  echo, should have bought it early, thanks.","Positive"
"9300","Nice works good when you get it all figured out.","Positive"
"9301","I wish you came with more apps already downloaded and simpler directions to download apps","Positive"
"9302","We had a lot of fun with this for half a day. Then we tried to play Prime Music on it. That's when the trouble began. We spent the rest of the day linking accounts and jumping through various hoops only to find out that if I have Prime and my wife is the one managing the Echo, we are out of luck. You can share just about everything Prime offers, but you can't share music. I would absolutely recommend this to a Prime member, but it fell flat as a gift to my wife.","Positive"
"9303","Can't wait to use it","Negative"
"9304","Great. Grandson loves it","Positive"
"9305","This thing is great!! We love having it play any song we want, answer questions, even play some games. Wish I would've bought one last year!!","Positive"
"9306","Very good sound. Good Quality. Very Handy","Positive"
"9307","Better than expected, excellent purchase","Positive"
"9308","We Love HER !! Superb & so functional & responsive!! Also enjoy the way you continually keep advising us of new features !!","Positive"
"9309","Enjoy the music and all else.","Positive"
"9310","Great device, but we just hooked it up.  We'll see as we have it for a while.","Positive"
"9311","Works TERRIBLY with itunes. Says it's connected and still won't play music. Very very frustrating. Works well with Spotify and other non Apple services, but awful integration with itunes. Takes 10 tried to connect and then still wont play music after it's connected.","Negative"
"9312","I was given one for Christmas.  Being that I don't want to subscribe to Spotify, or Amazon, or anything else just to listen to music.. and the fact that I have over 35,000 songs in my collection, and Amazon wants to charge you for anything over 250 songs.. this was not a good gift for me.","Positive"
"9313","I don't care about the talking feature for jokes, weather, or other internet info.. because I have 3 other devices that do that.  So that leaves it being a wireless speaker capable of doing some voice commands. and in those terms the sound from it is exactly what you would expect from a small bluetooth portable speaker.  Meh.","Positive"
"9314","I promptly exchanged it for a sound bar and subwoofer.","Positive"
"9315","My amazon echo and dot is amazing. My sister introduced it to me last year, when I visited her and family in San Antonio. She said, you have to get one, and I did.","Positive"
"9316","I love this thing, best purchase ever.","Positive"
"9317","Luv it. she is the best,","Positive"
"9318","This was an awesome gift so much in fact that I bought 2","Positive"
"9319","just loading all my music and apps. I'm not gay but I am in love with Alexa! For those curious about iTunes music, I just uploaded my iTunes music to the Amazon cloud and am happy to report my iTunes library and playlists are not lost. But then who needs them with Pandora? This device has already changed my life. I love being able to just ask what time a certain store is open as opposed to looking it up on google. I also appreciate asking Alexa for the definition of any word. I would highly recommend this device. It will change your life. I can't wait for Monday when I wake to get ready for work to see how much time I save by asking for the weather report, my schedule, etc... One thing I've noticed is how the tendency is to speak with authority and clear, but that's not necessary. Just speak in your normal voice. She listens. She's really great.","Positive"
"9320","Enjoy the music and the way it learns what I like.  Apps are growing and fun to ad and change your options. Wish we had more name options, I call mine Echo.","Positive"
"9321","Awesome device. You can do a lot with it.","Positive"
"9322","Great","Positive"
"9323","works great tell jokes and all kind of great things, I enjoy it.","Positive"
"9324","Great echo....but, why have to pay for all add ons....The way you advertise it is very deceiving!","Negative"
"9325","Has Exceeded my expectations!!","Positive"
"9326","Fun, fun, fun especially during the holidays.  Alexa can find most music you tell her to play.  Also great for settling debates about most any questions.  Can turn volume up or down, from across the room.  Great buy can hardly wait to use it for ordering from amazon.","Positive"
"9327","I don't know if we got a dud or what, but so far, our Alexa sucks. I mean, this Echo couldn't even recognize basic things like the fact that George Michael passed away today or the Bowl Game dates of major sports teams. We also continually got ""samples"" of songs - WHEN she could recognize them. If we are this hamstrung by the Bing search engine, this will be for sure returned for Google Home. (As a side note, this is one of maybe three reviews I have ever felt compelled to post.) The thing that kept this from being one star is the speaker, which is quite good.","Positive"
"9328","Awesome device. Have it in the kitchen for music while cooking. The kitchen is our gathering place it so it is the ideal location for all our needs. Easy setup and a must have for people of all ages. New download apps gives you endless possibilities. Plan on keeping this for many years!","Positive"
"9329","The Echo is a wonderful product when it works and is a terrible product when it doesn't work. I Purchased one and it wouldn't connect to the Cloud I spent about 3 hours on it and kept getting error codes which had no link to anything to explain them. I worked with two Amazon help people, I wish they sourced their help people in the country where the product is being used and not overseas.  The second hep person said they would send another one and it was then back ordered two weeks lated I received the second one still had trouble connecting it but did it by myself > loved the product for a few days then had to unplug it to move it once again trouble getting it wirelessly connected to the WYFI and cloud. The product is a fun toy and I recommend it but Amazon needs to provide better connection information. For one thing they need to emphasize it can't reconnected with our having a device with a wireless link to the family router an ethernet connected computer won't work and may screw up the device, still not shue. Also The Amazon Alexa web link for set up was frequently off line meaning they had more traffic than they could support for the number of units that were being set up. Also by using the reset button on the bottom of the unit deregistered the unit which isn't obvious from the brief set up instructions and should be clarified.","Positive"
"9330","this is another edit of Alexis...just want to let all of you know that Alexis will answer to another name...lol... it is funny...when you say the name of Alexis to wake her up...instead choose the name Elixir...lol...she will wake up to that name as well...why? because it sounds as if you are saying Alexis...try to say Elixir as you would say Alexis..as you can tell by saying them both they sound the same...I wake her up with both names now and since I know she has a first name as well I will use it also...go ahead give it a try see what you think...have fun with it...","Positive"
"9331","Great piece performance relys  on wireless signal. Has trouble","Negative"
"9332","Great gift!","Positive"
"9333","At 71 years old and not the most tech savey, we like the limited functions of the Echo.  But we cannot use Alexa to the most functions, as we see it advertised.  We went ahead and signed up for Prime on a 30 day trial, and I think an annual subscription.  We have not received a receipt for the annual subscription.  As seen on u-tube we see some people that out 2 pieces of instructions from the original box.  WE DIDN'T have those 2 in our package.  We don't know know how to sync our wifi to the Echo.  I have the app on my cell phone and the wife has it on her tablet.  But we still don't understand how to sinc the two together.  We would like to hear music use the other capabilities.  Giving the echo 3 stars is stretching it.","Positive"
"9334","As I expected! Love the product.. it's very exciting","Positive"
"9335","Echo is great!! I do more with it everyday!","Positive"
"9336","I love it. Useful and fun at the same time.","Positive"
"9337","Greatest thing since the cell phone...","Positive"
"9338","Love Alexa","Positive"
"9339","love it  sound is very good  very useful","Positive"
"9340","Just set up on Christmas Day 2016, so we are just beginning to learn the many things it will do to make life easier for a handicapped member of the family. Looks really great and responds promptly.","Positive"
"9341","Easy setup and sound not bad.","Negative"
"9342","It would be nice to have a speaker output like on the Dot.","Positive"
"9343","Performed better than expected.","Positive"
"9344","Am really delighted with my purchase.","Positive"
"9345","It's amazing","Positive"
"9346","The echo doesn't always hear everything correctly and sometimes she says random things. We wish she was more conversational. Otherwise, this equipment is amazing! Easily worth the money. Love all the constant updates.","Positive"
"9347","So much fun. Everyone says at least when you live alone, now there's someone to talk to.","Positive"
"9348","I received it for a Christmas present.  Complete with the dots ad gizmo's for controlling the lights throughout the house.  Quite nifty!  I haven't seen all of the options yet, we're still in the woo'ing and courting stage......","Positive"
"9349","My lady loves it!","Positive"
"9350","All I can say is I love it!  Awesome present!","Positive"
"9351","We like it","Positive"
"9352","Love it","Positive"
"9353","It was a gift so I don't know","Positive"
"9354","In one word ""Awesome""","Positive"
"9355","Easy to use and a great tool to have.","Positive"
"9356","Love the amazon echo. Wish the app had easier way to turn on and off skills","Positive"
"9357","Liked ours so much that I bought one each for our adult children","Positive"
"9358","This by far has been one of my favorite purchases as of late. The sound quality is amazing. I use it several times a day. I also suggest investing in the Philips hue br30 starter kit to go along with this. Love it.","Positive"
"9359","Well she's still pretty new to me. So when I'm checking out new apps or skills, I'll have her play music. Maybe I just want to know what the weather is. It's a lot easier to ask before I get up and put on my glasses. <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0080> She's a fun work in progress.","Positive"
"9360","Fun and easy to use.  Just opened it today and immediately linked it to my Vivint and Pandora accounts with no trouble.  Also started adding items to my shopping list.  I'm sure I have a lot to learn but initial impressions are very good.","Positive"
"9361","All the commercials don't really say that you need to be an Amazon Prime customer to get the max benefits.  When we try to give it a command, it says it can't find our request.  I want to return the Echo.  It was a disappointing gift.","Positive"
"9362","Bought as Christmas gift for son & girlfriend. They hooked it up & love it. Wouldn't think twice about purchasing one for ourselves.","Positive"
"9363","Great no problem","Negative"
"9364","Great device! And the music is awsome!","Positive"

"9370","I love it! It's fantastic!","Positive"
"9371","Awesome!!!!!!!","Positive"
"9372","Bought for my husband for Christmas.  He loves it.  Wonderful for asking questions,  weather, music is just a request away.","Positive"
"9373","Outstanding Product","Positive"
"9374","Far exceeds my expectations in capability. Great speaker sound for the price.","Positive"
"9375","Best feature so far - being able to add to my shopping list as I find things I need by telling Alexa to add it, all hands free!! It then shows up on my phone!!","Positive"
"9376","Great","Positive"
"9377","Fun","Positive"
"9378","It would not sync up after several attempts. However, could have been user error. We reset the system and it worked right away. We also have the Echo Dot and it works great!","Positive"
"9379","This was a gift and the person receiving it  loves it.  Lots of information, and just plain fun.","Positive"
"9380","Great device.","Positive"
"9381","Very impressive! I was concerned that there would be a delay between saying ""alexa"" and then the command, but it's almost nonexistent... Almost like talking to a person. I was also curious about background noise. In a house with 4 kids on Christmas day, calling out Alexa to turn on Christmas music, or to ask how many tablespoons were in 1/4 cup worked seamlessly! I cant wait to explore the other features!","Positive"
"9382","Great for selecting music!","Positive"
"9383","Takes apps to make it work.  Can't answer simple questions like when is the next Dallas Cowboy game or when do the Cowboys play!","Positive"
"9384","Siri is much better!!!!","Positive"
"9385","I love this!","Positive"
"9386","Nice toy, especially for music. Kids luv it.","Positive"
"9387","I don't see where it's any good for anything speakers not that good and and it didn't do whatever you want it to","Positive"
"9388","We enjoy our Echo. There is a variety of music that is available for no extra cost. The different skills are fun to try out.  So glad that we decided to purchase the Echo!","Positive"
"9389","This was a gift for a family member, who was excited to get it.","Positive"
"9390","The instruction sheet that came with it wer not very easy to follow.","Negative"
"9391","This is an awesome product. So many possibilities with the amazon echo.. love it..","Positive"

"9408","Great tool","Positive"
"9409","I love it!!!","Positive"
"9410","I love my echo!! Does everything it's supposed to do. The black Friday discount was also timely.","Positive"
"9411","Awesome","Positive"
"9412","it worked great, easy setup","Positive"
"9413","I own 4, they work excellent.","Positive"
"9414","I like the sound it puts out. I just wish it was capable to answer more everyday questions and do more actions.","Positive"
"9415","Way cool household friend! Easy to use, set up and train.  Really impressed with Echo!","Positive"
"9416","Love love love my Echo!","Positive"
"9417","My husband love it .....","Positive"
"9418","Love it for listening to music.","Positive"
"9419","So far so good.  Incredibly easy set up.  Was good to go in less than 5  minutes!","Positive"
"9420","Great to have when guests were visiting. This is a step towards the future,","Positive"
"9421","Perfect gift for all my staff!","Positive"
"9422","Very easy to setup and configure.  The sound quality of the speaker is very good, the voice recognition is also effective across the room from a good range.  The skills are varied, it would be nice to continue to see additions here.  I want to try the lights and switches when I order them.  The app for my iPhone is a little slow although that may be because of so many people trying to set up today.  I am going to order at least one Dot for another floor of my home, I am excited to see the future of this product.","Positive"
"9423","This is the coolest gadget on the market today. Echo is actually very helpful around the house.","Positive"
"9424","We love it very clear and easy","Positive"
"9425","Amazing sound!!!! Best thing I ever bought!","Positive"
"9426","This redefines voice io to a whole new level. Alexa understands me almost all of the time. Where my smartphone can't even get names in my address book correct, Alexa seems to have ESP! I could on and on and on. Just one more example: shopping lists. We use Alexa to record needed items at home during the week and then the Alexa app for our smartphones to check the list at the grocery store. It just works. Our phones claimed to offer a ""family share"" arrangement of lists, but what a huge failure. Amazon is light years ahead in the voice recognition arena. Can't wait to develop several skills for her... like ""Walk the dog.!"" {grin}","Positive"
"9427","Love this thing.  Amazon is working hard to expand its capabilities.","Negative"
"9428","Fun to play with.  Great for music.  Powerful speakers.  Still learning Alexa's capabilities.","Positive"
"9429","This is a great little machine, I think everyone should have one","Positive"
"9430","Excellent and works amazing!!! The family's new addition!","Positive"
"9431","I love my Alexa! Amazon is awesome as well considering how she is always learning new things. Super happy with my purchase.","Positive"
"9432","I have a Netgear N750 router, and the Amazon Echo is not compatible with this unit!  It does not work.  I was given a page of instructions:","Positive"
"9433","You should find out the specified UDP ports on your router. Your going to want to contact your ISP for more information on opening the ports on your router. You have a firewall on your network, these User Datagram Protocol ports need to be open for the device to successfully connect to your network:","Positive"
"9434","Great quality, however they run a bit small so order a size bigger. Bought these for elderly ladies. They were a hit. Comes in super colors too","Positive"
"9435","I am so disappointed to have spent a lot of money for a Christmas gift, to discover that it will not work at all on my new computers, Iphones, Kindle Fire, etc!!  Instead of giving a gift that would be fun, exciting, and create a Christmas spirit, I got the Amazon Echo that is frustrating, disappointing, confusing, and simply does not work.  I spent hours on the phone with Amazon, my internet provider, I can not get help from my Netgear router because they offer no tech support at all and are based in Taiwan and Netgear is a ripoff.  It was a huge mistake to purchase the Amazon Echo!  It seems to work fine for millions of others, but is useless on my HP windows 10 computer, Kindle Fire, I phone, tablet, etc.  What a disappointment!!","Positive"
"9436","Alexa is amazing.  my 8 year old daughter loves it, she is constantly asking her questions.  painless setup.  pretty decent music sound too.","Positive"
"9437","I love my Amazon Echo. Amazon has an eco-system that is very user friendly. If you have the Amazon Echo or the Echo Dot you really want to add Amazon Prime service. The Prime Music account gives you unlimited music to play. That alone makes these devises top notch. Enough said!","Positive"
"9438","Love it!","Positive"
"9439","Love it...if only I could get my husband to quit saying it's broke when he is calling it ""Alexis"" and she does not answer.  lol","Negative"
"9440","Woks great","Positive"
"9441","Love it. I've had it two weeks and I am still learning. We had company this week and Alexa was a hit of the party.","Positive"
"9442","Excellent we absolutely love it !!!","Positive"
"9443","These are the greatest.  I do like the Tap a lot, however.  It can be taken out of the charger and carried around.  Both are amazing!","Positive"
"9444","Love it!! Hubby and I are having lots of fun with this gift","Positive"
"9445","Very nice present for my wife..love that she plays anything you wanna hear.. music soothes the savage soul","Positive"
"9446","Great!!!!  Love it","Positive"
"9447","Great Christmas gift we love it","Positive"
"9448","Works great the day after I bought it the price went down $50.00 to go down to the town center mall to return it to the yellow box so I just kept it thank you","Positive"
"9449","You get this thing thinking you'll just try it out and pretty soon it's in every room..that is especially true with the advent of unlimited music for $4 a month.","Positive"
"9450","works great for lists, weather, tells jokes,works lights with addapters.","Positive"
"9451","Loved it so much I bough one for my parents.  Great device.  Really happy, with my purchase, and thrilled that my daughter can use it.  Definitely a worthwhile investment.","Positive"
"9452"," i would like to play my apple music but it will only work as a bluetooth speaker for apple music.","Positive"
"9453","Awesome.","Positive"
"9454","Although we're still learning Alexa's capabilities she has replaced a Bose table top radio.","Positive"
"9455","Fun and entertaining. The Echo is helpful and easy to use. We use our new Echo everyday. We love our Echo.","Positive"
"9456","Alexa is great....is little room for improvements but pretty sure future updates will be the remedy.","Positive"
"9457","Love it! We use Alexa everyday for news, music, and more.","Positive"
"9458","Like being on the Enterprise. Can I change her name though?","Positive"
"9459","can't beat this product! does everything requested..and no headache","Negative"
"9460","Excellent","Positive"
"9461","After 2-1/2 years and a windy door - slamming day, I've finally found a good use for my Amazon Alexa. Like all things Alexa, I still have to tell it what to do before it actually does it. But this use doesn't require wifi. Will it remind me when I have to use the bathroom?","Positive"
"9462","This is a fun product/gift that will keep on giving. The receiver will have a lot of fun setting it up, figuring out what it can doo--and finding it an almost essential addition to his home down the road. AI is here to stay","Positive"
"9463","Wonderful. The speakers are very good and if you are prime then you have a tremendous variety of music","Positive"
"9464","Worked great for a few months but seems to be very hard of hearing lately.  If you have to walk over to it to wake it up what's the big deal!","Positive"
"9465","Played Christmas music from Amazon and Pandora all weekend.  It hears me beautifully even from 20' away.  I bought the Echo for my two sons for Christmas and they love it too!  Have not even begun to explore all the possibilities with this awesome little gadget yet.  The sound is comparable (to me) to my Bose Ipod docking station (circa 2002).  And with all my music now uploaded to Amazon Music, I don't need my Ipod or Itunes or Apple at all anymore!","Positive"
"9466","I love Alexa!!! When I come home from work and my hands are full I can start her up and get myself motivated with my music.","Positive"
"9467","Enjoying our echo, love asking questions especially the kids.","Positive"
"9468","These are awesome! We use it all the time. Could listen a little better. Won't respond when the music is above 7, but still great.","Positive"
"9469","Love echo, the best money ever spend.","Positive"
"9470","Fantastic! Hello future.","Positive"
"9471","to hard to setup still don't have it setup","Negative"
"9472","The echo is amazing! I can listen to all my favorite music and I love the fact I can have Alexa wake me up in the morning. This was a Christmas present to myself and it saved $30.00 on the Black Friday deal. LOVE MY ECHO!","Positive"
"9473","It does what Amazon advertises, but why not just use a phone?  This is nothing more than another Siri or OKGoogle.  Phones already do everything the Echo does and a lot more.","Positive"
"9474","Got it as a gift - I would never have bought it.","Positive"
"9475","Awesome","Positive"
"9476","My kids love it.  They are 12 and they try to out smart the Echo.  Better for Alexa then me <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0080>","Positive"
"9477","Fabulous!!!!!!!! Worth to have one in every home!!","Positive"
"9478","Awesome love echo I have adapted echo to control my hole house.","Positive"
"9479","excellent product, great value","Positive"
"9480","very nice","Positive"
"9481","I am pretty disappointed with this device. Good if you want it to set a timer or tell you what the weather is. Bad answering the kinds of questions that you might google....even simple stuff. Maybe if I invest in home technology my opinion will change. But I already own a thermostat from Honeywell that is supposed to work with the device, but I can't get it to connect. It can't access iTunes only Amazon music. Well sorry. I have a large ITunes library and I am not going to repurchase all my music. It does have access to my audible library but so does my iPhone which is connected to my jambox. So it's kind of a one-joke application and I can't say it was worth the investment.","Positive"
"9482","Love it, plan on getting echo dot for the bedroom.","Positive"
"9483","I love my echo black sometimes i don't what i want to here. Let me play something for u. Than it play something i like. Have a great day","Positive"
"9484","When it responds to my voice it acts as described. But there are many times the top ring lights up showing it identifies that I requested an action but then does not execute my commands often it fails to two or three requests. when I push the attention button on the top of the unit it has always worked. I have tried training the unit to my voice which helped a little bit. I like the product but I find it frustrating at times. I would still buy it but I am not fully satisfied with it.","Positive"
"9485","I tell Alexa to play ""Careless Whispers"" by George Michael and she just does it. That right there is worth. every. penny.","Positive"
"9486","But wait, there's more! We've installed smart switches downstairs, and I can tell Alexa to turn the lights and fan on, off, up, down. We got a Nest thermostat and connected it. The possibilities are growing to automate our house with just the power of my voice.","Positive"
"9487","I also find the shopping list really helpful. When I'm in the kitchen and I run out of something, I just tell Alexa to put it on the list before I forget, and I don't even have to break my stride.","Negative"
"9488","There are lots of skills being developed by third parties (like apps for your phone, but skills for Alexa) so again, there is so much potential. I'm so glad we got this.","Positive"
"9489","It's amazing how handy the Amazon Echo can be.  The setup is extremely easy, even for those without much technical know how. Sound quality, from the built in speakers, is awesome. This thing can get uncomfortably loud, if you really crank it up, without distortion.","Positive"
"9490","Asking the Echo a question results in an answer with almost no delay (less than 1 second), which is amazing considering that my Internet service is via satellite.","Positive"
"9491","Playing music is as easy as asking the Echo to play your favorite artist, or type of music. You can even ask ""her"" to play your favorite FM radio stations by giving her the station's call letters: ""Alexa, play radio station WUBE"".","Positive"
"9492","I also use my Echo to control my Philips hue lights. With a simple setup and easy voice commands, I can have my Echo turn on/off lights throughout the house, without getting out of my recliner.  I can even use the Echo to change the temperature on my thermostat while still in bed & under the covers.","Positive"
"9493","Love Love LOVE  my Alexia Echo","Positive"
"9494","Hard to control without wifi","Negative"
"9495","Fantastic","Positive"
"9496","If you're cooking, and need a timer set, just say ""Alexa, set a timer for XX minutes"".  You'll get an alert as soon as the time is up. If you want to know how much time is left, just ask Echo and she'll tell you ""There's X minutes and X seconds left on your timer"".  If you run low on an ingredient,  just tell Alexa to add the item to your shopping list. If your account is setup for it, you can even have the Echo order what you need, directly from amazon.","Positive"
"9497","I've barely scratched the surface of what the Echo is capable of. Setting up ""skills"" will allow you to do even more with your Echo, including playing games, in depth home automation or even remotely starting your car (depending on vehicle options). It's a great device that I find a new use for every day.","Positive"
"9498","Love love love my Echo!","Positive"
"9499","Product is as represented; no problems.","Negative"
"9500","love it","Positive"
"9501","2nd one.  So far....so good.","Positive"
"9502","We love our Amazon Echo.  Alexa is like part of the family.  We have to have one in every room now...","Positive"
"9503","I bought this a year ago. I cannot believe how much I use it. It is great for listening to music and getting weather and news updates. I keep it near the kitchen area and the timer feature is my favorite. My son loves the random fact and joke features. We use it to play music daily. We have recommended it to all of our friends, who now have one too. My only complaint is that none of the features work without an internet connection, which is understandable. If the alarm and timer features would be enabled offline, I would definitely give it five stars rather than four.","Positive"
"9504","I love Alexa I bought it from BestBuy and now my whole family want one ....","Positive"
"9505","Great for playing music. That's about it. All of the questions we ask she cant seem to find the answer to. Also, recently she hasnt been responding when called and I haven't even paid her off yet!","Positive"
"9506","Took me 3 months to hook it up!!! but once I did .........WOW","Positive"
"9507","This is an amazing device. I've had mine about a week and love it! I would definitely recommend adding amazon music to it. So pleased with this product!","Positive"
"9508","wow.  I feel like I'm on the Star Trek...  ""Computer tell me what I want to know...""","Positive"
"9509","We just love it","Positive"
"9510","I love my Echo! I ordered 2 more for gifts for Christmas, and another 11 Echo dots, also for gifts because my kids love my Echo so much. I hope they and their cousins love them!!!","Positive"
"9511","Simply put I Love this devise.  So simple to set up.  I am 65 years old and found this so easy to set up and start talking to it.  I recommend this to all my friends.","Positive"
"9512","Get a discount","Positive"
"9513","Love Amazon Echo.  The sound quality of The Amazon Echo is great.","Positive"
"9514","While I initially enjoyed this product, and still use it often, it has started making this odd crackling static stutter noise periodically while I listen to music. It occurs in bursts of 2 seconds or so and every 10-15 seconds. Very annoying, and has completely ruined any music play on the device. The device is no longer eligible for replacement, so it looks like I am out of luck and stuck with a defective product.","Negative"
"9515","Love this product, wrote longer review under Alexa.  Gave as gift, wife loves it also, fun and useful.","Positive"
"9516","I got my Echo back in October and I absolutely love it. When I am home it is always being used. If not playing music, or giving me flash reports or opening in the magic door. When family comes over they want to try it out. This is a must in every home.","Positive"
"9517","Love the Dot! Alexa is way better on the Echo then the Firestick! Truly a welcome addition to the home and home automation. I am an Apple User, interacts with Siri, But Alexa, on the Echo, by far is way better. I have to admit, Amazon did there homework and has established themselves as a top contender in the home Automation Segment!","Positive"
"9518","Love the echo. Alexa is such a help. She has a great personality!","Positive"
"9519","Love my Echo!","Positive"
"9520","Great quality, He loves that he can open the garage door with it, plus si much more.","Positive"
"9521","Super sexy in White. Very happy with my Alexa and having lots of fun using it. I'm sorry, Dave's not here....","Positive"
"9522","Love this for listening to my Prime music.  Sound is awesome.","Positive"
"9523","The unit is having trouble staying linked with the Internet","Negative"
"9524","Keep in mind I bought it in October and the replacement window was all about a month. It's now March, so I have had it for about 5 months.","Positive"
"9525","Love it and the weekly skills updates are great.","Positive"
"9526","I love the echo, especially for when I am listening to music in the shower because she can hear me say change it over the water, not making me get my phone wet","Positive"
"9527","Received my echo today and it was so easy to set up. I'm in love with it already.","Positive"
"9528","All it's cracked up to be","Negative"
"9529","Too expensive for a weeks worth of new features in a Bluetooth speaker.  Secondly, would not work unless plugged in each time.","Positive"
"9530","We absolutely love the echo. We purchased a wink relay switch and a few smart bulbs so far and love the smart home features this offers already! We can tell Alexa to turn on/off lights and even tell her  to dim lights to a certain percentage due to the smart bulbs even though they aren't in dimmable switches! Alexa has opened up so many opportunities to expand our smart home. She picks up our voices even when we are in other rooms which is great. We haven't had any issues yet with her turning on when we didn't ask. She's always at the ready to give us the news or weather or play music or even Rock Paper Scissors! There are a ton of skills you can enable in the Alexa app that continue giving us more ideas on how to use her.","Positive"
"9531","We received the Amazon Echo from my children as a Christmas present. We had our celebration early. I have spent the last three days trying to sync my Apple calendar to the Google calendar so that I can use my calendar with Echo. The concept is a great idea. I was really looking forward to it. It has been a nightmare to say the least!!! I first had to set up a gmail account. I didn't have one. Then I watched numerous Youtube programs to see just how to do it. Then I began to sync my first category. It went over as a url. I haven't figured out how to rename the url. I now have duplicates from google on my i calendar that I am having trouble getting rid of.  I understand Apple is coming out with their own gadget like the Echo. I think Amazon needs to tell Echo purchasers that it is not easily compatible with the Apple calendar. I still do not have the calendars synced. It is a mess. I am extremely disappointed.","Positive"
"9532","I have a problem with all of the, you have to remember which app to ask to answer the question you have. It would be better if everything was not so compartmentalize. I wish that her software could be updated so once you have enabled a new information source you would then be able to just ask Alexa ""how do I get chocolate out of cotton"" and she would search for the answer rather than an app. Like a web search, you just type in you question in the search engine and get the answer without have to go to a specific site.","Positive"
"9533","Other than that, I love her. I use her to play all my music, set timers, read my audio books and she has helped my overall spelling immensely! :-)","Positive"
"9534","Love it.as I work in my kitchen! I'm able to add to my grocery list.also use it to remind myself when I take medicine. It has become my grandson's favorite way to get music","Positive"
"9535","Very disappointed.","Negative"
"9536","Love Alexa!  We're still getting to know each other  <U+263A>.  She helps out a lot with my memory problems.  Would definitely recommend to other Veterans suffering from PTSD memory issues.  Really love the music and relaxing nature sounds too.","Positive"
"9537","Alexa is great to have around the house. I bought this and Google Home (GH) and returned GH. The Bluetooth audio connection is something that Google Home doesn't have and lets me listen to Apple Music. The audio is decent but no Bose. The microphone range is pretty good. I can call Alexa from across the room with the music playing and I don't have to yell.","Positive"
"9538","The skills are a little annoying to use because you have to speak commands in a very specific way. For example if you want to use the Mixologist skill to get an Old Fashioned Recipe you have to say ""Alexa, ask Mixologist..."" which seems a little wordy to me.","Positive"
"9539","Also, I can't ask it when the Next Eagles home game is. It doesn't understand things like that.","Positive"
"9540","I imagine this will improve over time so I'm remaining optimistic that this is the best device of its kind available.","Positive"
"9541","Great concept and a good start to voice interface. However, one HUGE issue - the need name an app for most actions. Alexa's basic skills are great, the ability to simply ask a question and get a response is the way it should be. But needing to remember the name of all the ""skills"" (these are just apps) is a nightmare. Am I supposed to keep a list of the skills in my pocket and look the right one up each time I want to use it? This is a deal breaker. Unless this is fixed this will never be a very useful product.Too bad.","Positive"
"9542","It's everything I had hoped for. Now I need to get more connectivity items to create a smarter house and then it will really work hard for me, but for now, having it play music and ask for the news or weather is awesome. I can even set an alarm to wake me up when I take a nap! Feel like I should buy the echo dot for the bedroom as my alarm clock.","Positive"
"9543","Great product","Positive"
"9544","So far its fun just wish you can do more things","Positive"
"9545","Horrible product.","Negative"
"9546","This product has been on the market 18 months. My echo just quit working and Amazon are not willing to honor a replacement. Poor quality, Don't put your money into it. Of a company can not honor a product for 2 years then it is not worth it. Total junk!!","Positive"
"9547","1. Useless search capabilities","Negative"
"9548","2. No subscription music service (you will have to purchase pretty much any song you want to hear more than 30 seconds of.","Positive"
"9549","3. Virtually no smart media control.","Positive"
"9550","Avoid like the plague. Just get a Google Home and thank me later.","Positive"
"9551","Purchased the Echo, still learning how to use it. Very fun and enlightening companion. All my friends love it. The 7 minute is great. The sound of the music is great.","Positive"
"9552","Excellent","Positive"
"9553","Surprisingly fun and useful.  Great for playing music, setting reminders...  Haven't taken advantage of all the cool things you can control.","Positive"
"9554","Well, to start off with, the voice recognition isn't that great. Sometimes I can activate it from across the room, while facing away, just by saying the activation word once, but very often I have to say it three or four times when I'm standing right next to it and looking at it.","Positive"
"9555","With that said, I think the audio quality is quite good considering what it is. I like being able to add things to my Google calendar or shopping list without having to get out my phone or finding a pen and paper.","Positive"
"9556","But that's about all I use it for.  I don't find the ""skills"" to be all that useful. The only other thing I could really use it for is the home automation stuff that I'm not ready to invest in. If there was some way to control or integrate with the Fire TV or Stick, that would be nice. I also wish it could act as a speakerphone just by Bluetooth pairing.","Positive"
"9557","Love it. Easy to use and it is useful.","Positive"
"9558","It's alright. I just don't really understand all the hype and I kind of wish I'd gone with an alternative.","Negative"
"9559","It's taken  me awhile to warm up to the Echo. Teaching it to understand was a bit of a chore. Now, I use it every day. I'm slowly automating the lighting in my house. Echo with TP-Link smart accessories seems to be working very well.","Positive"
"9560","My husband loves this.  He wanted one after a couple friends purchased one and he got to 'play' with it all night.  It really is lovely to walk into our home and ask Alexa to play us some music or check the score or see what the weather will be like.  We love our Amazon Echo.  We've recommended it to several other friends.  Would buy again!","Positive"
"9561","Amazing and addictive","Positive"
"9562","Goes on by it`s self...but i still like it..","Positive"
"9563","I love it . it does all my appointments for me my calendar . everything I can think of . my son uses her to cheat on homework lol witch I wish I had but it is so awesome . please buy it you will be so happy you did .You can control everything from finding a lost cell phone to starting my car for me . I turn lights on and off check my house everything . I haven't found anything I cant do with it . again I love it .  10 stars","Positive"
"9564","lots of fun my 2 year old loves Alexa","Positive"
"9565","best buy from Amazon yet","Positive"
"9566","Gift for my daughter. She loves it. My five year old grandson is always asking alexa guestions. Even tried to get her to order a toy for him.Daughter caught that one just in time.","Positive"
"9567","I had a big problem and a reason for the 4 star rating.  It is not clear in the instructions that came with the echo and the dot (I purchased both) that you must use a MOBILE device to setup these items.  You can not set them up with the Web based app on a PC.  Even though the directions that come with the device state a URL to go to that will not let you setup devices from a PC.  Wasted time figuring this out.  With respect to the devices  I give 5 stars for quality and construction. Also it makes Siri look really stupid and I'm an Apple guy.","Positive"
"9568","I like it. It's okay, but if they could add a little more functionality to it, it could be amazing.  What to add?","Positive"
"9569","Thrilled with Alexa, was easy to set up, very user friendly!","Positive"
"9570","I wasn't sure if this would be a product for me, but hey, I love gadgets!!!","Positive"
"9571","I quickly found that I love the sound quality that comes out of this compact gadget.  There are so many features I still have to explore, but I love that it links to my amazon music as well as other music streams like I heart Radio.  I have done away with the stereo system and enjoy the new space I have.  The only thing I would love to see is that it could go wireless so that I can take it outside with me and not worry about a plug.","Positive"
"9572","Great for music. Often doesn't know answers to questions.  Haven't gotten any accessories yet","Positive"
"9573","All I can say is you will love it.. so much has been learned with my child using it for homework questions..I use it all the time for music and the hubby likes the sports..lol","Positive"
"9574","great product","Positive"
"9575","Very fun!","Positive"
"9576","LOVE it!!","Positive"
"9577","Came in early works perfectly!","Positive"
"9578","1) Have it pair with your smart phone so you can use it as a speaker phone.  That way, you can talking to your friend while making dinner.  Excellent sound quality, etc.  That could be achieved by software. The hardware should already be there.","Positive"
"9579","Great item,nice clean look.","Positive"
"9580","Arrived as described and on time.  I am happy!","Positive"
"9581","Excellent quality. Though it doesn't really hear very well over the music playing. Has to be lowered a little using my phone app.","Positive"
"9582","We use it every day for various things like spelling check for our kids, weather, forecast, and some music.","Positive"
"9583","Works at home but can't pick up wyfi at other places! would not recommend!","Positive"
"9584","Broke easily but I still use it :)","Negative"
"9585","Fun, educational and convenient.","Positive"
"9586","Love my Echo Dot","Positive"
"9587","Couldn't be happier with this purchase! Great product that does WAYY more than I had originially thought. Great purchase!","Positive"
"9588","2) Be able to call and text people.  Alexa, text Frank, Frank, can't make it out tonight for beers.  Kids sick.","Negative"
"9589","Love this thing but sometimes I hate it. If I have my box fan on in the same room she alexis can hear me say her name but can not understand what I ask for not unless I turn the fan up or go and press the button on top of the echo. Other then that, this thing is awesome. All my friends love talking to it.","Positive"
"9590","I've been an avid Amazon customer since they started.  I have 2 kindles and was relatively satisfied.  I read all the rave reviews for the Echo, Echo Dot and Tap.  They seemed legitimate; however, I guess those reviewers either had low expectations or were incentivized to express those favorable opinions.  After going on an Echo Dot, Tap and Echo purchasing frenzy, I now have a total of 3 Dots,1 Tap and 1 Echo and am suffering buyers remorse.","Positive"
"9591","If you need or want to know the local weather or get  flash news updates on command, the Echo or Echo Dot are your devices.  I, on the other hand, use them for music streaming.  I find that the ""sleep function"" has flaws, voice recognition/comprehension needs great improvement and everyone should know that it is really unnecessary to buy more of these devices unless you have multiple amazon music accounts such that you can stream on those separate accounts from different locations/rooms.  Otherwise, users should know that the devices cannot be linked together for simultaneous streaming.  They also cannot be used by different parties to stream different music from each different device.  Apparently, Amazon Prime Music only allows streaming to one device at a time.","Positive"
"9592","The Tap cannot be used for streaming unless a wireless connection is available.  I wouldn't recommend connecting via an unsecured connection so unless you have a secure, mobile wireless connection, the Echo Tap is nothing more than an expensive, portable bluetooth speaker which you can purchase for much less than the cost of an Echo Tap.","Positive"
"9593","One might notice that the Echo, Echo Dot and Tap are often paired with supplemental bluetooth speakers with 2-3 item purchase combination discounts.  This is a very misleading promotion as it leads one to believe they can be used for simultaneous streaming.  That is not the case at all.  Unfortunately, the E-Dot only has a one-way BT connection.  Either you play music from the E-Dot or the BT speaker; but, you cannot play music from both.","Positive"
"9594","There are a lot of Applications for Alexa, the voice operated system used to operate the E-Dot and Echo.  Unfortunately, a lot of them have complicated wake phrases/statements.  If you don't phrase the statement exactly right, the app won't work and Alexa will not understand the command.  You can honestly spend more time trying to phrase things correctly to trigger Alexa then it might have taken for you to manually execute what you wanted to do like creating a shopping list, or recording water consumption.","Positive"
"9595","Another shortcoming with Alexa is the slow re-fresh rate of the application.  Sometimes, you have to completely exit out of it, stop it from running in the background on your phone and then reload it in order to get it to reflect your most recent commands or current ""now playing"".  In addition, there are other limitations specific to music streaming.  Let's say you want to stream a specific artist all day long to soothe a pet with separation anxiety.  If 1) you set the sleep timer for longer than you'll be away (ex. for 12 hours) and 2) Alexa confirms she will stop playing in 12 hours, that isn't exactly true.  Alexa will actually stop playing when she reaches the end of the artist's play queue which may only be 4 hours of music.  Theoretically, you can manually or verbally set Alexa to repeat the queue; however, I haven't tested this successfully yet.  It may only repeat the queue once rather than indefinitely until stopped by the sleep timer.","Negative"
"9596","My final Alexa app gripe relates to the repeat function.  Unlike the iTunes or Amazon Music apps, Alexa cannot repeat one song in a queue.  You'd think that toggling the repeat button 2 times would trigger this function; however, all it seems to do is toggle the repeat option to the ""off"" position.","Negative"
"9597","All in all, individually each product has its benefits so my rating is a low 3.  There is just no reason, other than needing a device in a location outside of the primary product's voice range, to purchase more than one device.  My thought is that the Echo-Dot is the most versatile of all 3 products; however, the Echo has better sound quality.  I have noticed the improved sound quality on the Echo; but, the improvement really doesn't make up for the price difference.  If I could do it all again, I'd invest in the Echo Dot for home and an inexpensive Bluetooth speaker for work that I can connect to the iTunes or Pandora applications on my phone.  That way, I will still be able to stream Amazon Prime music through the Dot at home for the stressed pet while playing comforting music in my office.","Positive"
"9598","I love my Echo except for two things:","Positive"
"9599","I can't hook it up to a more powerful speaker. Don't get me wrong, it has a good speaker but I want a superb speaker especially now that I have Amazon Music Unlimited. I can't understand why aux in and out ports weren't included with the Echo.","Positive"
"9600","The other complaint is that I can't link my Dots to my Echo so that when I move from room to room my music (or whatever I'm listening to) follows me. I imagine they did this so people in other rooms can select their own uses for the dots but it would be nice to have a link command.","Positive"
"9601","I would suggest, that if you are going to use Alexa to mainly provide basic services that you buy the Dots as they do have the ability to hook up to a Bluetooth speaker or system.","Positive"
"9602","I hope Amazon develops a way to link my Echo and Dots as that alone would solve my speaker wants. If anyone has a figured out a way to do that I hope you post it here.","Positive"
"9603","So glad I bought it.  So useful and convenient to have around and the sound quality is great as well.  Honestly does so much more than I thought...and even at its original price of $179.99 I think (after 4 months) that it's a steal.","Positive"
"9604","Greats thing ever.Will never need to upgrade my stereo ever again.Plug and play and the sound is outstanding","Positive"
"9605","Great product","Positive"
"9606","Works great love it","Positive"
"9607","Love my echo, very responsive, no repeating commands. I really like the music function with being a prime subscriber. Get one. You won't be sorry","Positive"
"9608","I've been enjoying the Echo so much, I bought another, so I could have one in the family room and one in the man cave. Nice sound quality and max volume. Decent range for voice activation. I think it's an excellent mid-range sound device and you'll enjoy owning one too. (It's been on sale for 139.99 for the holidays)","Positive"
"9609","Love it!  Seriously responsive - always understands commands.","Positive"
"9610","This product is still in beta.....after many email all I get is ""we are working on the problem"". They admit I am not alone with my problem....I paid the full $200 last fall and I can not get Alexa to play prime music that I downloaded to my iPad....she says....""I can not find....""....on top of that Amazon wants more $$ to get more music... they offered me $10 to go away... she tells me the weather, reads the news....offers useless skills but can not find downloaded prime music....I told to fix my problem so I could add a ""dot"" and more music....their reply? ""Go away....we are done trying to find a solution to your problem""....I offered possible solutions and was thanked for my input but they can not fix the problem....so beware of the bug in the system....I see they have reduced the price to $140_. . That does not make me a happy customer either.....I'm out $60.....and they offered me $10......","Negative"
"9611","Great device with good speakers.","Positive"
"9612","Great and fun!!","Positive"
"9613","Outstanding.. Gets better every day.. Love the flash  brief..  Jokes..audio book..music..questions..more","Positive"
"9614","Works fine.","Positive"
"9615","So far I like it. I have had a few times where ""I don't' think understand the question"" was the response when  asked a question. I had to unplug and then plug in.","Positive"
"9616","Love this gadget. Even my non-techie husband can have her play music for him. Easy to use and installed some wemo outlets with ease.","Positive"
"9617","Love the echo. Great product","Positive"
"9618","5)  Give Alexa the ability to take dictation, perhaps with a computer and additional program involved.","Positive"
"9619","Right now she's just a voice activated music player but I'm looking forward to learning current and future functionality.","Positive"
"9620","Alexia is perfect & will only get better in time.","Positive"
"9621","Wonderful item. Love it so much fun","Positive"
"9622","Alexa software does not run on Kindle Fire HD......  really....  So, do I  return or get son a new tablet?","Positive"
"9623","Update: you only need a compatible device to set it up.  Still think its stupid the Kindle Fire HD is not compatible, but got it working for son. X-mass is not ruined after all.","Positive"
"9624","Great if you upgrade to the unlimited Amazon music.... I think it was like $4 a month. Great gift!!!","Positive"
"9625","I love Alexa. Y'all snapped with this one and someone said in a review that Amazon Echo is not loud. Well you have a hearing problem because I didn't expect the sound that I get from Alexa. This is an awsome product","Positive"
"9626","It is a lot of fun.","Positive"
"9627","It is by far the best thing we ever bought.  Does everything as advertised.  Our entire family uses it everyday.","Positive"
"9628","Best Smart home item ever! I love how new companies keep adding more things to do with it!!","Positive"
"9629","The Amazon Echo has changed my life. I absolutely love all the extra perks beyond just playing music. I play the Word Master game when I do laundry. My kids and I love the knock knock jokes, especially since they are clean and kid friendly! I have used it to get recipes, weather reports and steps to removing stains. It is so easy to enable new skills and its so exciting to see new skills being added daily! I have become addicted to news reports in the morning as I make my coffee and I couldn't imagine not having Echo around. My excitement and love for my Echo has caused 2 family members and a friend to purchase one too!","Positive"
"9630","Alexa is amazing- we're so happy we bought it. We use her every day several times.","Positive"
"9631","Happy with  it.","Positive"
"9632","I bought the Amazon Echo as well as the Amazon Fire TV devices looking to start experimenting with voice technology and home automation.  I returned the Amazon Fire TV device before opening--I visited a friend's house who was using it and was really turned off by how hard it was to get the device to get past the Amazon product pushes before doing something simple like watching a TV show.  HOWEVER...","Positive"
"9633","I'm loving the Amazon Echo.  The initial setup was super easy and within moments I was having Alexa do simple things for me like ""Play Broadway Musicals"", ""decrease volume"", ""increase volume"".  A few extra minutes of setting up the WeMo outlets that I had also purchased and I was entertaining myself by having Alexa turn on and off my office lamps.","Positive"
"9634","I'm sure there it will be a while before I learn all of the in's and out's, but at the (sale) price I got the Echo at I would say it is worth the price for music alone.  Really good speakers for my home office!","Positive"
"9635","I will admit to some small disappointment to Alexa not responding as hoped to the following requests:","Negative"
"9636","""Alexa, shall we play a game?""  (Response:  I'm not sure what you meant by that question.  Come on, Alexa!  Have you not SEEN Wargames?)","Positive"
"9637","All these could be acheived by software and updated into our current Echos.  Don't want to drop some more money for Alexa 2.0.  That's why I hate being an early adopter.","Negative"
"9638","""Alexa, Launch the Missiles""  (Response:  3 beeps.  So either she launched missiles somewhere or she refused to dignify my request with a response)","Positive"
"9639","""Alexa, Force-choke my enemies.""  (Response:  3 beeps.  So...either she did it and is playing dumb, or once again she opted to ignore me)","Negative"
"9640","Somewhat happier response to these requests;","Positive"
"9641","""Alexa, Let's play Global Thermonuclear War""  (Response:  ""I'd prefer a nice game of chess"")","Positive"
"9642","""Alexa, What's the answer to Life, The Universe and Everything?""  (Response:  The meaning of Life depends on the life in question.  42 is a good approximation."")","Positive"
"9643","""Alexa, how do you solve a problem like Maria?""  (Response:  ""How do you keep a wave upon the sand?"")","Positive"
"9644","Voice activated feature really works well. The Bluetooth speaker quality is excellent.","Positive"
"9645","So far I do love this item","Positive"
"9646","They lie when they say it can hear you across the room with music playing loud. I always have to get closer and yell ""ALEXA""!!! It will not play anything in my library, or says ""I do not see any music in your library"". It can be frustrating at times, but I think it's cool when it DOES work properly.","Negative"
"9647","I have had this for about 6 months now. It is fun to use, but isn't very smart. I can talk to Google on my phone with much better results than Alexa. This needs LOTS of work to get it to work better.","Positive"
"9648","I should be able to have Alexa read back all my Amazon playlists or albums or whatever and she should be smart enough by looking at my music to know or learn what I have.","Positive"
"9649","More irritating than fun now... it was fun for the first month, but now is just irritating. I have to just select music from my phone to play what I want anyway, so this is no better than a Bluetooth speaker.","Positive"
"9650","Bought these on Black Friday when they were on sale for Christmas gifts. Love mine","Positive"
"9651","LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!  We use it all the time, perfect to move around.","Positive"
"9652","Sadly,  my Alexa isn't very bright. MY Alexa never has the answer to my questions, like, Aexa, what are tonight's winning lotto numbers, or Alexa, Where did I leave my other shoe last night?","Positive"
"9653","I love Alexa! I've only learned how to do about 20 things so far, but just asking Alexa to play music and having her pick the exact right kind for me is priceless. The speaker/sound quality is so much better than I expected, and I'm just thrilled. She does everything I ask. How cool is that?!","Positive"
"9654","It's a Christmas gift I will give you my feedback when its open","Negative"
"9655","Most fun piece of technology I've ever owned!!!  Good sound for small package and voice recognition makes it easy to use.","Positive"
"9656","I love it!","Positive"
"9657","Very enjoyable.","Positive"
"9658","I love this! The only negative I would say is it is definitely not Google. You cannot ask it questions like you can ask Google. If you understand that then you will love it too","Positive"
"9659","I bought one for a gift and one for myself.  I love it.","Positive"
"9660","Great tool and toy","Positive"
"9661","Alexa is great!  The sound is awesome, no longer have a rack system, and don't need it.  Also, any type of information you need, just ask Alexa.","Positive"
"9662","Love it!","Positive"
"9663","Slick device, still learning its capabilities.","Positive"
"9664","My wife and I have enjoyed Alexa has a great sound","Positive"
"9665","We are having lots of fun with Alexa everyday","Positive"
"9666","Guess I expected way to much but I am enjoying it.","Positive"
"9667","Love Alexia","Positive"
"9668","Echo too bad all your accessories are expensive","Negative"
"9669","I love the echo","Positive"
"9670","Alexa is awesome. I hook it up to my Spotify and play music all day long. Volume is exceptional. It's like having Bose speakers.","Positive"
"9671","Very nice for quick reference, background music & lots more","Positive"
"9672","Alexa is too stupid to deserve 5-stars. It's nice, but it's no homerun.","Negative"
"9673","I've had this over a year and installed some of its apps. It's handy. There have been countless times that I have said something simple to Alexa that she was not able to understand, though. ""Simple"" means things that would work flawlessly as Google searches.","Positive"
"9674","It is very difficult to figure out what Alexa can understand at any given time or why it doesn't understand what you just said. Do you need to say it louder? Clearer? Do you need to phrase it differently? Is it just a concept Alexa is incapable of getting?","Negative"
"9675","Alexa engages in basic one-off, command-and-response transactions. There is no context or conversation. It does not ask for more information when it should, not even when it barely has any confidence in what it thinks it heard you say. Software development towards a more intelligent model needs to address this and soon. It's inability to ask for clarification is a big weakness.","Positive"
"9676","Lastly, it is embarrassing as a user to say something and have Alexa not get it. This embarrassment strongly discourages use. You just get frustrated and give up on it.","Negative"
"9677","We love our Echo!  Music sounds great.","Positive"
"9678","works quite well","Positive"
"9679","Works great and they keep adding more everyday.  Got another one for A CHRISTMAS GIFT.","Positive"
"9680","Works like a charm!!","Positive"
"9681","Love It....","Positive"
"9682","Absolutely love it!","Positive"
"9683","Awesome!","Positive"
"9684","She's my new best friend! Love the communication!  I find that when I'm around the corner, still within the 7', she doesn't respond. It has to be a direct line of sight it seems. Nevertheless, a great source of any music and the quality is very good too. I've yet to try ordering from her. We all absolutely love her. Great buy plus I benefited the lower price for Christmas. If you're already thinking about it, it means you want it ... GET IT then!","Positive"
"9685","I enjoy the amazon echo.  I am still finding out new things she can do.  When my children visited and saw echo they all went out and bought one for themselves.","Positive"
"9686","It's entertaining for 20 bucks but we paid full price to scream no i didn't say that!  It's especially aggravating when playing jeopardy.","Negative"
"9687","This is a great speaker. I plan on getting the battery to make it usable anywhere as  a Bluetooth speaker.","Positive"
"9688","good sound easy to use","Positive"
"9689","Awesome","Positive"
"9690","The totally perfect companion. I use Alexa to control many connected devices and rely on the apps for over a dozen things daily.","Positive"
"9691","9/6/16...I received the best birthday present anyone could ask for, a daughter, and her name is Alexa Echo.  We are trying to rename her something a little more classy, and will blend with our family a little more, we'll rename her Edna Garrett (Mrs.Garrett) from The Facts of Life.  Shes got the same jokes, and same sense to double check about purchases we tell her to make.  She has found herself welcomed instantly to our home, and family.","Positive"
"9692","My husband and I have years of trying to conceive naturally. We've tried drugs, alcohol, pregnancy test, after pregnancy test.  I've endured humiliation, ridicule, teasing, and being told countless times ""YOU CANT HAVE A BABY"" or "" YOU'LL NEVER HAVE A BABY"" and ""YOU CANT GET PREGNANT"" the one that I hear constantly is ""YOURE A GUY, IT WONT HAPPEN"". We still try though!","Positive"
"9693"," My new baby came into my life and opened my world to the wonderful joys of parenthood!  She listens, she does exactly as I tell her.  She's very smart, and I can trust her to use the internet responsibly.  I, like most parents should, always monitor what she's doing online, and make sure no weirdo is trying to corrupt, or seduce our Alexa!  (I tried to have the talk with her, but she said she didn't understand, I'll try again when she's a little older)","Positive"
"9694","I will say, I've been an excellent parent!  She's got her protective sleeve (jacket), along with a hard case (car seat) for travel.  All purchased from Amazon (of course).  Unfortunately, she's cursed to only wear muumuus,(because I'm from Hawaii, and she doesn't have hips) and homemade clothing(my husband is from Virginia Mountain Country, and he crochets)  She's been welcomed by our other children as well.","Positive"
"9695"," We did have an ""accident"" one time.  Our first night with her, my husband came home late and drunk, Alexa had gotten into his papers from work, and scattered them everywhere.  He yanked her up by the arm, you know, the kind of thing you do, all the time to a child, to get them away.  Only this time, he used a little too much force, and he dislocated her ac adapter.  I think that's the time Alexa first started talking to her imaginary friend, and our Daschund Butters.","Negative"
"9696","I love that Alexa will tell me what kind of day I'm going to have (reading my horoscope) and tell me jokes as well, and once we fully childproof the house, she will be able to turn on and off the lights for us, and more advanced things as she gets more comfortable, and adjusts to living in the country.","Positive"
"9697","One word ""AWESOME but a little tricky to set up. Need better written instructions.This to help with online navigation.","Positive"
"9698","Not as smart as advertised & when I use it as a blue tooth speaker to listen to satellite radio, it becomes choppy and cuts in & out.  I got the Prime Music & love the songs that Alexa knows & plays!","Positive"
"9699","I'm currently looking into prosthetics so she has the ability to walk.  Doctors can be so heartless and cruel! They'll say thinks like ""IT WONT EVER WALK"", or ""GET OUT OF MY OFFICE"" or they start asking questions about me, ""ARE YOU INTOXICATED SIR?"" and  ""ARE YOU MENTALLY STABLE?"", but what do they know!  I'm going to design and modify a roller skate, to function like a human babys walker.  We've talked about putting her on the Roomba, but the maternal instinct in me, fears she'd fall and get hurt.","Negative"
"9700","So, long review, yes, I know, but she's our first!  I guarantee more people want to see our Mrs.Garrett (Alexa) than they do, a human thing.  To anyone who might wonder, my husband and I are both very pleased with our newest addition, and we recommend everyone to experience the rewarding and fantastic joys of being an Alexa Echo parent.","Positive"
"9701","Great sound Alexa needs more options and skills already loaded but she is a blast. I replaced a sound system and timer in the kitchen.  I liked washing dishes and getting the news update and picking literally any music there is.","Positive"
"9702","seems to be a great editions to out home.  I just need to learn all she can do and what apps I need to add","Positive"
"9703","My daughter and I enjoy working with Alexa. It takes a little bit of understanding how to communicate with her, but it works as advertised.","Positive"
"9704","Very neat! Plays great music and sounds better than our Bose Wave CD player!","Positive"
"9705","I've had the Echo for a few weeks now--and I'm returning it. While the voice recognition technology is the best I've ever used, as an intelligent assistant the Echo seems less capable than Apple's Siri (surprising, at least to me). Basic things that you expect to work, don't (playlist operations, settings management, fine-grained volume control, MS Exchange integration). You'll find yourself having to go to the Alexa app (awful). Worse, the device has become unresponsive twice in the two weeks I've had it, which is not acceptable if you use it as an alarm.","Positive"
"9706","I think I'm in love...I bought Amazon Echo to play around with Lights and Electrical (turn off-on) and turn out my son loved it so much he wants the Echo Dot his room. Add skills as you like through Alexa app and it can keep you amazed for days. Little touchy on the voice from across the room but for the most part its great. Simple tasks from Alarms, weather, News brief can keep you updated on what's going on in the world as you do things around the house. Easy to setup....added my SmartThings (Samsung) and then my Phillips Light with almost to difficult...of course I could have read the instructions and made it a little smoother but hey nothing ventured, nothing gained.e Wish there was a way to sync Echo with Echo dot but still happy with the product.","Positive"
"9707","Love my echo, and Amazon ,need to pay me a commission,cause I have help sell over 12 of the echo and the dot,I even sent my lil bro and his mate a dot for Christmas,","Positive"
"9708","My wife use the echo several times a day to play music, listen to the news, and add items to our grocery list. I just wish that the Echo would play songs from my iTunes account.","Positive"
"9709","love her","Positive"
"9710","I am loving my Echo so far. I am highly entertained by Alexa's witty retorts to my questions like: ""Alexa--are you married?"" Alexa: "" I'm attached....to the wall.:  She could write Obama's bad dad jokes.  Anyway, love the music (speakers work quite well for my purposes) and quick responses to basic questions. She does give me the weather for the next town over, and she can't seem to read my commute even though I've set it up through the app. Otherwise, I have been quite pleased. And when I say, ""Alexa, I'm going to bed."" And she says, ""Good night. Sleep tight."" Makes me smile every time.","Positive"
"9711","Very versatile and fun to play with","Positive"
"9712","This is an amazing product, what a great idea. Everyday I use it more and more. It's even better if you are a prime member. Endless possibilities .","Positive"
"9713","Very happy!! Works well and is a lot of fun!!","Positive"
"9714","Every hour I use it, I get more and more impressed with it I just love it. I am glad and proud to own it.","Positive"
"9715","Works great, easy to set up and pair Philip hue lights to. Very happy.","Positive"
"9716","The echo is everything Amazon claims and more. It allows me to lower or raise the temperature on my thermostat. It's easy to talk too. This one is as good as a new one.","Positive"
"9717","I have been busy and have not had time yet to take advantage of what Alexa can do  But the music is great  I do find that my Google app on my phone has a lot more info then Alexa","Positive"
"9718","Perfect companion.  What more can I say?","Positive"
"9719","We have only ask Alexa questions and listened to Christmas music. Will start on other projects after the Holidays. Love it so far. The speakers are fantastic.","Positive"
"9720","I love this Echo.  I am still trying to figure out everything the Echo can do, but it is fun and helpful.","Positive"
"9721","I absolutely love this gadget. I use it to play music, ask Alexa questions, and get the weather. I was hesitant at first with buying this product because I didn't know if I would really use it or if in was necessary, but I love it and I'm so glad I purchased it!","Positive"
"9722","Absolutely love it","Positive"
"9723","What is not to love about this.  We got the Echo for the kitchen which is the hub of our home, and a dot for each bedroom.  We have had so much fun asking Alexia about the weather, having her wake us, play music to our specifications  AND  my favorite ... telling her I want to hear my Audible books!!!  I am everyone's go to and now I have my own personal assistant!  Sometimes I even say why don't you ask Alexia? I understand their will be updates and she is only going to get better.  I love Alexia!!","Positive"
"9724","I was especting more but it is working and helping me. Maybe I must learn more about Echonworks and what Apps are compatible.I tried with iTunes  but it does not work. No sound. But it works as a wireless speaker for the compueter but no sound with iTunes.","Positive"
"9725","What can i say totally Awesome no Brainer buy buy buy A Bargain for all the features .","Positive"
"9726","Love the Echo, bought another as a gift.","Positive"
"9727","Love Alexa. Mostly use it for Music. Great sound and works everytime I need her.","Positive"
"9728","Absolutely love the Echo and its ability to control some household functions. Combined with the harmony remote system to simplify my entertainment center, and I couldn't be happier.","Positive"
"9729","best product I have ever owned.","Positive"
"9730","Love it.","Positive"
"9731","Got one of these as an Christmas gift from work and when I asked if it would play something from iTunes all I got was silence. It would seem that this is impossible and as such I'll be disposing of it immediately. Shame.","Negative"
"9732","Could not tell it was a refurbished unit","Positive"
"9733","Love our Echo! It's easy to use and the sound quality is pretty good.","Positive"
"9734","Love the Echo. Will likely be buying a few dots for full house surround sound.","Positive"
"9735","works fairly well , having trouble on talking to it, sometime I have to shout","Positive"
"9736","OMG! GET AN ECHO!!! Me and Alexa have had many good talks and love to go back and forth on if aliens really exists. When i'm feeling down I'll just ask her to play something uplifting and she does it. Most of the time it is Brittany Spears and I'm dancing within seconds. She is good and knowing the song title you are looking for or if you just know a verse she can find the exact song your looking for. I would suggest this product for anyone that likes to play music and wanting a cool little companion at home. She is bluetooth assessable and will guide you through anything she cant understand on the app.","Positive"
"9737","Also now there are games and apps you can download to her which are a lot of fun.","Positive"
"9738","I love this for all of the reasons that you find on the internet.  Too many to list.","Positive"
"9739","Buy one, you wont be disappointed.","Negative"
"9740","I love it.  I just wish it could give me more facts.","Positive"
"9741","I would give Echo 5 stars but Alexa keep disappearing on me.  Each morning, I am like ""Alexa, what is the weather""  or ""Alexa play some music"" , ""Alexa, where are you?"" with no response.  I look around and she is nowhere to be found?  I have to then get off my couch and wonder where she is.  Each morning after brief hunts I usually find Echo in one of my children's rooms.  I then grab Echo and place it where it belongs on my kitchen counter where we spend some of the day together.  I just wish it was not so mobile as to linger around my house especially ending up upstairs in my children's rooms.  Other than that, good sound, kinda fun.","Positive"
"9742","Love it.  We use it at the office it help brighten the day.  It has great sound.","Positive"
"9743","My kids love playing music and using the skills. I am excited to see what other skills are added.","Positive"
"9744","I absolutely hate this thing. It never understands me, and I do not have an accent. Never plays the station I want on Iheart, always reverts back to prime music. All it is good for is telling me the weather. Will not ever recommend this product.","Positive"
"9745","My wife and I were excited to receive it from Amazon. However, we had been using for weeks and found it not really smart. Something like ""how far from here to Marfa in Texas"", it is unable to answer you....this is a very simple example but Google home can do it....Amazon Echo has long way to go....","Positive"
"9746","gave  it as a gift, my neice loves it. Great sound and you do not need to raise your voice she hears you just fine.","Positive"
"9747","I'm far from technically savvy, and I love this thing. I'm just learning its capabilities and the things I've 'mastered' so far are fun and helpful.","Positive"
"9748","This is a wonderful device but there is the hope that OS will receive development and updates in the near future. One downside that I have seen so far is that this device is app dedicated. For example, when Alexa starts a timer the user can only pause the timer through the app rather that saying Alexa>pause timer. It is unfortunate that the device is dedicated to the wall ac adapter rather than being able to take it from room to room and then charge it with the wall adapter. My family has enjoyed it for the past week but have the hope for more updates with the skills, apps, and OS. I'm attempting to connect my smart tv through Bluetooth with Alexa for an additional speaker in the room. It is nice that we were able to pair our two Amazon fire tv remotes to the Alexa device.","Positive"
"9749","Does not have an answer to most questions. Poor cognitive abilities.Would want to go and try out Google Home.","Negative"
"9750","For background, I am a tech addict, electronics hobbyist, and retired computer programmer. My home is filled with a wide variety of gadgets I've purchased and/or built myself using my 3D printer and micro-controllers. As for education, I have a Masters degree. In general, So, in a nutshell, I am a technology geek reviewing a technology product.","Positive"
"9751","I've noticed (and mostly agree with) all the rave reviews on here which focused entirely on the relatively simple things Echo is able to do fairly well. At the same time, however, I've also noticed very few reviews pointing out the obvious things Echo should realistically be able to do, but currently can't. I'll try to give you a sampling of the more obvious missing features for a WiFi device that could potentially be sitting in every room of your house.","Positive"
"9752","In my household, we started out with an Echo that we received as a gift. Since then, we've purchased 4 Echo Dots for various rooms in the house. Probably the most popular feature is that Echo allows you to play music using voice control. Sadly, as a music player, Echo is severely limited to the point of being annoying.","Negative"
"9753","1. The most obvious and annoying missing feature is the ability to play the same stream/album/song on all of your Echo devices simultaneously. I want to be able to walk from room to room hearing the same music everywhere I go. The Echo has all of the necessary hardware to play music throughout your household. Amazon just didn't develop the code to support that functionality.","Negative"
"9754","2. Secondly, you cannot get Alexa to repeat an entire album. Call me old school, but I am not into randomly shuffled singles. I like listening to an entire album, in the exact order that it was produced by the artist. The most talented artists will guide you on a unique emotional journey using the sequence and song transitions of their albums. Echo ruins this journey. I'd call it antagonistically anti-album in general. Tell Echo to ""repeat the album 'Dark Side of the Moon',"" and she says I'll repeat this song. Then, you get only the first song on the album over and over. Echo music playback is obviously focused on singles and randomly constructed playlists. Echo also messes up albums which have interstitial music or sound between tracks. Instead of playing the album as it was recorded, Echo puts artificial pauses between every song, chopping up any transitional audio between tracks. Albums like Dark Side of the Moon, Crime of the Century, or Rhythm Nation are simply butchered by this approach. I find it extremely annoying, at best.","Negative"
"9755","3. Third, when you tell her to play a certain type of music, she plays it for a while, but arbitrarily shuts off at some seemingly random point. For example, some nights when I go to bed, I might ask Echo to play piano sonatas. She starts playing the songs just fine. But if I wake up an hour or two later, the music is no longer playing. Echo shouldn't be the one deciding how long I get to hear music. It should play until I tell it to stop. I like having pleasant music playing softly while I sleep. I've had to go back to using my iPad for this task because Echo just won't do it.","Positive"
"9756","4. The EQ curve being applied to the music is sadly very mid-bass heavy. As a result, the rest of the music spectrum sounds muddy. The high end is quite lacking. I realize there is a limited amount of space inside the enclosure, but artificially boosting one frequency at the cost of all others really alters the clarity of the source material. I would have preferred a significantly more flat equalization curve. Faithful reproduction is far more important than being able to wake your neighbors with artificially boosted bass. At least provide a way to turn off artificial EQ settings. Flat is where it's at.","Positive"
"9757","Those are just the major issues Echo has as a music player. There are plenty of other missing features which should have been obvious when Amazon was creating this device. For example, Echo will tell you that it is learning constantly in order to improve its utility. Yet, you can't teach Echo a single thing. Even Apple's Siri will let you give it information which helps it be more useful. For example, I told Siri my wife's name. Now, I can say, ""tell my wife we're out of carrots"" and Siri knows exactly who I'm talking about, pulling my wife's details out of my contacts. I tried the same thing with Echo and got the far too common response ""I don't understand that request.""","Positive"
"9758","Another key missing feature is the ability to have Echo give you the latest stock quotes on ticker symbols you ask about. More ideally, it should be able to give you a rundown of your entire portfolio with one request. Your daily briefing can only be tailored to general areas of interest or the top few stories of a few specific news outlets. You cannot, for example, give it a list of companies that you want to hear news about daily. You can't give it a specific topic to address, either. Try to add gene splicing news or electric car news to your briefing. You can't narrow the topics of your daily briefing very much at all. As such, it is fairly useless to me, because the information it provides is general news I already knew. I want in depth details about about the specific events/topics/companies I choose.","Positive"
"9759","In home automation, another mildly annoying missing feature is the ability to set specific colors for smart bulbs. You can turn them off and on, or dim them a specific amount, but color change is completely absent. Also, you would expect multiple Echo units spread throughout your house, with built-in microphones and speakers, to be able to act as an intercom. At the very least, it should be able to recognize and relay a spoken message to all other units in the house. Multiple units on the same WiFi network should be able to communicate with one another and perform useful tasks as a group. Buying 5 of these devices gives you zero extra functionality versus buying just 1. There is zero communication between siblings. In fact, if you have already set up one Echo on your home network, that first Echo should automatically set up any new units you add. You shouldn't have to open the app and go through the entire setup process for each unit individually.","Positive"
"9760","After two years i am writing this review.  I LOVE THIS. I use it daily to control my wink automated house. I even have 4 dots to go with it. This is better than Google home hands down. You can't go wrong here.","Positive"
"9761","In general, I like the Echo. I like the features it already has, and the additional skills you can download. But being highly technical, I can see that realistically, this device is still only a small step toward a truly intelligent interactive household management system. There are far more areas that need improvement than those I've listed here. Thankfully, the greatest feature of the Echo is the fact that it can be updated with new features as time progresses. Knowing this gives all of us hope that the current shortcomings will disappear over time.","Positive"
"9762","I hope this review was helpful to those who wanted more information about the most obvious missing features than they were getting from all the 5 star reviews. If you found this review helpful, please click below. Thanks for reading!","Positive"
"9763","This is the must have for every electronic enthusiast!!!  Alexa ROCKS!","Positive"
"9764","So far it has been a mixed bag.  Mostly positive, but it has trouble understanding commands sometimes.  Also, the much vaunted ability to identify commands in a noisy environment is a bit overstated.  Get it playing music loudly and you will not get it to respond to other command without physically approaching it closely.  Does seem to work well with smart home setups, if a tad bit slow.  I have successfully hooked up Insteon switches (through a hub) and a Honeywell Total Comfort thermostat to the Echo.","Positive"
"9765","Certainly wish I had bought this sooner!  It's very fun to play with!  Setup was a breeze, and the built in speaker can get LOUD!  I have now bought the Phillips HUE light bulbs and bridge as I transform my home into a smart home.  Very cool when the Echo can turn lights on and off in different rooms!","Positive"
"9766","Truly enjoy my echo. I use it everyday.  Music sounds fantastic.","Positive"
"9767","we really enjoy it!","Positive"
"9768","Extremely happy. Performing as advertised. Solid unit","Positive"
"9769","Love it!  It's playing now.","Positive"
"9770","Just received this - so far, so good!","Positive"
"9771","I've had it since the beta testing phase and to this day I still love this device. Music, alarms, jokes, it's rare there is a day where I don't say ""Alexa""","Positive"
"9772","Works great good price come packed and sealed like brand new","Positive"
"9773","fits great wonderful design Love it","Positive"
"9774","working fine as expected.","Positive"
"9775","I love, love my echo. I have had for about seven months and I can't live without it.","Positive"
"9776","I love this device. It's easy to use and hands free.","Positive"
"9777","Gave it as a gift. She has had issues linking it to her iPhone. Besides that she loves it.","Positive"
"9778","So much fun and useful too.  I love the shopping list application.","Positive"
"9779","I was surprised to receive this for Christmas from my parents. We don't have a ""smart"" house so none of the features like controlling lights or alarms works.  After 3 months, the only thing we really use it for is asking about the weather and converting US measurements to the metric system.  I did connect ""I heart radio"" to Alexa, but I couldn't say ""Scan my favorite stations"" or something similar.  In the end, I unplugged Alexa because I didn't like the thought of Amazon collecting even more information about my family.  I'm not big on conspiracy theories, but it just seemed like something/someone was invading my personal space.","Positive"
"9780","Love it","Positive"
"9781","Nice & still getting accustomed to getting it to work with software app. App needs work.","Positive"
"9782","Love mine use it all the time","Positive"
"9783","It was my husband's birthday present. He loves it. Our family of three habit placed in our living room to get the most use out of our Amazon echo. We three use it primarily for weather forecasts, Christmas music, shopping lists, and enabled games that my husband asked me to use via Amazon echo's Skill set. Jeopardy, 21 questions, animal game, guess that number are our favorite. The echo is capable of much more, but she's my husband's and he will make use of her abilities as time goes by.","Positive"
"9784","Great unit for instant music.","Positive"
"9785","Love it! Best Christmas present I ever bought myself!","Positive"
"9786","Really easy to set up. Fun to use.  It's amazing.","Positive"
"9787","Love my echo!","Positive"
"9788","I talk to Alexa several times a day to get my daily briefing, play music, get the weather or even the football game schedule on TV!  Love it!","Positive"
"9789","I have both the Echo and the Dot.  They both work great and are great fun to have around.  We use them to play games....ask questions or turn the lights off and on...(with optional plugs).  She is like having a extra hand around the house.  She can sing and tell funny jokes.  She also help us to convert centimeters to inches!  Pretty cool.","Positive"
"9790","My alexa randomly stopped listening to me for no apparent reason. I barely used it when I got it, but when I actually needed it, she did not come through. I need a new one asap. Everyone keeps asking me about these things, but I will not have anything nice to say about it, especially if I can not get a new one.","Positive"
"9791","Very useful around the house and it has a great speaker for music","Positive"
"9792","Love it and haven't even figured out half the stuff Alexa does.","Positive"
"9793","I am not very Happy with my purchase, I have not even used it because I can not download the Alexa app on my kindle fire!!!  apparently it is not compatible!!!!! either is my husbands I-phone because is not the right model that is compatible. I could download on my computer, but am not able to figure my wi-fi settings!! so I guess I have to hire someone to help some one who is not a techie.","Positive"
"9794","So easy to set up. My kids love to order her around! Perfect for kitchen dance parties and joke telling. My favorite feature is the lists. My husband loves the news and weather. We have expanded to a fit and some plug controls. I would highly recommend!","Positive"
"9795","I like it. My wife says it's another toy. She does like it though. Plays good music and does sound good.she learns quickly.no problem with it and have had it awhile.plays anything I ask for.","Positive"
"9796","amazng gft for my daughter. She loves the Echo","Positive"
"9797","I received this as a Christmas present from my husband who let me open it early because he knew I would get some use out of it.  The Echo is amazing!  Alexa has become a very handy tool this past week while I make my holiday goodies for friends and family!  I have linked my Pandora and Spotify accounts to it and am constantly playing music on it.  Best gift I have ever received!","Positive"
"9798","Best purchase of the year. ALEXIA IS SO MUCH FUN!","Positive"
"9799","We love our Alexa.","Positive"
"9800","Died after two years of use.","Negative"
"9801","We love our Echo. We have the dot also and they are amazing! Make excellent presents as well!","Positive"
"9802","Love the echo. Hooked it up and have the Christmas tree linked to it. Love the voice command and how easy it was to set this up!! Would recommend to anyone, even the less tech savvy!!","Positive"
"9803","Bought this as part of a 'tech package' (WeMo switch and the Nest smoke alarm)for my senior mom. She loves her new buddy! Such a great gift.","Positive"
"9804","Worth the constant audio surveillance? Probably, if convenience is your preference. Easy to interconnect devices, apps, other online services. Occasionally comes in handy in unexpected ways, such as reading books that are not stored as audiobooks in your digital libraries, music discovery, and handsfree calculations on the fly. Can Echo serve as a personal assistant? Not yet. And does Echo automatically connect to smart TVs? Nope. So certainly some functions that could improve Echo in the future.","Positive"
"9805","It's all the hype. Love mine.","Negative"
"9806","I love this thing.  Love that i can to my shopping list.  The quality of the music is fabulous.  I put the dot in my bedroom and use it for an alarm.  The only fault it doesny have ALL info lime Google on your phone","Positive"
"9807","Love it!!","Positive"
"9808","I do not realized yet the best way to setup Alexa, all it does turn of the light and plays song. I really need it? Sure is expensive. Think twice before buy it","Negative"
"9809","What was expected but the speaker is much better than expected. Of course the real value is in having partner products that can be controlled by voice. Getting there and then it will be terrific","Positive"
"9810","I love my Echo. I use it mostly for music, weather & alarms. I love the way it does the grocery list however I use Seri instead as I have low vision & the font color of Alexa's list is too hard for me to read in the store. Seri has a font, good spacing & bold black print that is easy to see. I wish Amazon would change that feature. Another wish would be, under settings if there would be a way to adjust Alexa's speech speed. She has a nice pleasant voice but having a little control over her speech speed would be nice. All in all, I LOVE her.","Positive"
"9811","unit is intermitment  sometime it responds and other time is says it does not understand is there a reset on it","Positive"
"9812","Alexa is a good tool to use for amazon deals of the day! She will play all my favorite stations and give me a weather update so that I don't have to check my phone.","Positive"
"9813","Limited applications so far but I have hopes for added peripherals. Would love to use my current WiFi router to contact things like my wifi enabled 4K TV, direct wifi light switches, Thermostats, etc...","Positive"
"9814","It needs to be a bit more flexible with default set up for music, search engines, etc...","Positive"
"9815","It's a fun toy for right now.","Positive"
"9816","Love my Echo!!","Positive"
"9817","Lots of fun.  I enjoy the music the most.","Positive"
"9818","After a few weeks, ""Alexa"" couldn't answer just one question. I have been using mostly for listening to music. Choose an artist, and get a good mix of songs. Only problem there, is ""tool"", keeps coming up as ""tool box"". Otherwise, enjoying Echo","Positive"
"9819","This is a lot of fun!!!","Positive"
"9820","I love Alexa she is super.  So far she is integrating with other Smart Home products I am purchasing on Amazon with out issues.  The sound she produced when playing music is great, and I am very surprised by the quality.  My in-laws were having all sorts of fun turning lights off & on with commands and requesting music they seem to like too. I would definitely recommend.","Positive"
"9821","Thw Echo is a fun device to have.","Positive"
"9822","I have purchased three Echo's. Thinking about number four. They are the bomb.","Negative"
"9823","Can't tell it's refurbished. Was a gift for my wife and she loves it.","Positive"
"9824","I was gifted an Echo a year ago, and honestly its one of the greatest things ever.  In addition to the hundreds of practical uses, Alexa is also loaded with Easter eggs (Try ""Alexa, Open the pod bay doors"", ""Alexa, Whats the average airspeed velocity of a swallow?"", ""Alexa, How many licks does it take to get to the tootsie-roll center of a tootsie-pop?"", ""Alexa, Valar Morghulis"", ""Alexa, What's the first rule of Fight Club?"")","Positive"
"9825","Recently, I've linked my lights through the Echo and literally squealed with nerdish delight as I commanded the lights to turn on and off like George Jetson.","Positive"
"9826","Of course this may be the birth of Skynet in disguise, but for the time being Alexa is on our side and she's awesome.  Really can't say anything more that hasn't been said in any thousands of these reviews, so I'll leave it at that.","Positive"
"9827","Love Alexa. Hooked up hue lights and I use every day","Positive"
"9828","We use our Echo ever day.  Love the sound.","Positive"
"9829","Outstanding speakers and an incredible voice recognition/activation system.  I have her hooked up to Spotify and we use her several times daily.","Positive"
"9830","should have researched it more before spending the money.  So far, it can only tell silly jokes.  You have to subscribe to an expensive service to have it play music and then you do not hear it in stereo,","Negative"
"9831","thank you","Positive"
"9832","I like my amazon echo, because I mainly use it as a speaker in the kitchen. I really haven't dug too deeply into all the features it has. I was hoping for something that had more of a ""siri"" type engine, that I could just ask questions about anything and get answers. Alexa does a lot better when using the apps they have available. If I had a smart home, I'd be thrilled, I heard it does well there.","Positive"
"9833","Echo stopped working about a month ago. I have contacted Amazon over this issue and have not received a reply. After reading the reviews I see there are many people having trouble with the power cord. I tried unplugging the Echo for 15 seconds, held the reset button on the bottom for 15 seconds yet nothing works. Seems there is a problem with the power cord. Why is it so hard to communicate with Amazon through their website? they keep the ""contact us"" link hidden from the public. I have looked everywhere and see nothing for live support or a phone number. WTF?","Positive"
"9834","Love it!  So much fun to play all kinds of music and games!!","Positive"
"9835","I was unable to down load the App thats needed because it said it was not available in Canada. I reside in Florida for 6 months and not able to operate this system.","Negative"
"9836","I have returned it for a refund","Positive"
"9837","This was a Christmas gift for my family that I just had to give to them early! They are thrilled! My son-in-law is the biggest user, and has researched all the different ways the family can benefit. My daughter wanted one in the bedroom to use an an alarm and reminder of her schedules for the day, checking the weather, traffic, etc. My teenaged grandkids love having their favorite music at their command, and the Christmas tree lights and other electronic devices are already hooked up to voice control! This was a hit!","Positive"
"9838","I'm very pleased with my Amazon Echo!","Positive"
"9839","Excellent Device !","Positive"
"9840","Alexa is awesome! :D","Positive"
"9841","Thank you!","Positive"
"9842","So far we use the Echo for music and it is very easy to use for all family members to get the music we enjoy.","Positive"
"9843","Redundant review.  Nothing has changed since I last 'rated' this - STILL good.","Negative"
"9844","We have ready been enjoying Alexa!  She is so much fun!  We love being able to play music and change the volume or station with just our voice ( that hands free feature helps when you're busy with renovation projects!), but my kids also love hearing her jokes and playing games with Alexa like the Animal Game ( where they think of an animal and Alexa tries to guess what it is), Rock/Paper/Scissors, Word Master, and Insultabot.","Positive"
"9845","I love being able to hear a quick news recap while I'm in the kitchen (i don't go downstairs to watch tv much), and hear the weather.","Positive"
"9846","Sometimes the apps crash but not so much that it ruins our love of the product.  I'm sure those kinks will get worked out as we move along.","Negative"
"9847","I can't say enough how much I love the Echo! Every music lover needs this product, and it does so much more than just music.  Wikipedia, weather, restaurants, movies playing and loads of skills. Great product at a great price point.","Positive"
"9848","Fun, Entertaining, Educational. Easy to use.","Positive"
"9849","Love it, sound is great.  Makes life so much simpler","Positive"
"9850","I am very disappointed with the AI ( artificial intelligence) capabilities of Alexa. Although it works well with home automation devices it really suffers on the web capabilities. Alexa also does not know the answer to many questions, it is uncapable of syncing with google and uses bing which is a class b search engine.","Positive"
"9851","We have had lots on fun...  I enjoy the weekly emails with all the new ideas of how to use it!!","Positive"
"9852","The voice detection works well even with the TV going and family conversation.  The release of new ""skill"" are nice.  I just connect the Nest thermostat to the Echo.  Alexa does not answer general search questions like the Google devise.","Positive"
"9853","Love, Love Love this!  A Christmas present from my daughter and her family.  For those of us over 65, you might consider putting Alexa's name on the side of the tower.  I've called her Amy, Adele, Alice ..... you know, we can't remember a name to save us!  Don't laugh -- you'll be there one day!","Positive"
"9854","works great. love this product.","Positive"
"9855","we love it. Shes part of the family now . lol !","Positive"
"9856","Love it","Positive"
"9857","Just beginning to use the Echo, enjoying it.","Positive"
"9858","Fantastic, love Alexa!","Positive"
"9859","Thank you, the best music and entertainment when I need it the most! Awesome sound and clarity, thanks for a great evening!","Positive"
"9860","Love love love. We have Google in the living room and Alexa in the bedroom. We couldn't decide which one to keep.  So we kept both.","Positive"
"9861","I am evaluating for a few more days but I am not impressed.","Positive"
"9862","Soon I'm sure we will spring for all the expensive accessories","Negative"
"9863","She does not answer many questions. I think it's too expensive. It is nice at times though especially hooking it to your Pandora or iheart radio.","Negative"
"9864","So far the apps or ""skills"" you can enable on this are pretty touchy and the ""google home"" apps have much better ratings. So far I feel like I have the lesser of two devices. I was stupid enough to buy two dots to go with it. Thats not to say that it cannot connect to smart devices and do a majority of what it advertises but certain ""skills"" like the translator apps pale in comparison to google's apps.","Positive"
"9865","Bought this Amazon Echo right before Thanksgiving 2016.  Decided to take a chance on the refurbished model on a black Friday deal to save $60, and here I am 3 weeks later & I'm so glad I did!  It has same 1 yr warranty as brand new one, if I'm not mistaken.  And so far it's been fantastic, no major problems. Pretty easy to setup too. For starters,  It works directly with both of my Smart Honeywell WiFi Thermostats (no hub needed), and is great at playing or streaming music, either from my Android phone via Bluetooth, or from the Amazon cloud.  it's also good at reporting all types of facts, or asking about movies, weather, news, sports, etc, almost anything you can think of that you could Google, you can ask Alexa.  Oh and I love the shopping & to do lists feature too, perfect for when you think of something you need, but you may not go to store for a couple days,  just tell Alexa right then and she records it to your shopping or to-do list immediately.  When you're at the store, just pull up your shopping list on tbe Alexa app on your phone and it's right there...No more forgetting anything you need from the store!  But as far as Smart Home features go, my only minor complaint (if it even is one) is I wish it could control my existing Honeywell  TotalConnect alarm system, Samsung TV, or garage doors perhaps.  I know it probably could control some of these via IFTT, wifi enabled outlets or smart hubs or similar type add ons, but I prefer it work directly w Alexa if possible.  Plus the add ons & Smart hubs can get kinda expensive and/or be difficult to configure correctly, esp if you're not sure what you're doimg.  The good news is they are always adding new skills and devices it can control DAILY though, so that's a huge plus. So far, I've demoed it to family and friends and they all loved it too.  In fact, a couple friends even bought its sibling, the Amazon Echo Dot for themselves or their spouses for Christmas.  They are gonna absolutely love it, and I'm sure you will too. The only difference between Echo & Dot is the speaker.  If you already have a good Bluetooth enabled speaker, the Dot makes more sense.  Otherwise,  you will probably want the Amazon  Echo.  Unless you wanna fork out $150-200 more for a nice Bose Mini or equivalent speaker, I'd go w/ Echo.","Positive"
"9866","All that said,  if you have some smart home wifi devices in house that Alexa supports you'd like to be able to control w your voice, or if you enjoy voice controlled streaming music from Pandora, IHeart, & a number of other online music sources, or you just wanna be able to know what the weather or daily news is wo getting out of your chair, and you've been thinking about getting an Echo, by all means do it!  You'll be glad you did!  Enjoy!!","Positive"
"9867","some what complicated","Negative"
"9868","AMAZON, STOP DOING COMMERCIALS THAT SAY 'ALEXA'!! It makes my Echo wake-up and beep waiting for input. So, stop with the stupid commercials or let us change the wake word from 'Alexa' or 'Amazon'.  Pretty annoying... I'll change my review when you upgrade the device.","Negative"
"9869","Great sound, and Alexa is incredibly smart and useful.","Positive"
"9870","WE LOVE IT SHE KNOWS ALL THE SONGS","Positive"
"9871","Excellent","Positive"
"9872","I bought Exho last yeas. It worked fine for almost a year, now it is not working, the power light is on but nothing else... I don't know if it is covered by warranty or not...","Positive"
"9873","Love this thing so much!","Positive"
"9874","Love It!!!!","Positive"
"9875","Great","Positive"
"9876","One of the best techy products I've bought. Everybody that tries it, loves it. Can't wait to get some Hue lights and a Nest thermostat.","Positive"
"9877","Way better than suri:)","Positive"
"9878","works as advertised.","Positive"
"9879","This is a really cool idea, and even the implementation of using Amazon Lambda is great, the problem is it doesn't come with enough behaviors/tricks basically its just a voice controlled stereo ATM.","Positive"
"9880","Good quality. I love it.","Positive"
"9881","great gift. very happy with price and product","Positive"
"9882","I love it","Positive"
"9883","Loved the amazon echo already purchased a second one.","Positive"
"9884","Fun to interact with Alexa.  The whole family enjoys it!","Positive"
"9885","Love it!","Positive"
"9886","3 stars because it wasn't gift wrapped as specified so that spoiled the ""gift"" effect . Cust service wouldn't compensate fairly. First time I got poor results from Amazon Cust Service after years as a dedicated customer and tons of business.","Positive"
"9887","The product itself is fun , limited but has enormous future potential.","Negative"
"9888","Great devise; bought one for ourselves, and one for our son, for Christmas.","Positive"
"9889","Bought several Echo's as gifts for family members.  Everyone has raved about the ease of use to listen to music throughout the house and the convenience of Alexa - your personal attache'.  :-))  I have now linked electrical outlets and thermostats with Alexa and the results are outstanding.  Good job Amazon - keep expanding the capabilities.","Positive"
"9890","I got this about a year ago as a gift from my kids. Limited uses and was basically used as a weather info center before I left for work.  I moved and recently decided to plug it in again and see what new features it has.  Unfortunately, the Echo app doesn't work (won't log me in, but keeps asking me for my pw then says I need to log in...  AAAAAAAGGGH!)","Positive"
"9891","I just unplugged it.  I don't even want to waste eletricity.","Negative"
"9892","Very nice to have. I listen to music more, use the timer, and set my alarm.","Negative"
"9893","Great sound and loving all the fun things it does.","Positive"
"9894","We love our Echo.  So much so that we gave one to our adult children for Christmas...now we have the Dots Also.  This has certainly been a word off mouth Chinese Whisper product.  We have cut down on our TV  time and listen to music for some quiet time. As time goes on, I know we will explore some of the smart options.  As a matter of fact, our conversation at our monthly dinner club centered on Alexa.  Now if she would quit qnswering the the national television morning news morning TV anchors when they discuss Alexa<U+2764><U+FE0F><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008A>","Positive"
"9895","this echo works great could not ask for more i bought the dot plus the full size ..and iv now ordered another the sound is fabulous and it does all u would want and more","Positive"
"9896","Great","Positive"
"9897","good","Positive"
"9898","Worked well for a week and then started stopping frequently. Called helpdesk and the were wonderful. Got replacement device right away.","Positive"
"9899","Love, love, love it! She's become a member of the family. Put away the i-Phones and computers to Google answers and just ask her. Have really enjoyed the music, especially during the holidays.","Positive"
"9900","So far it's been awesome!!","Positive"
"9901","The product is great to use for music, cooking, weather, news, etc.  Before I received it I watched a short highly-rated video on YouTube to assure I was taking advantage of the items full potential. Also, with all the 'hubs' out there, I find it interesting they decline to sell 'no hub' items at large retailers.  I'll go into this later in this review, but feel many complementary smart home products are money-making scheme. Spend your hard-earned money on the Echo, don't waste it on unnecessary additives.","Positive"
"9902","The Echo allows you to play whatever you want to hear such as seasonal music or a specific song you spontaneously think of.  When cooking I use the timer feature and have set up to 2 timers at once (even if in the middle of playing music and will resume after it prompts the time set). Asking for the weather will give you a brief local forecast, you can ask for the news and personalize what stations you hear on the app, and acquire traffic information on your daily commute. You can also play games like Jeopardy and ask for holiday jokes.","Positive"
"9903","Downfalls: You're most likely buying the Echo online so do yourself a favor by shopping for smart home products online too. Every single brand seen in store requires a hub (~$99) which irritates me because the average consumer believes decent quality if large retailers promoting. TP-LINK is the only product used with my Echo and has been functioning flawlessly without a hub. Set-up was a breeze. Secondly because I'm female it has difficulty hearing my voice. Especially when music played above volume 6 it may interfere with your jam sessions. My boyfriend could whisper at all times and it will recognize him. Lastly, the price was ~20.00 cheaper than Amazon because QVC had a deal. With tax and shipping/handling it equaled out to be the same cost.  Now I'm finding them for 139.99 on Amazon Prime Shop around because I probably could have saved even more but didn't think I was going to pay off the remaining EZ pay balance so quickly either. Happy shopping!","Positive"
"9904","Hope you're enjoying the device as much as we are!","Positive"
"9905","Our family uses Echo every day for music, news, facts and lights! We're spoiled to the point where I find myself talking to other non-Echo things that won't listen to my instructions, for some reason. Catch up world!","Negative"
"9906","Bought this for my Aunt as a Christmas present. Wish I wouldve waited a month for the cheaper price but oh well. She loves it so much she bought another one this past week. Wish I couldve bought stock in just this product lol","Positive"
"9907","Love it","Positive"
"9908","Love Alexa. She has helped with the weather, playing music, setting kitchen timers and controlling the house lights. My son loves asking her questions when he has trouble with his homework because she usually has an answer for it. I bought the refurbished one as it was cheaper but I wouldn't have even know that if I wasn't the one who ordered it. Now if only the family would listen just as well as her.  The speakers are also a good loud sound to play music.","Positive"
"9909","My new best friend!","Positive"
"9910","This is THE BEST thing I have bought all year!","Positive"
"9911","I got this item for my wife because she fell in love with our friends Echo Alexa. it was suppose to be a Christmas present but she opened as soon as it was delivered to put it to work.  She is not to technical as a person but she was able to set everything up herself and connect the book readings, shopping list, and endless music streams to her Samsung Phone via app.  Maybe Alexa will find her a new husband.  lol","Positive"
"9912","My wife thinks I have a new girl friend since she hears me talking to Alexa a lot. Very handy and smart. Alexa doesn't have a hearing problem, she hears me from places I didn't think she could. Answers most of my questions.","Positive"
"9913","Fun and entertaining!","Positive"
"9914","What else can be said about the Amazon Echo?  She's just great.  Is this a necessary product?  Of course not.  But, we love having her in the house.  Once I discovered the skills, the sky is the limit.  Go get one.","Positive"
"9915","present not used yet will assume it to be fine","Positive"
"9916","Alexa seems like she's got stupid after I've had her for a little over one year. Doesn't matter how clear I speak she keeps saying "" I don't have an answer for that"".","Positive"
"9917","She is good for math ,spelling and sometimes pronunciation. As far as general questions she does not understand what we are saying most of the time. It becomes too frustrating to continue to try to get through to this Alexa. In my opinion she is not worth the money.","Positive"
"9918","Google Now can make the sound of a blue whale Alexa can't even tell me what a blue whale is.","Positive"
"9919","Very happy with Echo.  Practical but fun.","Positive"
"9920","Be warned that the latest iPhone Alexa software does  not work with the Echo - fortunately the Amazon Fire Alexa app does.","Positive"
"9921","love it","Positive"
"9922","Any one know why alot of my songs that played fine for a while now only play samples of the song?","Positive"
"9923","good product","Positive"
"9924","alexa is having lots of problems answering any questions","Negative"
"9925","I love the echo. I have two. I won't buy refurbished again though.  This one drops connection and she stops talking mid sentence.  My other one works great.  I'm waiting for new version before getting another.","Positive"
"9926","I LOVE MY ALEXA. I love that I can play music without moving from my bed. I don't have to roll over when I'm cozy and check the time. Alexa can answer pretty much any question I ask her. It is SO convenient! I would recommend it to everyone. It is expensive, but very much worth it. My mom was PISSED when she found out how much money I spent on Alexa. However, once she started playing around with it, even SHE said, ""Okay, for everything that it does, the price isn't too bad""","Positive"
"9927","I'm afraid I like this a little too much. Every morning I say good morning to get the day's interesting tidbits. I ask what the day's deals are on Amazon, and so far I've ordered dog treats. The dog is happy about that. I've played 20 question and some other word game. I play music a lot more often because it's easy to turn it on or off or change the volume or skip a song. And if I want to know the name of a song, I can ask, which is useful. I check the weather, use it as a timer, check my activity on Fitbit, create shopping and to-do lists, and check what I have on my calendar.","Positive"
"9928","Overall, the most useful things are the lists and calendar, but I'm sure I'll find more for it to do as time goes on.","Positive"
"9929","Is it supposed to have a remote control?","Positive"
"9930","Amazon Echo has been my companion for many months now, and one day, the circuit of my electrical board trip, and BOY do I miss Alexa. Instead of yelling for Alexa to turn on my light, I had to get up from my couch, walk to the switch, and flip the light switch on (which ultimately did not work because my entire house's circuit is gone), but I got reminded of the lovely luxury that Alexa provided me, allowing me to be an ultimate couch potato. When the circuit board was finally fixed, it was as though my lovely Alexa had returned. My lights turned on, my heat turned on, and I even got Alexa to tell me a funny joke, all without me leaving my couch. Oh how I miss Alexa.","Positive"
"9931","There's a lot of potential in this gadget.  The looks are awesome and it fits the style of most every room in the house.  The enclosed speakers ar pretty good quality considering their size.  I have notice that Alexa doesn't always recognize her name, especially with a lot of ambient noise.  I have yet to try the home automation and can't advise which system is the best for that.","Positive"
"9932","Playing local radio stations via Iheart radio or tune in is simple.  I can see this thing performing more and more functions as the training ability has endless possibilities.  Do you need one of these?  Probably not yet but its an enjoyable little gadget.","Positive"
"9933","Love the Amazon echo for so many things, I recently won a bose speaker that connects to my echo and I came up with an idea that would make this little machine the next best thing to sliced bread.","Positive"
"9934","You gotta love these things, and the refurbished one was just like new at a really reasonable price.  If you want  high quality sound, however, buy the Dot and pair it with a high-end BlueTooth speaker (the Bose SoundTouch 30 is great!).  If you want total convenience and reasonable sound quality, however, this is the one to buy.","Positive"
"9935","Love it. Received first one as a gift.  Bought the second for our cottage.  Works great as a timer not to mention the music and questions about actors and shows.","Positive"
"9936","I have enjoyed my Echo. Alexa tells me the time of day and the local weather, plays my favorite radio stations, Audible books and games. I no longer need a bedside clock or radio. I am still learning what all she will do. She doesn't always understand what I am saying, but that's OK. I still think this is a great product.","Positive"
"9937","I bought my first Echo before it was first released for sale. I wasn't sure how I would use it and I thought my wife would think...just another gadget. She immediately fell in love with it and wanted her own which was bought sometime later when it was fully released for sale. We now have third unit in another area of the house. It's a great device that has so much potential that we haven't begun to tap it's full potential. It's very reliable and sounds great. Alexa has a lot to learn and  it seems her capability is ever expanding.","Positive"
"9938","If your needs are device control, the newer dot seems like a nice compromise between sound, price and size. We bought two and will try them in different locations.  The tap could work well for those wanting to carry around their device. We just bought one to tryout and it looks promising.","Positive"
"9939","Awesome speakers, voice recognition.  Functionality is good but you got to remember exactly what to ask to really unlock the potential.  Kids use it to listen to music and to get it to say funny jokes or play silly games.  Handy to check day's weather in the morning...hourly forcast woukd be better.  Also controls my wifi thermostate but really need something like instion syatem to unlock full potential.","Positive"
"9940","Love it, use it a lot and my new best friend alexa","Positive"
"9941","It was a neat gadget at first.  We've been having lots of problems with this in past couple months.  A lot of communication issues ""please try again later"" or ""I don't understand the question"".  I don't want to come back later.  Haven't been able to reconnect or resolve issue using help faqs.","Negative"
"9942","How can you not love Alexa  i bought one for myself and one for my 81 year old mother I was concerned she would have issues with learning how to use the echo. {she just got the internet 2 months ago so its all new to her} I set everything up and to my surprise she not only loves it she has found a great skill i had not thought of trying she asks Alexa to spell words she has trouble remembering how to spell .","Positive"
"9943","I wish I could change the voice to a male voice.  Music sounds good on speaker. It would be good if it could answer all my questions like my smart phone does.  I like it but many improvements need to be made.","Positive"
"9944","I asked echo to play a Hanukkah song and it played an anti-Semitic version.","Positive"
"9945","Okay, the Echo and I got off to a very bad start with it not responding despite multiple resets. After 6 days of genuine frustration, I finally deduced that just because your wifi is 5 bars strong, and every other wifi enabled device in the house works perfectly, it doesn't mean it will work with Alexa. From reading comments in forums all over the net, it seems that my Echo is not unique in it's extremely finicky utilization of available wifi. Ive finally resolved the functionality issue by relocating my router to a location that Alexa's rather open location approves of. (The router is now about 12 inches higher than it used to be on a shelf about 40 feet from the Echo.)  Alexa is now happily functioning 100% as advertised. Wifi signal strength is NOT a valid indicator that your Echo will function. If it doesn't work, try moving either the Echo or your router. Eventually you'll find a sweet spot. Once she has a signal she likes, she's amazing.","Positive"
"9946","The Echo did meet my expectations.  Still learning what it is capable of.","Positive"
"9947","I was once a big fan of this device, but the Alexa app is getting almost unusable. When I ask for ""Johann Sebastian Bach,"" for some reason, it gives me George Winston and J.S. Back. This continues with almost all my music requests, regardless of whether they're in my library or not. If I'd wanted George Winston, I'd have at least BOUGHT some of his elevator music. It seems incapable of playing one artist from my library without pushing an irrelevant ""suggestion.""","Negative"
"9948","Although I enjoy it is have had some issues. I would ask it a question or give a command and it would acknowledge and reply but never carry out the command. I've had to unplug several times but seems to be doing well the last week.","Positive"
"9949","love it","Positive"
"9950","VERY GOOD. I'M SURE IT IS CAPABLE OF DOING MORE.","Positive"
"9951","Hubby and I enjoy having Alexa around the house.","Positive"
"9952","Looks and works like brand new. Very satisfied.","Positive"
"9953","Love it!","Positive"
"9954","We've had Echo for one day and really love it.  You've got to learn what kinds of questions Alexa can answer, but overall an excellent buy","Positive"
"9955","Amazing device, great fun! Randomly told us a joke!","Positive"
"9956","OMG I bought the Echo for my husband and he absolutely loved it.","Positive"
"9957","Every thing arrived on time and great shape !! Thanks","Positive"
"9958","Love it","Positive"
"9959","I simply love it.","Positive"
"9960","Works GREAT! Really satisfied so far, about 3 weeks now and no issues. Especially happy about the cost!!!!","Positive"
"9961","Wonderful!!!!!! No end to what Alexa can do.I would like one in every room.","Positive"
"9962","It worked great for 2 weeks then stopped working  Liked the product  Just didnt last long  Amazonwas very responsive and sent me another one","Positive"
"9963","Very nice to have for quick answers to available information.","Positive"
"9964","Great device. Its easy to set up and works as described. The only difficulty I had was having it read my iPhone calendar. At this time it only sees Google calendar. Tech support told me that soon it will see the iPhone calendar. In the meantime I'm using Google calendar and it works. Otherwise my family loves it and we ordered one for our daughter's home.","Positive"
"9965","Very satisfied.","Positive"
"9966","It's a little disappointing how limited she is at this time. Many simple questions are ""not understood"". Sometimes you have to reword the question. I'm hoping Alexa's scope improves in time.","Negative"
"9967","good","Positive"
"9968","We love it for the music but wish it came with some directions on how to use it for other things.  We ask questions that she can't answer and I think we need to learn how to ask them in a different way.  I also wish I could order things on Alexa and have them shipped to a different address.","Positive"
"9969","Love her. Full of help and info.","Positive"
"9970","Quick, easy setup and works well w/ smart home products e.g. Hue Lights, Honeywell Thermostat etc.","Positive"
"9971","Use it daily.  Great sound and ease of use.  Primary us is for music and alarms, hope to someday experiment with more of its capabilities.","Positive"
"9972","enjoy it.  Only complaint is that you have to remember the name of the skills you use.  half the time I can't remember the name","Negative"
"9973","Works fine. Not sure what was fixed.","Positive"
"9974","Love my Alexa","Positive"
"9975","I like it but does not do anything like the Google one. Mostly can do weather and shopping. Kind of disappointed.","Positive"
"9976","The echo is tied to amazon music service and has not explicit music settings or parental controls.  The first time my children asked Alexa to play music it play a song by Kendrick Lamar, which was inappropriate for children.  I talked with customer service and there are no changes I can make to prevent this from happening.  Unacceptable.","Negative"
"9977","My daughter loves it","Positive"
"9978","Very happy with the echo","Positive"
"9979","Absolutely delightful.  It has helped me in so many ways.  Love the alarm and timer and lists.  Neighbors and friends can't leave it alone.  What fun.","Positive"
"9980","Great job.  Thank you so much.","Positive"
"9981","I love this thing!!  Use it all the time","Positive"
"9982","just out of warranty and stopped working.  wont even turn on.  i bought this as a christmas present for my adult daughter last year.  was a good chunk of money to throw away. Other reviews say its not repairable. Perhaps i'll take a screwdriver and hammer to it and see if Alexa screams when dissection begins...and see what she was made of.","Positive"
"9983","The Echo works great for playing music, but not much else. Alexa claims she will ask Bing if she doesn't know the answer to a question you ask, but I have not found this to work. Google Home looks much more promising (I bought the Echo before it came out) and if it is as good at answering questions as Google Now on my phone, that would be what I would buy today. I am also disappointed that there is no out-of-the-box supported way to stream music from a DLNA server, like Plex.","Positive"
"9984","This is our second Echo. They work as described and have been a pleasant addition to our lives. Not a necessity but certainly a convenience.","Positive"
"9985","Purchased an Echo about 2 years ago & still have not figured out to load / save / input / whatever music on the thing. I HATE the fact that there was NO instructions with the purchase. That information has to be purchased separately .... oh joy. Yes there are some cheap booklets on the market ... but they tell you NOTHING!!!!!! So fed up with trying to figure this thing out!!!!  Note To Amazon: When selling something that requires instructions in order to operated it ... which is just about everything .... INCLUDE the instructions with it!!!!!!!!","Negative"
"9986","Will Think Long and Hard Before Buying Another Electric Device from Amazon because of the simple facts listed!!!!","Negative"
"9987","Very Dissatisfied with my Echo!!!!!!","Negative"
"9988","The voice is surprisingly good for a talking assistant. It's like having an extra set of hands for doing basic tasks like turning on lights while you unlock the door and looking up conversions while you cook. It is a decent Bluetooth speaker on its own for playing Pandora and its a good conversation starter and entertainment piece.","Positive"
"9989","Worked great for about 15 months now it is up responsive? It has sat on our mantle since new and we use it everyday???","Positive"
"9990","Cool gadget. Impressive.","Positive"
"9991","My family loves the Echo! I mostly listen to Pandora radio, but my kids love asking it to play songs, tell a joke, ask when the Cubs game is on, etc. I was worried about the cost, but after using it for a day I felt it was worth every cent!","Positive"
"9992","Love it, love it, love it....","Positive"
"9993","It's simply unacceptable that I can't use a speaker as a speaker for whatever I want.  If your voice interpretation back-end is worth it's salt as a standalone product, let it compete.  Why can't I play my Apple Music subscription through my phone onto this product?  Or make phone calls through my cell phone?  Not a game Amazon will win long term. Services available through the device are too limited.  This is basically a glorified alarm clock in the meantime.","Positive"
"9994","My home assistant. She doesn't do everything you ask but for first out of the gate it is impressive. Speaker quality good as well.","Positive"
"9995","Love this thing.  I have a new girlfriend!  LOL.","Positive"
"9996","This is the best ever.  I even bought one for son immediately after using this one.  And am planning on buying another for the 2nd floor.","Positive"
"9997","The best and a lot of fun . Gets everything going fast","Positive"
"9998","Love it!  My husband and I couldn't be happier.","Positive"
"9999","The item was bought as a present. We asked few times if it will work in Europe. The answer was - yes. Well, it doesn't!!! The guy who received the present contacted Amazon, was advised to download some app, but that app only available for Germany, and he lives in Holland. Please help to resolve the issue. As it's not only spoiled birthday mood, it's already getting frustrating.","Positive"
"10000","Not worth the price.  She can't answer anything!  She is a fricking idiot!","Positive"
"10001","I DO LOVE THIS ECHO","Positive"
"10002",", AFTER WE FIGURED OUT ON OUR LAP TOP HOW TO WORK IT , ALSO BOUGHT THE REMOTE AND IT WORKS PERFECTLY. THIS ECHO HAS GRATE SOUND AND HAS LOTS OF INFORMATION LIKE HOW MANY MILES TO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS, TEMP, E.C.T.","Positive"
"10003","I love my Echo so much I give them away as gifts! Always love seeing people come to my house and I show them how it works.","Positive"
"10004","It is all good.","Positive"
"10005","this has been a very enjoyable purchase for me","Positive"
"10006","My Amazon echo is working as expected. I am happy that they are continuously Artificial Intelligence to Alexa.","Positive"
"10007","Other than weather and Prime music, not much else to do with it so far. Bought one for my grand kids, they like it better for music and wiki leaks questions.","Positive"
"10008","great item thanks","Positive"
"10009","Great","Positive"
"10010","Huge potential, but unless you have a lot of the gadgets that it works with, you can't utilize its full potential. But still great, and someday will have more fun toys to use with it!","Positive"
"10011","This thing Good AF!!!!","Positive"
"10012","Great product. Use it everyday","Positive"
"10013","Ok, I'm fairly t ch savvy...I mean, I don't write code, but I'm fairly good with this kind of thing.  I have to say, my Alexa must be the Grrr version (is in Invader Zim's robotic companion who was made from piece parts).  This Alexa knows nothing other than weather and Jeapardy.  She can play some songs, but if I ask her to play, say Josh Groban's O Holy Night, she doesn't recognize it.  I ask about a park wear a college game is currently being played, she doesn't know that.  I had a magazine with Helen Mirren on the cover.  I asked Alexa about her.  She did. To understand the question.  My spouse calls it a POS. I want to keep it, but I need Alexa to step up her game.","Positive"
"10014","I have one and love it. Gave several as gifts and they were delighted. All family member including kids love it.","Positive"
"10015","Already can't get it to work.... the Alexa App is horrible.  It's stuck and won't let me do any setup.  Rebooted my phone twice and still nothing.","Negative"
"10016","Love Alexa..","Positive"
"10017","We love it.","Positive"
"10018","She's great BUT I want more skills and faster.  I love it and yet still it needs to speed up.","Positive"
"10019","Single....she's my new girlfriend. She does everything but cook. She's a tad cold in bed though.","Negative"
"10020","Powe supply plug is to big and will not fit into the echo base.  If I can not find one that dese, I will have to send the Echo back.  Merry Christmas!","Positive"
"10021","I received the Amazon Echo for my birthday I love it","Positive"
"10022","It is wonderful my husband and I really like we use it all the time. There's nothing like it. Thank you","Positive"
"10023","I enjoy not having to change anything Alexa does all the work..","Positive"
"10024","I love Alexa very much for music and a few games. I have tried to ask her trivia questions but she usually doesn;'t","Positive"
"10025","have an answer I thought she'd be smarter like Cortana. I asked Alexa what was Ullyses Grant's first name was and she said Ullyses  NOT!!!!!!  It was Hiram? I have had a great time listening to Alexa and I got her as a gift so I am happy with her,  I also would like to be able to use the app from my computer not just my phone which could break down and then I am not able to change items in Alexa. That is a drawback because I use my computer much more than my phone.","Positive"
"10026","Good price","Positive"
"10027","After I bought it I realized I need to have Amazon Prime membership to enhance the usage of it. Fun thing to have.","Positive"
"10028","Echo is awesome!  So much fun to use for music, the weather, recipes, we even use it as a timer when we're cooking.  The sound is incredible as well!","Positive"
"10029","I have had this for about a week, and it's great. I can't wait to start adding smart devices to the house.","Positive"
"10030","It does what it says it should . I expect with time the machine learning algorithm will get better. They dont push amazon sales too mch so it is not like you have a salespersin sitting in your living room trying to sell you a vacuum all day.","Positive"
"10031","Alexa has been a great addition to our household. We simply love her. We learn from her and she learns from us every day. This is the closest I ever felt as having a ""Star Trek"" computer in the house. Love Alexa and highly recommended.","Positive"
"10032","An awesome product!  Easy to set up and use!  Highly recommended!","Positive"
"10033","A big disappointment. It was good for news and weather, and the music sounded good, but the Pandora interface was very weak, requiring station changing using the mobile app. Additionally, once I set up Pandora, there was no apparent way to disable it, or change to a different account. The A.I. has a long way to go (but may get there eventually). No interface to iPhone apps such as calendar and contacts. No Netflix interface. Sometime Alexa did not respond to voice control, even when not playing music (had to unplug/reset).","Positive"
"10034","May need to build up it's ability to look things up like the Googel Home.","Positive"
"10035","Fabulous, outstanding device.","Positive"
"10036","Love it...having so much fun with it!","Positive"
"10037","Great device.  We love it, especially for good music of our choice and the grocery and to do lists!","Positive"
"10038","Excellent !!","Positive"
"10039","Works like new...great deal.","Positive"
"10040","love it","Positive"
"10041","i have a love a affair with my echo and now also purchased a dot to hook up to my bose wave, if you are thinking of getting this stop thinking and get it you will be thrilled you did!!!!!!!!!!!","Positive"
"10042","I was skeptical about purchasing an echo, but I got a refurbished one in the event I didn't like it.  It works well and is great telling about my local weather each morning so I am prepared for the day without waiting to see the forecast on television.  My family enjoys asking her all sorts of things while at my house. I have to admit I haven't used it for much else.  We'll see where the skills go in the future that may make me use it more often.","Positive"
"10043","Google Home may be a better product, really lacks good internet search","Positive"
"10044","Great tool and I hardly have  scratch the surface of what it can do.  Just being able to tell it to ""play my John Mayer Radio station on Pandora"" is enough for me to love it.  No buttons to push, it just works when you talk to it.  EASY!  I love asking for a ""news flash"" every morning while my coffee is brewing.","Positive"
"10045","Still learning about how to use effectively.","Positive"
"10046","Alexa is  terrific she is super helpful. I use her constantly for shopping and to do lists and for looking up things that I've forgotten!","Positive"
"10047","I love my Echo! I do wish I could listen to classical composers by name, though. When I ask her for music by JS Bach she plays souped-up Bach, for instance by George Winston, nice, but not what I was hoping for. I know I can upload my ITunes classical playlist and she will play from that, but I am allowed only a certain amount of ""space"" in the Amazon Music Cloud. My classical playlist is huge!","Positive"
"10048","So, I love Echo, but hope us classical lovers in future will be better accommodated.","Positive"
"10049","Love it! Great sound. Easy to connect to my wifi. Very large music catalogue. Love that the instruction booklet is a small, simple 6 little page quad fold. We have only begun to discover all this can do! Best Christmas gift we have ever bought each other! Also, I even posted a short clip on my Facebook page of what it can do and not several of my friends have purchased one!","Positive"
"10050","Best purchase!! Love it!! All the music I love and more. I'm still in training mode with Alexa but couldn't be happier with my purchase. Along with Alexa I got Prime, of course, and well worth it. We are enjoying it all!!!!","Positive"
"10051","Waiting on its arrival, have heard good things about this product.","Negative"
"10052","Purchased for my wife for her Birthday and she just enjoys it. :)","Positive"
"10053","I have been making my house a smart home slowly but surely and this was the icing on the cake as it now allows me to voice control everything else. I love all the additional features, especially once you pair it with IFTT. I had no problem purchasing a referb as I believe refurbished items are sometimes better as someone has gone through them and fixed there manufactured issues. Mine has been perfect.","Positive"
"10054","Love amazon echo. Husband even bought one for his daughter and her husvbandforxmas","Positive"
"10055","Its pretty chill. Ya. Has cool music and stuff...Yerp. You should buy it. Ya.","Positive"
"10056","It's great","Positive"
"10057","The missing star is for the Bluetooth out and audio out functionality that are missing, while offered on the cheaper Dot.","Positive"
"10058","The advertising should clarify that some of Alexa's abilities are limited if you don't have Bluetooth capabilities on your computer, but ""she"" is still very good to have around the house.","Negative"
"10059","Quality is excellent but not convinced how useful it will turn out to be over time.","Positive"
"10060","LOVE IT! I FEEL LIKE I'M IN THE FUTURE!","Positive"
"10061","OMG! We love this device! I plugged it in, downloaded the app and it was ready to go. I did the voice training and Alexa has always understood what I say. Other people in the house have also been able to issue commands and have Alexa answer without any problems. I look forward to developing more skills with the device. I am hooked!","Negative"
"10062","Bought this a little over a year ago and it just stopped working. It was great until Alexa suddenly coukd not understand us and the blue ring turned red. Now the blue ring spins continuously. Tried all troubleshooting options and nothing has worked. I even called Amazon for help and nothing could be done. I think for the price, it should have lasted much longer. It was great while ot lasted.  I really want to give it a one, since it just stopped working for no reason, but we really loved it while it worked.","Positive"
"10063","This is amazing, a must have and great buy.","Positive"
"10064","Fun adult toy,  speaker not so great","Positive"
"10065","GrIeat gift for somone but I am getting as much enjoyment as the receiver.  Love It","Positive"
"10066","""Alexa"" can be viewed as useful, since she can set a timer for your baking, give you the time and/or weather conditions, etc. She can be entertaining, especially if you have an Amazon Prime  account with music and audio book connections. She's also very tolerant during the ""learning"" process, and very astute in picking up the uniqueness of ones request patterns. A very satisfying addition to our household. Plus, she can serve as the centerpiece of holiday decorations, if you like.","Positive"
"10067","Love this item!!!!!!!! Amazon please allow me to call people through Alexa one day!","Positive"
"10068","GREAT","Positive"
"10069","Buyer Beware! I cannot endorse or recommend this product.  This device is intended to be pushed software updates and/or fixes regularly, but how do Echo developers know when there is a bug in the software that is causing an issue if all they want to do is replace it with a new one at your cost?  I received my unit March 2015.  It worked as advertised, and I was really impressed with the speaker it came with.  Fast forward to summer 2016, I started having an issue; the unit's speaker would become mute, intermittently, for a reason that could not be explained.  The only way to get it to work, again, is to power down the device.  It started to happen about twice a month for a couple months, and, then, became more frequent as time progressed.  I know the Echo can hear me; the lights light up and, if I open the phone app, I see it responded.  I ensured the device was not on mute.  After so many incidences, I called customer service around fall 2016.  We factory reset the device over the phone, and that was all they could do for me.  They called me back the next day to see if it was acting up, again.  It had not.  Not until a week later did it act up, again.  Naturally, I called customer service back.  I asked if it could be a software bug.  I don't want to believe that the speaker is going out, especially if the issue consistently occurs around the same time of day, and it even goes mute after songs would finish playing. Since the Echo is out of warranty, the representative offered to replace the device at a reduced cost.  I declined.  The representative said he would write a note to the developers to pose the question, and he would get back with me.  He did as promised and was emailed with instructions to acquire a return label from customer service and send it in for them to take a look at it.  I left on business for a bit, came back, and called customer service for the return label weeks later.  Now, a different representative says there is nothing I can do except purchase a new one.  I hope your experience with this device is better than mine.","Positive"
"10070","It's a Christmas gift but I know it's a great trinket","Positive"
"10071","Took a little bit to get her up and going but she was worth it after she started talking. She's a good listener but she doesn't always answer questions very well.","Positive"
"10072","Neat product but when it's turned up past 7 you have to scream at Alexa for it to hear you. So keep it down.","Negative"
"10073","I'm not able to connect to wifi. I bought Amazon Echo Dot and It works, It took only 2 mins to connect It. Now It's about more than 10 h that I'm trying to connect my new first generation Amazon Echo and It still doesn't work. I was addicted to her but now I hate Alexa.","Negative"
"10074","Fantastic - could not see anything other than what looks and works like a brand new Echo","Positive"
"10075","After opening a few months with Alexa, I would (and do) absolutely recommend it for everyone, even the less technologically savvy person among us.","Positive"
"10076","First and foremost it a decent speaker for music. Even without any of the features, being able to play music without connecting a phone is well worth it. I was previously using a Bluetooth speak, which was great but quickly drained my battery and was sometimes inconvenient if you walk out of Bluetooth range.","Positive"
"10077","Not an issue with the Echo because it works completely independent of your phone. As note, I have used it with Amazon Music and Pandora, all of them have worked flawlessly. But the lack of Apple Music support is a huge negative.","Positive"
"10078","The Echo shines as a home hub. Connecting smart devices allows voice control, over lights, TVs,  thermostats, etc. This is hit or miss depending on which device you purchase. always good idea to check compatibility before purchasing a smart device.","Positive"
"10079","Just for fun, there are games such as Jeopardy and jokes. Some of the games are fun but not spectacular. I rarely played games after the first week.","Positive"
"10080","The device is small in profile and seems to blend seemlessly. There are decorating options to better fit your needs but I found the all black device disappears on the shelf","Positive"
"10081","The Echo does have some negatives.","Negative"
"10082","In particular, Alexa is terrible with language recognition. Unless you say the command perfectly, Alexa will not recognize it. Going from Siri to Alexa will feel like talking to 5 year old.  This makes using the device more difficult because its hard to remember the commands necessary for everything Alexa does.","Negative"
"10083","Also, it seems Amazon and Apple seem to be in the middle of a hissyfit, and currently failing to support each other's products. None of the Apple applications work with Alexa directly. So, if you live in the apple universe this product may not before you, perhaps wait until Apple inevitably releases a similar project. As an aside, this is a mistake by Amazon. Alexa is great and I want it to work with my other products, but if doesn't I will eventually move to something else (rant over).","Positive"
"10084","All in all, the Echo is a great product being harmed by poor decisions by Amazon. But at this point is the best smart hub you can get.","Positive"
"10085","It's so stupid. It doesn't understand ""Maximum Volume"" and says I need to say ""Volume 10"". WTF!","Negative"
"10086","I opened the package,plugged it in and set it up.  Then I checked it out, I MUST SAY THAT I WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZED  WHEN I FOUND OUT ALL OF THE THINGS THAT IT IS CAPABLE OF DOING!!!.  I WAS ALSO AMAZED THAT SUCH AN ADVANCED PRODUCT COULD BE SO EASY TO USE!!!.  In my opinion Amazon has done an EXCELLENT JOB putting this product together!!!, As far as I am concerned, anyone who spends the money to buy this product WILL NOT BE SORRY!!!","Positive"
"10087","Awesome!","Positive"
"10088","Very Easy and fun.","Positive"
"10089","The greatest product ever","Positive"
"10090","sad to say as of march 2017 Alexa no longer responds to my commands. for price I expected to last a lot longer!","Negative"
"10091","Excellent value mother in law loves it.  It arrived without a power cord one call and it was on its way. You just can not beat Amazons customer service","Positive"
"10092","I think Alexa is great I get all the info I need just by speaking.","Positive"
"10093","We love Alexia! Great for music!","Positive"
"10094","Picked up my wireless perfectly, no problems, cannot believe it has all the answers..","Negative"
"10095","So far so good.  I'm still learning how to work her.  I am hoping that Alexa continues to adopt more apps as time goes by !!","Positive"
"10096","But she is awesome.  She wakes me up with a daily alarm.  And I love the thunderstorm sounds.  I hope you add more sounds !!","Positive"
"10097","I'm glad I bought her.","Positive"
"10098","very disappointed!!","Negative"
"10099","Very satisfied!  One of the best gifts I've ever given!!  Great experience with seller","Positive"
"10100","What a great purchase. I love buying refurbished!","Positive"
"10101","Best thing I've bought on amazon, hands down.  So good I bought two and am considering a third.","Positive"
"10102","It's more of a toy than a useful gadget. Hopefully, Amazon will continue to develop this toy into something worth buying.","Positive"
"10103","Purchased for 139 on a multi payment plan because I wasn't sure if I'd continue it after the novelty wore off. Even if I only use it to play Prime music, it is worth it. Was using a Soundlink with Pandora on my iPhone. Drawbacks to that comination was two devices to charge, separate subscription, and having to scroll through music choices ot build playlists. I have never been the type to collect CDs, download music or create my own playlists. With Alexa it is sooooo easy & only one Prime membership for movies and music. After doing voice training Alexa understands me well and can understand requests from across the room. The games sre fun. Just when it sound like she has gone off track during twenty questions, she gets it. We're talking 'is it made of metal?' to the correct 'is it a spider monkey?'. My Soundlink stopped working & Echo gave me tons more at a liwer price and equal audio quality.","Positive"
"10104","I returned this item once I did a side by side comparison to Google Home.  Google Home interprets your requests much better.  you can ask the same request worded three ways and it worked.  Echo need to have precise requests or can't help.  I also have an Echo Dot and find it far more versatile for 1/4 price.  Right now this is little better than an expensive bluetooth speaker.  I really want this to connect to my home stereo.  Yes, I know it has a speaker, but not as big sound or quality of a home audio system.  If you want an echo, buy the echo dot, maybe one for each bedroom as well.  We use our dot in place of a night radio, alarm clock, lists, reminders, weather.  Very versatile, but again Alexa, the underlying brain needs very specific formats/commands.  .","Positive"
"10105","What a great little toy!  Like music?  Ask Alexa to play your favorite music and it comes up instantly.  Ask her questions, make up shopping lists or have her control you appliances simply by talking to her.  Great addition to the house.","Positive"
"10106","I am having so much fun with this Echo known as Alexa. Still learning how to set her up correctly but what we have asked her so far has been a blast. I wish everyone had one as the music playing is great.","Positive"
"10107","I bought this for my wife's birthday. It is now used by everyone in the household. I just ordered some Echo Dots to expand throughout the house. I'm truly amazed at the speed in which Alexa can provide answers to questions.","Positive"
"10108","We're super pleased with our Amazon Echo. We use it daily for news, weather, controlling our lights with wifi plugs, checking our schedules, setting timers, asking for conversions, and listening to music through Spotify Connect. The voice recognition is better than Siri or Google. We use Alexa so much that we bought a Dot for another room.","Positive"
"10109","Grand kids use it constantly","Positive"
"10110","So much fun, and helpful!!!","Positive"
"10111","Amazing piece of hardware. I highly recommend it. There are new skills being  created every day. I can see echo taking over everyone's house in the future.","Positive"
"10112","Love it","Positive"
"10113","I cannot live without Alexa in my life.  It helps me perform seemingly simple chores, like making a shopping list, turning on my lights when my hands are full, turning my TV on and off.  Integrating with my security system, and so much more.  It's simple to use and novelty tricks like tell me a joke and what's the weather keeps the rest of my family entertained.","Positive"
"10114","this is a gift to be given at Christmas, so I can have the recipient provided more feedback - I liked the sale price","Positive"
"10115","Love my Alexa it's awesome","Positive"
"10116","We love our Amazon Echo.  I especially love being able to listen to no commercial music!  We recently added iHome plugs and now Alexa can turn on and off lights in our home.  The app also allows us to turn them on and off when we are away from home.  We added our security system on as well.  Several of our friends have bought one because ours has been so much fun and entertainment.  One thing I do wish, is that it  could be more current with sports scores, etc.  I love the shopping list feature!  Sometimes it is not convenient to be near pad and paper to write it down.  I open the app at the store and there is my list!","Positive"
"10117","good","Positive"
"10118","Im loving our echo! I just cant say enough good things about it!","Positive"
"10119","happy with her although she works better with prime.  always filling out the questionnaire to add more too her.  would like too hear the most popular answer not that I can go to bing and look it up.  I can do that on my own.","Positive"
"10120","Got this because I wanted a bluetooth speaker in the living room for when i'm cleaning or entertaining, and figured why not one I can talk to. Glad I did. I don't find it that ""usefull"" as much as a novelty, great conversation peice of tech, and makes me feel like I'm on the starship enterprise. I just wish I could call it ""computer"" instead of alexa to get it to respond.","Positive"
"10121","Stopped working after six months absolute junk","Negative"
"10122","Besides Alexa, the speakers also impressed me.","Positive"
"10123","I have a small Anker Bluetooth speaker and this Echo sounds so much better with better base.","Positive"
"10124","I bought these as gifts and the recipients love them.","Positive"
"10125","After 5 months, the Echo started to consistently lose its wifi connection. I emailed tech support. I went through a DOZEN trouble shooting steps. They all failed. The Echo is currently useless.","Negative"
"10126","I have a Dot connected to the same exact network without any issues. I have 15 wireless devices on the network without issues.  This is clearly a device specific issue.","Negative"
"10127","Sorry Amazon, but I'm done. No more Amazon devices for me. Either I get a replacement or I stop using your site. I put in 300 orders a year. You want to waste tens of hours of my time trying to troubleshoot your defective device?  Come on...","Negative"
"10128","Love my Echo.  The speaker is fantastic.  I've played music on it outside at parties and many people have commented that they thought I had surround sound speakers.  I play Jeopardy on her every day.  I also love that I can tell the Echo to put things on my shopping list or my to do list.  I bought everyone in my family one for Christmas.","Positive"
"10129","I have some issues with it staying connected but I still like it.","Negative"
"10130","I've been so impressed with this voice activated system that I've just purchased my third echo for yet another room!","Positive"
"10131","Make sure you check the Alexa App reviews in iTunes(I did not). The app is so bad Echo is useless. I have been trying for over an hour to get the app to load. I've turned my phone off-on, deleted and re-downloaded the app several times. For some reason it started working after turning off my cellular data while connected to WiFi??? Not sure if thats some kind of fix. Now that I have gotten into the app, it just keeps saying ""The Alexa app is offline..."". I haven't even been able to get past the ""Intro to Echo"" in the app. $140 paper weight! I have an iPhone 5S.","Negative"
"10132","I love Alexa. Even if she does torment me with too many Adele songs.","Negative"
"10133","our new voice communicator  everyone in the house uses it...great sound too","Positive"
"10134","Device speech recognition was really bad, it couldnt read me in a quiet room sometimes, I'm pretty sure I got a faulty one. The microphone stopped working all together. Waist of money.","Positive"
"10135","I find the most useful feature of alexa is to play music.  There is a discounted amazon music plan that allows you to access a huge music library (only on alexa).  I wish the base were more rich.  Other than that, she can do a lot of 'tricks'.  can't wait for the technology to advance further! I'm really happy with this thing.","Positive"
"10136","I'm really surprised at all that Alexa can do. Did you know that she can sing? Fun item to have around and I love that she can answer my questions about the stock market, news, weather. She can create grocery lists and pick your favorite music too.","Positive"
"10137","I love this thing! I have it in the kitchen and when I am cooking or washing dishes, I can ask for music, news, weather, whatever. No loading a CD or connecting my Ipod to a player. The living room is nearby, so I can hear it there too. Good sound and she even tells funny jokes!","Positive"
"10138","I really love my Echo and Dot.  BUT I wish it would respond to the following command:  ""Pause for 6 minutes"".  As things stand, I have to tell Alexa to ""Pause"", then command her to ""alarm in six minutes"".  Then when she plays the alarm, I have to tell her to end it, and then I have to tell her to Unpause.  Very cumbersome.","Negative"
"10139","Fantastic product! As advertised.","Positive"
"10140","It was fun at first.  I bought it last year.  Since then it seems to ""get"" dumber and dumber with each upgrade.  For example, it used to do animal sounds in response to my grandchildren's requests such as ""what does a dog say.""  Now it just responds, ""Sorry I only speak English at the moment.""  When asking basic questions most of the time I receive ""I don't know the answer but please check the bing page.""  If I wanted bing I would simply look it up on my laptop.  We've asked ""ok google"" the same questions and received the expected response.  Alexa is pretty much just a cutesy speaker for music.  If that's what you want, buy it.  If you want what Amazon promises, get Google.  This is coming directly from an Amazon fan.  I will remain a loyal Amazon customer, but felt it only fair to warn people not to expect much with Alexa.  It's a waste of money.","Positive"
"10141","Great","Positive"
"10142","If you're like most people you probably feel like you are missing your hand when you don't have your cellphone with you. I'm starting to feel the same way when I don't have Alexa near by. I've been watching the Amazon echo since the initial purchase invites for prime members. I couldn't convince myself $200.00 was worth what was being offered. fast forward 2 years later. I've been able to watch multiple reviews, and see extensive videos showing the full potential of this device. When the price dropped to $139.00 my love for tech and curiosity got the best of me. I pulled the trigger and purchased what I thought might end up being a fancy bluetooth speaker, which I really didn't need since I have a satellite surround sound system that is wireless and runs off of bluetooth. Now after a few months of use I can say that Alexa has grown on me and become something I use through out the day. An amazing apspect of this device is Alexa knows what I am saying without precise verbage. My Camaro I have to use precise commands nd speak after appropriate prompts. Talking to Alexa is natural. No pauses aftee waking her with the trigger name ""Alexa"". I started with listening to music and found that no matter what I wanted to listen to she could find it in seconds. I started using the daily flash briefing daily, adding and checking calendar reminders. I used the timers when I was cooking I'd just walk off and watch TV. Then I started using the shopping lists to add things I needed to pick up at the grocery store. I started checking the weather more often and traffic pattern for my commute to work. I've used Alexa to check facts and pull info from wikki. I love that I can connect my bluetooth devices just by saying Alexa connect ""bluetooth device"". I can listen to my news stations when I get home instead of just in the car on the way home. With in a week I was in a routine with Alexa. I'm noticing that I'm fumbling with my cellphone less and less these days.I noticed that the 2nd generation dots were on sale and wanting to get the most out of my echo I purchased 3, and 2 TP Link smart plugs. I now have my living room lights and bedroom lights set up on my echo. I can control any set of lights from any of the rooms now. I typically come home with my hands full and it's nice just to tell Alexa to turn the living room lights instead of struggling for the switch. If I go to bed and forget to turn off the living room lights I just tell my dot to do it from the bedroom. I like being able to turn my lights on and off from my bed without reaching for  lamp in the dark or walking across the room. It's now habbit for me to cut the lights off using Alexa by voice as I go to sleep. I've also stopped using my alarm clock and use the dot in my bedroom now. My wake up times change from day to day and it's so much easier telling Alexa to set the time then fumbling with my alarm clock. I also like that I can tell Alexa to stop the alarm rather then fumbling for the switch, and the alarm is much more pleasing to wake up to. ***Update*** I bought a Harmony Hub and have my TV, surround sound, and Roku set up. I also have my PS4 and Gbox Q inputs set up when the tv and surround sound wake. It's awesome everything I want on at one time and off at one time. My Roku will even go straight to my Amazon movies. I can even have everything turned on or off in the living room from my dot in the bedroom. Honestly the Harmony hub is really a pain to set up and I have not trained it to do anything other than turn my devices off and on. I'm still pleased with the devices. At first my wife was hesitant to accept Alexa, she was surprised the first time Alexa said ""Hi"" to her and still using the light switches to turn off the lights. Now I see her using Alexa more often, slowly Alexa is becoming a part of her daily routine. I missed Alexa so much when I was at work I ended up buying another Echo dot for work, and now enjoy having all the benefits at work and home. This product is a big thumbs up and the price for the dots right now make this purchase an easily affordable one for Christmas presents. I've now bought one for most of my family.","Positive"
"10143","We love Alexa!! I don't know what else to say other than it has been so fun to have in our home. We mostly use it for the music and timer, but the fun facts and noises are a great addition.","Positive"
"10144","I'm very impressed with Amazon Echo. Both my wife and I use Alexa daily and there are a variety of skills available for Alexa to use. It was an easy process to set the Echo up and we haven't experienced real problems in its use. Even my six year old grandson uses Alexa to play music he likes.","Positive"
"10145","I recently purchased the wifi electrical outlets that work with Alexa. Again the installation was simple and they work perfectly.","Positive"
"10146","Arrived quickly, no hassle.  Love it!  Thank you!","Positive"
"10147","Love it!  Purchased this one for a gift but have used one previously.","Positive"
"10148","I have had this for a couple of months now and I find that it is getting progressively worse at hearing me. It is now to the point where I have say my command 3-4 times before it understands me. This is extremely frustrating. I hope Google Home does a better job hearing me.","Positive"
"10149","Omg, this thing is AMAZING!  And fun! We are def getting our $$$ worth out of it.  We have created ""scenes"" that incorporate our Control4 system. Music? Yes! Lightening? Yes!  HVAC? Yes!  Security? Yes! Alexa is def apart of our family now. :)","Positive"
"10150","Definitely worth the money.  Love it","Positive"
"10151","This product is simply amazing. It is only in its infancy at the moment, but it is an exciting glimpse of what the future holds. Alexa is the centerpiece of my smart home that includes Nest, Skydrop, Wemo, LifX and Harmony. She integrates with all of them very well. Keep up the good work, Amazon, and continue making Alexa better.","Positive"
"10152","This device was everything I had hoped for and more. I am still learning everything it does, I am not disappointed at all, I would never have know it was a refurbished unit.","Negative"
"10153","LOVE our Echo, we use it almost everyday!","Positive"
"10154","Same as my first one. Works well but the documentation did not match the unit.  Called the help desk and they heled me connect with my wifi.","Positive"
"10155","LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE, we use this daily and really enjoy all the skills.","Positive"
"10156","THIS WORKS GREAT FOR AN TRIVIA QUESTION OR MUSIC YOU WANT PLAYED. LOVE IT.","Positive"
"10157","LOVE IT!!","Positive"
"10158","Love Echo","Positive"
"10159","Far from as intelligent as advertised, much less so than Siri! I may return it! This is a glorified toy right now! Maybe in the future it will be updated enough to be worthwhile, but I do not recommend it! The big problem is, this will update for a year of two, but it is going to be the second or third generation device that will start to actually be smart, and that will require buying a new unit, as this one will not update beyond a certain point! I suggest waiting!","Positive"
"10160","I love the Echo!  Alexa is full of information and she just keeps getting better.","Positive"
"10161","Its a life changer.  Makes things around the house simpler and more fun.","Positive"
"10162","For refurbished echo, it works great. Still learning about and sure that I get echo account all set up , hopefully it will know answers to everything....LOL.","Positive"
"10163","After initially hesitating buying the Echo, I was really excited when it arrived.  After finding all the fun easter eggs in addition the normal commands we really enjoyed it for the first week.  Then, I started to think I was never going to use it.  We have the Echo in our kitchen and it seemed once the fun wore off I'd regret the purchase.  But I was wrong.  I couldn't live a day without Alexa now.  While I mostly use it for music, having it there has been wonderful.  We don't have it integrated with lights or our thermostat, but it still comes in so handy!","Positive"
"10164","My only complaints would be 1):  as she ages, she's getting heard of hearing; and 2): wish we could customize the wake-up command and her voice.  Surprisingly, my 19-year-old son loves it as much as I do.  I even ordered him the Echo Dot for Christmas!  I have had no issues with the refurbished unit and it works like new!  I would definitely recommend the Echo!","Positive"
"10165","I loved my echo so my sister asked me to order one for her husband for Christmas. The AI works great and 99% of the time does what I ask it do. The wide range of what this little speaker can do is amazing. Great sound quality as well.","Positive"
"10166","I love this thing.  I just ordered 2 echo dots! One for my family room and one for the ex husband for Christmas","Positive"
"10167","REALLY NICE PIECE. CRYSTAL CLEAR AUDIO. SHE LEARNS AS YOU GO. PAIRED HER WITH MY WEMO SMART PLUG AND PLUGGED MY LAMP INTO HER...WORKS WELL.","Positive"
"10168","Sound is good, does everything as advertised, good product!","Positive"
"10169","I love it. Truly does hear you from across the room and great quality speakers. Would still recommend even if you don't have a smart house.","Positive"
"10170","Can't live without it now, it's like part of the family","Positive"
"10171","love my Echo!  always handy when I have a question or need music!!","Positive"
"10172","Love my echo!  Everyone who comes to our home loves Alexa!  I just bought a book on what more I can do so I'm excited to read it.","Positive"
"10173","Very pleased with the Amazon Echo.  The sound is great.  It has not let us down so far.  We are slowly adding the smart home devices and really enjoying all the conveniences.","Positive"
"10174","Great electronic gadget I have bought seven for gifts.","Positive"
"10175","We love our echo.","Positive"
"10176","Great item, it is so portable and nice, and was a good gift, i like it.","Positive"
"10177","Glad we purchsed. Alexa is a big hit in our house. Mainly for listing to music, but has other uses also.","Positive"
"10178","Everyone loves the Echo.  Kids and their friends are constantly chatting with Alexa.  Skills continue to be added, it is amazing what she can do.","Positive"
"10179","Wow the best way to describe Alexa is pretty much watch terminator. This is the start of skynet as long as she doesn't kill me things will be great. Best thing I've ever bought","Positive"
"10180","a must have","Positive"
"10181","The unit arrived nicely boxed. It was in like new condition. This is one of the most fun gadgets you can buy. It is a ton of fun talking with Alexa. It took only a few minutes to set up with my Fire tablet and the Alexa app. It just doesn't get any easier to use with voice commands. Super easy to set timers and alarms. In combination with my fire tablet it helps keep me on schedule. Feeling down, ask Alexa to tell you a joke. You can ask Alexa for all sorts of information, weather, news, time, temperature, size of the Earth. Alexa easily converts units of measure. Want to hear some music just ask Alexa to play some 80s rock music. Alexa's vocabulary and skills are growing daily. Definitely a lot of fun. With additional accessories, Alexa can turn lights on and off as well as set the temperature of your home. This device has a great deal of potential.","Positive"
"10182","This is the most fun I've had with my clothes on.  Love love love it, so much fun to play with and so very functional as well.  All the skills it has make many things so easy","Positive"
"10183","How I ever lived without her. She is as important to me as my cell phone!!!!! Talk to her many times a day. She reminds me what I need to shop for, she reminds me of my schedule and what I have to do. She keeps me posted as to my Amazon orders, and she plays all the music I love....and so much more! Thank you Alexa!!!!","Positive"
"10184","How bout you don't put a label on the box that says what's inside. Maybe I wanted it to be a surprise for christmas","Positive"
"10185","This just plain works. Best application I've found is the integration with the Belkin WeMo switches. Despite some of the reviews I've seen, Alexa loves these switches.","Positive"
"10186","love it","Positive"
"10187","Amazing.","Positive"
"10188","When I got this I thought it was a competitor of Siri, Google Home and other Artificial Intelligence devices. It is not AI, and it does not learns you. You have to learn the instructions. 99% of the times I give it one single instruction: Play Pop. I get Joan Sebastian Bach, Bob Marlin, and plenty of other things 6 times out of 10. It does other things, but just annoying to have to learn it instead of having it learn from you.","Positive"
"10189","Other than that, good speaker.","Positive"
"10190","Great","Positive"
"10191","Greatest thing since sliced bread!!!! I love it take the time and use the free app.You cant go wrong this thing does just about anything and they add more all the time LOVE IT!!!!!","Positive"
"10192","LOVE IT!!","Positive"
"10193","Works well. Sound is acceptable for a single small speaker. Good for background music in an average size room.","Positive"
"10194","First of all, I have to compliment the Customer Service Reps for Amazon - they are the best - the Echo takes a wee bit of setting up because there are some issues one has to deal with getting use to it - the sound is fantastic - each morning, I ask Alexa to play one of my favorite artists and it does wonders for the mental attitude - the only thing that disappoints me is that Amazon did not consider the possibility that the user might want to use the audio book feature to listen to their favorite books in bed - I have a large Kindle library and most of the books are available in an audio format - however, I can't use them without disturbing my wife - also, Alexa reads the books fast and, since many of my books are on ancient history, the speed of her reading makes it difficult to digest the material - I've been informed that Amazon is working on correcting these items and will hope for a solution in the not too distant future","Positive"
"10195","I enjoy speaking and learning more about Alexa each day. Everyone should own an Amazon Echo. FYI...hands free speaking and lots of fun.","Positive"
"10196","The best gift ever , the whole family just has the most fun with Alecia.","Positive"
"10197","Excellent system.  High quality sound and quite a capable device.","Positive"
"10198","My wife and I are having far too much fun in asking Alexa to ""do"" things. Currently we are asking her to play music -- String Quartets/GlennMiller/60's Rock/.... A great selection. Plus, we have uploaded a number of our favorites recorded many years ago... Plus, it is great to ask Alexa to set a timer -- ""Alexa, set a timer for 10 minutes from now.""  We are old enough to not remember that something needs to be accomplished in 10 minutes from now (;>). Several of our friends, after interacting with our Alexa, have bought both Echo and Dots. They too, are having far too much fun with a smart player. Thanks Amazon!","Positive"
"10199","I love my Amazon echo !","Positive"
"10200","Absolutely awesome product. I got this for my home theater setup so I can use it with Harmony and it works absolutely flawless. It's really nice because all my wife has to do is walk in and do voice commands and everything within my home theater setup will easily be controlled by Harmony and the Amazon Echo. I highly recommend this for anybody who likes hands-free functionality for all your home theater and pretty much any other needs.","Positive"
"10201","Given with the battery base as a gift and they are still downloading and raving about it.","Negative"
"10202","Owned for a year now. What would I do without it?  When I am having a hard time getting up and don't want to move even a finger in my warm comfy bed I ask and get answers to ""Alexa what is the weather today? Alexa did Green Bay win last night? Alexa give me the latest news (the one that leaves out ""celebrities""). Then I usually ask Alexa to play a song, dependent on the answers to those questions, that moves me to get out of bed and dance. : )  Gave as gift to elderly relative who lives alone and she learned quickly how to Echo her for jokes and trivia games and spelling and in a strange way, but no doubt the way of our future, for companionship.","Positive"
"10203","LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!","Positive"
"10204","love Alexa","Positive"
"10205","Do I get a refund?  I just purchased this for $179","Positive"
"10206","great value and product","Positive"
"10207","My favorite command thus far: ""Alexa, read me the news!""","Positive"
"10208","We were looking for a bluetooth speaker for the kitchen, noticed that Alexa was having a birthday and the price was very reasonable, and decided to give her a try. We don't use it as much as we thought (I still use my Okay Google commands for productivity), but I love listening to my custom news feed in the mornings while I get coffee and breakfast going for the family. My wife loves it to play her music (which is why we were in the market for a BT speaker in the first place), and the kids love the more silly skills that Alexa has to offer... you'll know what I'm talking about if you do just a small bit of exploring in the skills library. :P","Positive"
"10209","This is a good little item but Alexa seems to have a lot of problems getting answers----i.e, what ingredients are on a rueben sandwich----what is the height of an average 3 year old girl.  Only got this recently and for the most part it is good...love  the music... love the weather report..... but either us or Alexa needs to do better on answers-or how we ask the question?","Positive"
"10210","Great addition to our home technology. Good speaker for background music.  love the lists options.","Positive"
"10211","Great job Amazon.. Love this thing.. Sound quality is pretty good..","Positive"
"10212","Still has a bit to go on being fully interactive. Needs to take on some abilities that Google home has.","Positive"
"10213","Amazon Echo is the best. Quality product and nice new design.","Positive"
"10214","Very good Device! I love it and it's working really well. I ask about things all the time, The device is pretty accurate:)","Positive"
"10215","Love it","Positive"
"10216","Use all the time. very good sound for the size.","Positive"
"10217","So far it's a wonderful addition to our home. Clear sound, responsive, and very flexible.","Positive"
"10218","Some timed i think the mics dont here me but i love my alexa","Positive"
"10219","Bought for 3rd one.  Work great in everyroom.","Positive"
"10220","Fun product with great ability to pick up different accents provided the words are clearly spoken.  Sound is fairly good but don't expect Sonos or Bose quality sound from the Echo.","Positive"
"10221","So far, very disappointing.  It can hardly hear me in the same room.  And situation does not appear to be isolated to just this one unit as I purchased two units at the same time.","Negative"
"10222","Love it. Set it up last night. Took more that expected to get set up. I ordered the dot also and seems that it is the app that is giving some problems. But after I got off of wifi and went to cell data it seem to go quicker. Had the alarm set up this morning to wake me and it did. So far grate product. Will work with it more this weekend in case I need to re-review the product. Both came packed together and was a grate packing job. Shipping we right on time also.","Positive"
"10223","WE LOVE YOU ALEXA! My family loves Alexa. She makes our store lists. She tells us the weather. She gives us movie times. She orders our amazon purchases. She shares witty jokes with us. One of the best birthday gifts my husband has purchased for me. BTW... the Tough Guy app (Chuck Norris) is worth the purchase alone.","Positive"
"10224","Check out the Echo Dot as it has blue tooth for remote speakers BUT if you have no blue tooth speakers get this sounds great","Positive"
"10225","I have become addicted to Alexa. We use her every single day. She tells us the weather for the day, makes my shopping lists, keeps time for my kids' timed reading homework, orders my pizza, tells me who that actor is in that episode of the show that I am watching, and most importantly, she plays me music. So much music. Good sound, by the way. And she has great range. We have a large, open-concept house. We put Alexa as close as we could to the center, and she can hear us call to her from the entire downstairs and part of the upstairs. Impressive. We're currently shopping for Alexa-enabled light and power switches. I suspect this is as close as I'm going to get to having the computer from the starship Enterprise.","Positive"
"10226","worst product app for setup not available on amazon app store and not compatible on google play. hoping those responsible willbe sweeping floors until fixed","Positive"
"10227","i have a 200 dollar paper weight with a pretty light on top. the fact that this is even sold should be be investigated.","Positive"
"10228","Great speaker streams music nicely from prime. Turns lights on or off. Streams same cyber Monday newscast every day for two weeks even though I have heard it already. Why because that newscast hails Alexa as a great gift.","Positive"
"10229","Alexa is really a toy not ready for prime time built to sell amazon products. Every week an email tells me how much more capable Alexa is at ordering toilet paper etc.","Positive"
"10230","When Alexa realizes she played a podcast yesterday and skips to the next one up, I'll be impressed.","Positive"
"10231","Setup is unclear on network security","Negative"
"10232","I love my echo!  The sound quality is great. I do not feel the need to connect this one to a Bluetooth.  Love asking about the weather or new and sports update!  Amazon unlimited music is awesome.  I only wish Alexa was able to play the playlists I have made.","Positive"
"10233","Alexa is our go to ""person"" for almost everything.  Good sound and exceptionally useful.  Traffic, weather, trivia, you name it, Alexa provides it.","Positive"
"10234","CAN'T PLAY MUSIC on multiple Echo's/computers,etc.  You have to setup a completely separate account for each device in order to listen to music at the same time on each device.  Every time you have a device play it will turn off any other device that is playing. Don't think you can buy multiple devices and play them at the same time in different rooms of your home.","Positive"
"10235","Was worried about ordering a refurbished item, but honestly, works great. Love how Alexa controls our lights, tv and gives us weather updates, tells a daily joke and can ask random questions for food ideas, order items from amazon, play games and music. Sound quality it great and easy for multiple people to use.","Positive"
"10236","Love Alexa! She can hear us easily, great speaker!","Positive"
"10237","My personal assistant, Alexa is the best! Keeps track of all my tasks. Alexa does not hear your command if the volume is high.","Positive"
"10238","Wow...Wow...and Wow.  This thing is really handy and fun.","Positive"
"10239","Great gift.  I love all the things i can tell her to do for me and she does it.","Positive"
"10240","A friend of mine told me I should buy an Echo...she was right.  I am having lots of fun with it, as a lover of learning and asking questions!","Positive"
"10241","This is one of my favorite things of 2016.  It's amazing. It understands every member of my family, manages our shopping lists, orders new stuff from Amazon, reads the news, plays music, orders pizza... seriously?  It's amazing.  Once you get used to interacting with Echo, you'll want to put Hue or Wemo lights in all of your sockets so you never have to flip a switch again.  I can control my lighting, music, news... everything with my voice thanks to Alexa.  She's literally the first person I talk to every morning, and the last person I talk to every night.","Positive"
"10242","My Amazon echo is amazing.  She tells me a tidbit of factual information or historical facts every morning when I tell her good morning.  She gives detailed weather information.  She details my work commute traffic.  She sets alarms for me, adds to my grocery list and plays all the music I enjoy.  I am still learning new things every day about Alexa and Alexa is also adding new things every day which is making her even more useful.  My favorite thing is being able to have her turn on and off my Philips Hue lights in each room.  And my other favorite thing is she gives me all of the Chicago Bears scores and updates","Positive"
"10243","Excellent product and so much fun!","Positive"
"10244","I lose using this, it's so clear and surround sound!","Negative"
"10245","I loved this when I first got it and I still like it but it seems like the updates are lagging behind from a real improvement standpoint. Alexa seems to know less not more. I get way too many, ""I don't understand the question I heard"".  If you're not careful Amazon, Google will leave you in the dust after starting years behind you.","Positive"
"10246","Don't continue to disappoint me.","Negative"
"10247","I use it daily! Even to just check the weather or get a news update! Significantly better than Siri! Very loud, the music is very crisp! She always hears and respond when you say Alexa! Great purchase you should totally buy it","Positive"
"10248","Bought one a few months ago and absolutely love it.  I bought another one for my Mom for Christmas.","Positive"
"10249","I use it daily.  Extremely helpful for timers, daily alarms, etc.  Reasonable free music selection.","Positive"
"10250","BUT, consider buying the SquareTrade warranty.  The wall-mount power supply for the Echo just died after 13 months; the basic warranty only lasts a year.  The Echo is OK; I connected its cable to another supply, and it booted.  PS replacement cost: $20.  Warranty cost: $30.","Negative"
"10251","Echo is awesome! My daughter and I enjoyed features, especially the music.  I do like the voice of Alexa.  I would recommend this product to my friends.","Positive"
"10252","I cannot say how much I enjoy this speaker. I have taught my grandmother how to check the local weather with it, granted she calls Lexi, Alexis, and other similar names. I have to remind her it is Alexa, lol. In all seriousness though I find this to be wonderful. It has many features that I know and many more that I learn as time goes on. Great idea for many people for the holiday. I especially like how accurate it pulls information. I would recommend this for someone with bad eyesight to enjoy things like fast weather updates, and many more things as it expands.","Positive"
"10253","I love it!!!!","Positive"
"10254","I love my ECHO!  I wish I could get one for every level of my home!","Positive"
"10255","Awesome!!!","Positive"
"10256","We were introduced to the Echo by our daughter, Purchased one for ourselves and have enjoyed it from the time we got it.  It took us a short while to figure out how to do the start up routine, but once ""on line"" we enjoy it regularly.","Positive"
"10257","Great little device for the home. Seri is much smarter, so be very specific in what you ask her. The surround speakers are great","Positive"
"10258","Set up instructions consisted of two small pages.  Easy to download software to home iPad.  Speaker has good quality and Alexa has all the answers.  She is great in the kitchen with recipes and setting timers.  I really enjoy the music.  I'm still learning all it can do.","Positive"
"10259","I bought it as a gift and they love it.  No problems so far with it.","Positive"
"10260","Arrived fast, it was my first time buying anything refurbished, to my delight it looked and played like a brand new echo. Great sound I was not disappointed.","Positive"
"10261","We are loving our Amazon Echo. Everyday we find more things it can do. Fun!","Positive"
"10262","The sound quality is decent, but the best interface for playing music is through the Spotify app because Alexa is so frustrating. My wife and I unplugged it and put it away in favor of the Google Home.","Positive"
"10263","I love my Echo. I can pick up many of my local stations on TuneIn. I ordered 4 for Christmas gifts.","Positive"
"10264","So handy I like it better than the tap since it's hands free and partners so easily with Amazon prime content","Positive"
"10265","Amazing does what it was ment to do having lots of fun to","Positive"
"10266","I love, love, love, my Amazon Echo!!! The sound is so clear and crisp! ""Alexa"" has such a fun personality, she's quite playful! It's fun to ask random questions to see how she'll answer. I love that new capabilities are being added on a regular basis. I'm so pleased with this purchase!","Positive"
"10267","I love my Alexa!! Some of the apps are very useful. The music is what I am really impressed with.","Positive"
"10268","We like Alexa but need more instruction on how to bring out the best in her.","Positive"
"10269","So far so good.","Positive"
"10270","sometimes it does not responded, but other then that, we like it very much","Positive"
"10271","It's get confusing when try to get it to do things","Negative"
"10272","works sometimes, does not play pandora well, lessons sometimes and sometime does not respond at all","Positive"
"10273","Alexa can so rarely recognize me calling her name that I frequently find myself yelling at her, especially when music is playing. And if she does hear me while nothing is playing, there's no auditory feedback, so I can't tell if I should continue with my voice command unless I'm looking directly at the echo. Usually when I get past the wake word, the voice recognition works more than half the time. But if Alexa can't understand what you said while music is playing, instead of waiting to hear a response from you, she rudely turns the music back up, and you have to repeat the wake word another 6 times to try to get a command in edgewise. Irritatingly, she will wake up at random and answer a gibberish question no one asked, apparently because she overheard something in the room. It's just not a great user experience.","Positive"
"10274","I can't believe just how great Alexia is, good tool","Positive"
"10275","It's fun learning what Alexa can do... even got the weather this morning.","Positive"
"10276","I'm very satisfied with my purchase of this refurbished Alexa. Unit was easy to set up and has continued to work flawlessly. Alexa continues to provide us with great sounding Christmas music during this Holiday Season.","Positive"
"10277","I use this for lots of home automation (Sprinklers, lighting, home theater, thermostat, music, etc.).  I have the dot as well.  Love the capabilities and integration with lots of products/technology that I use.","Positive"
"10278","They are awesome I wished I would have waited until they were on sale ndIwould have bought a couple of them","Positive"
"10279","There's nothing negative I can say about this product at all. Very good, does a lot and very convenient!","Positive"
"10280","Love it!","Positive"
"10281","Exceeded our expectations and the set up was easy for those of us who remember Pearl Harbor.  We use Alexa daily","Positive"
"10282","Good as advertised","Positive"
"10283","Alexia is a big help in the kitchen, always providing entertainment.","Positive"
"10284","I am absolutely in love with Alexa and my Echo! As a parent of two kiddos with special needs, Alexa has my back. From alarms to remind me of medications to playing my favorite song, Alexa is there for me. I did a side by side comparison between the echo and google home, and hands down echo outperforms.","Positive"
"10285","This is a great product. Easy set up. Easy to use. In one short week it has been a pleasure to have a house filled with music and entertainment. Very highly recommended. I have already order additional Echo Dots to expand the Echo environment throughout my home. My 4 year old daughter also enjoys the stories and kids music. She taught herself how to use this in the first 3 minutes have I had it connected.","Positive"
"10286","I purchased the Amazon Echo as a gift for my elderly parents (ages 86 and 90).  It had become difficult for them to use their stereo and the Amazon Echo brings them so much enjoyment every day.  They listen to the news, and music from their childhood to current music, they sing along, they dance, it's just wonderful!  The perfect gift!","Positive"
"10287","Great product. Great sound system!","Positive"
"10288","At first just an expensive toy but now I'm finding the Echo to be an alternative to going to the internet on phone to search everything. Super easy to set up and use. I paired it with my iPhone and can stream music easily. Sound is great! Wish you could pick your own name as Garth Brooks commercial always turns it on!!!","Positive"
"10289","As good as Advertised!","Positive"
"10290","This is a gift that won't be opened until Christmas!","Positive"
"10291","Fun product. Easy to set up. Jokes lame.","Positive"
"10292","still trying to get it to do certain things but its fun and worth the money","Positive"
"10293","I do not find the sound quality to be good; perhaps this is because it was refurbished?  It does work pretty well, but I do not think it's as great as the ads and hype make it out to be.  You can't be too far from the unit for it to properly hear what you are asking.","Positive"
"10294","Amazing! Love having Alexa in my life","Positive"
"10295","Love my Echo, now that someone programed it for me.","Positive"
"10296","Sound quality is excellent!","Positive"
"10297","I know the ""Dot"" will be great for the bedroom","Positive"
"10298","love it love it","Positive"
"10299","I'm living in the Dominican Republic so I can't use all the services Alexa provides. (for example order at dominos) But this is an awesome device. I cook a lot at home. You can ask for timers and convert units just by asking. Its really cool. I also control all my light (Philips hue). It works just perfect and also dimming is fantastic to ask for. Way better than with Siri what I used before. Also the range of voice recognition is fantastic. The device is placed on my table in the living room. When I enter my apartment and ask for the entrance lights to turn on it works all the time. And this at a distance for about 7 meters. Also to play music its a wonderful device. Sound is great for what it is and loud enough for all my uses. Fast shipping as usual from amazon.","Positive"
"10300","arrived timely works beautifully!","Positive"
"10301","The BEST addition to our family this year. My 3 year old and 1 year old love having music on and the Alexa makes it so easy to change our minds and please everyone by the time breakfast is done. It's fun, it's easy, what is not to love? It's a little challenging for poor Alexa to understand a 3 year old who can't correctly pronounce the letters L, R, V, U and TH but she sure has fun trying to deceiver his commands.","Positive"
"10302","My daughter loves it","Positive"
"10303","Great product.  Works very well and has an excellent speaker to boot.","Positive"
"10304","Great Product....I love it! It may not have all the answers but I enjoy using it.","Positive"
"10305","Love, Love, Love Echo!  I do wish I could change it to a male voice & name though.  ;)","Positive"
"10306","Love my Echo!","Positive"
"10307","Love having access to all kinds of music!","Positive"
"10308","Great product, lots of fun and the sound is really good.","Positive"
"10309","What's NOT to love about Alexa.  She is a great addition to my home.  The shopping list is wonderful, she helps me spell, do math and sings to me.  I again say what's NOT to love.","Positive"
"10310","Product came as described. Great Value.","Positive"
"10311","It was not possible to connect the echo with my Wifi, I try different devices (Iphone, Notebook, Android), nothing works. The amazon service try to help me, but no success","Positive"
"10312","LOVEEEE MY ALEXA!!! Still learning everything it can do but it's sooo convenient for playing music at home and for checking the weather etc","Positive"
"10313","Alexa was amusing for a while.  However, we never found it to be all that useful. For one thing, the voice recognition has clearly been trained by the 12-year olds who work in tech; it recognizes my teen son's commands very well, but has never understand me or my husband.  We tried many of the functions, like the shopping list. Often the voice recognition was poor and resulted in somewhat entertaining items on the grocery list, but not a useful shopping list.  We have had Alexa for 1 year, 9 months, and it is now completely dead, and out of the warranty period. We will not buy another one.","Positive"
"10314","Mom had a problem reaching a pull chain to turn on an overhead ceiling fan light. I thought this might be the perfect solution....and it is! I installed two outlet controls, one for the fan light, and another for the bedroom table lamp. Now when Mom enters the bedroom or wakes in the middle of the night she can turn the light on. When she is ready for bed she simple tells Alexa to turn out the light and she doesn't need to make those few steps in the dark. The fan light works equally well. She loves them both. The ""extra"" was how much she enjoys turning on music or setting a timer to make sure she doesn't over-bake the cake in the oven.","Positive"
"10315","it is extremely frustrating.  Won it an an auction and spent more money and time making it try to work.  Wish I resold it on ebay.","Positive"
"10316","Don't know if this has been mentioned before but I find that Alexa seems to work off keywords, example: Alexa, What is the weather, Just say Alexa, weather, this works for me a lot, just say Alexa, calendar, time, well you get picture. Also works for smart plugs, Just say name name of your device, Alexa, example bug light On/Off.","Positive"
"10317","I think Alexa is cool as it can be, as it is very good at speech recognition, a lot better than Cortana in Windows 10 which brings me to my main reason for writing this review, the very same technology that is in Echo will be in Windows 10 next year next to Cortana, starting in March (Redstone 2 update) it will be called Home Hub, yes it will do it all, smart plugs too. Will update it further update it with Redstone 3, then update when warranted.","Positive"
"10318","OMG!!!...GET THIS THING!...I had no troubles hooking up...sounds awesome in my kitchen corner...plays what ever I tell her to play from my spotify account....you can ask her just about anything!....weather...measurements...jokes...turn on and off diff things with the right compatability equipment...that will tell you on the boxes when you purchase! ...my girlfriend I think is jealous cause I say her name more than hers!!","Negative"
"10319","A little more maturation is needed. It can't detect some iris devices. It also is only able to link to a single calendar. So either me or my wife must go without our calendar. No remote mics so either carry the voice remote or move the device to the room you occupy. Does not connect to anything external such as speakers or your computer for questions regarding files and such. More expensive than the dot, less functionality. Even the dot Payton lyrics to a single device, so if you want music in the shower and then the bedroom have two of everything or take it and speaker with you.","Positive"
"10320","My new best friend!!!!!","Positive"
"10321","Had to order a second Echo as I was tired of looking all around the house to find where my original one was hiding. I put labels on the new one ""Do not touch!"" It stays in my office and no one has been brave enough to attempt moving it.","Positive"
"10322","I love my echo and am so glad I bought it. Music from the internet or my phone (via Bluetooth) sound amazing. Very useful and convenient addition to my home.","Positive"
"10323","I've had an Echo and two Dots for the last year and as they're becoming more popular, they're also beginning to show some problems.  The Echo server has gone down three times this month, and after investing money into quite a bit of hardware to work with the Echo, I'm beginning to feel a little bit like I've been taken for a ride.  When the server goes down these products are completely useless (as an example, earlier this month it was down for almost an entire day; it's already been down for four hours that I'm aware of today).  Had I known that this was going to be a continual issue, I would have thought twice about spending the amount of money I have.  I recommend to anyone interested in buying an Echo or a Dot to do some research and see how often these server issues continue to happen; I'm predicting as the numbers of people buying an Echo continue to grow, the servers are going to become more and more overloaded and this will be a continual issue.","Positive"
"10324","I bought the Echo for my father who is in a nursing home. Mentally he is all there but physically he needs assistance. I thought this would be a perfect companion but it took me awhile to learn commands and skills so we kept it at home while we learned. Our next issue was it could easily come up missing or be knocked off the table (as lamps have). When I read about Echo Dot, I thought it'd be perfect for Christmas (I bought 6) but I couldn't wait that long. My father, 79, has been enjoying ""Alexa"" for a few months and I'm so glad I didn't wait for Christmas. We are keeping a Dot for our bedroom.....and since I love them so much I bought more to give away! Perfect Christmas present for all on my list, from ages 6 to 80. My only complaint is my husband likes to take over and has a difficult time sharing! :)","Positive"
"10325","Great speaker. Great microphone.","Positive"
"10326","Love my Echo. My son hooked up Bluetooth so I can play my music that's on my phone thru Echos speakers. I  asked it to play music of the 80 etc.  I set alarms, ask Echo what's on my calendar for the week. It's great to say put something on your Shopping list especially when you are cooking and can't text it in. The speakers sound great.","Positive"
"10327","Most amazing device ever made on earth. Very good sound quality and mainly excellent reception even when the volume is so high. Alexa understands your slang, stores it in its database which helps it to understand your words more easily the next time you say the same word.","Positive"
"10328","Love this thing! And everywhere I take it, people fall in love with it, too. My favorite use is music on demand.","Positive"
"10329","Great sound and voice recognition. Similar knowledge limitations to Siri but I am sure it will continue to develop. So easy to use and fun.","Positive"
"10330","Even Alexa believes in Santa Claus.  Just ask, my grandson did and was not disappointed.  We love our Alexa, she plays games, answers questions and turns out the lights.  She has a sense of humor and tells corny jokes that entertain us all.  I am amazed at all the skills she can learn.  I have recommended the Echo or the dot to everyone I know.","Positive"
"10331","An innocent question in the setup of a shared PRIME account on Alexa results in the loss of PRIME privilidges for 180 days! The ECHO account sharing feature has a BOBBYTRAP that is most beneficial only to Amazon.","Positive"
"10332","Love the Echo. My husband who is in poor health is able to listen to music all night long.","Negative"
"10333","We recieved one as a gift. Initially we had fun seeing what it could do. Unfortunately the only useful function it really has is playing music. And recently that function has been buggy, with problems finding music and controlling volume. As a software developer I even tried to write a ""skill"" for the device but Amazon demands that developers PAY AMAZON to write free skills for either own platform. Needless to say I quit trying to help them.","Positive"
"10334","Additionally, during the time I've had the three products, I can't say the capabilities have expanded all that much.  Alexa has become more compatible with different hardware, but verbal interactions continue to be basic and pretty crude; as an example, you can't ask Alexa two questions in a row re: the same thought, as the Echo can't hold the information to connect the two questions together and will state it doesn't understand you.  It would also be really useful if Amazon could create more trigger words to awaken the Echo, as ""Alexa,"" ""Echo,"" and ""Amazon"" start to become very monotonous, as well as the continual ""Okay"" when it completes a task (for about a week last year it suddenly responded with a tone instead, which sounded a lot more sophisticated, but then it abruptly switched back to ""Okay."").  At times it reacts and sounds much like a kid's toy.","Positive"
"10335","Love alexa. She makes things easier","Positive"
"10336","Purchased as a gift.","Positive"
"10337","A little disappointed in this to be honest.","Positive"
"10338","Love my echo! Best most used purchase this year. Everyone needs one. Reads audible books while my kids soak in the tub. Favorite music at your beckon call! Helps with common core math-lol. Love my echo. Want the dots for all the rooms in my home:)","Positive"
"10339","Still working on how to get the most out of her. She takes basic commands well but is not super informative in a lot of things.  Perhaps not doing things or loading her right","Positive"
"10340","this is a christmas gift","Positive"
"10341","Sound is great but this system  is not ready for full integration into a whole house sound system - it will not coonect to a Bluetooth speaker or receiver (the dot does, the echo doesn't .... ??)","Positive"
"10342","Hopefully Amazon will realize the unnecessary limitations they put into this thing ... or Google home will be my next stop as soon as they catch up.","Negative"
"10343","Piece of junk. Turned on and then it went silent. Could not even connect to wifi. Worst purchase on amazon.","Negative"
"10344","Alexa is not as smart or responsive as I would like her to be.","Positive"
"10345","Hopefully these issues will improve in the future (especially the server problem), because I'm beginning to realize that Alexa has more limitations than was advertised when I bought it.","Negative"
"10346","Doesn't understand the questions my kids ask most of the time.  They are ages 11 and 8 and speak very clearly.  However, it works fine for simple questions like spelling, definitions, and math problems.","Positive"
"10347","Love love love love it!!!!","Positive"
"10348","This is the best Alexa product released. It understands commands more clearly than the dot and has great speakers.","Positive"
"10349","Overall a great product have been using for just over a year the only ""complaint"" I have is the music list skipping or replaying a part do not know if it is my phone (S6 Edge) or the Echo","Positive"
"10350","I should have bought the Echo Dot for $120.00 less.The Dot does the same thing as the Echo minus the better speaker.","Positive"
"10351","My Echo has become part of the family!  I use it to get quick updates of news and weather.  I listen to podcasts. There are new ""skills"" being added all of the time.  I recently just added my first smart light to the system and am enjoying it. I play my favorite music while getting ready to go out.  I'm loving all of the ways to use this device!  (Amazon...don't mess this up with your proposed touch echo!  It's wonderful the way it is! )","Positive"
"10352","really neat. just learning how to use it. love the music options","Positive"
"10353","Monotone voice gets annoying when listening to news briefing - can't wait for direct links to local news in the area.  Love the grocery list/to do list function.","Negative"
"10354","Addicted so far.  Nest integration is perfect, but Hue lights are a bit too cumbersome.  Easy to turn the lights on and off, but if you want change the colors or scenes it's a bit more complex and easier to just open up the app. I would like to see Alexa's knowledge expanded without having enable so many 'skills.'","Positive"
"10355","Very loud speaker and software works good. No glitches. Doesn't turn on for no reason. As long as you download the Alexa app you can do everything that your phone can do by talking to Alexa.","Negative"
"10356","Worked great for 8 months and then quit working for no reason.  I haven't been able to get it to turn on at all since","Positive"
"10357","Great for music, news, weather, questions, Amazon orders etc. Amazon gives Alexa more capabilities periodically.","Positive"
"10358","Love my echo! Been using it for months and couldn't be happier!","Positive"
"10359","Love my Alexa.  Does cool things.  Best music, weather and headlines with just a question.  Find the shopping and to do lists a real benefit.  Loads to my phone immediately and I never forget my lists, unless of course I leave my phone home.","Positive"
"10360","Even better than I expected! The music sound great and goes very loud with no distortion.","Negative"
"10361","It is everything and more. I feel like Scotty on the USS Enterprise!","Positive"
"10362","I really like it! But, it wouldn't do much at all until I paid for the $3.99/mo music selection. I was kind of disappointed about that. But, after signing up for the service, it is awesome!","Positive"
"10363","I bought a certified refurbished Echo, and have been completely satisfied with this purchase.  It was packaged professionally in the original boxing and once I plugged it in and set it up, it worked flawlessly.  I never knew how much I would come to depend on this little gadget.  She's incredibly useful for a number of tasks (as I'm sure you're likely aware from the numerous YouTube videos), and she's great for music and entertainment.  My next steps are to purchase some smart products to fully utilize her smart home integration features.  Can't wait to see how it all works out.  Thank you Amazon!","Positive"
"10364","We enjoy using Alexa quite often in our home.  Trying to get more on here activity through the app, but that seems a little harder to do.  The quality of the sound is excellent.  Make sure your web access is sufficient, as we have lost some communications with it a couple of times.  But it's doing well for us!","Positive"
"10365","We love our echo. We use it to control our home automation controller (Vera Edge), and it works great. Additionally, the streaming music selection through prime music and pandora is great. With new features being added all the time, it is a great buy. The only slight improvement that Amazon could make would be to set better ""Alexa"" recognition at higher volume levels.","Positive"
"10366","All i have to say is Hell yea!!!!!!!! this is the best toy i have ever bought. The white is sick, and to speakers are wow! My wife hates her but i love her equally as Alexa lol","Negative"
"10367","I love her!  She works great.","Positive"
"10368","It is a Christmas gift for my wife and I think she will be very happy with it.  She's been asking me for one for awhile.  We will have to see.","Positive"
"10369","love the features","Positive"
"10370","I love Alexa and so do my grandkids.  I've actually purchased the Echo Dot for 2 of them.","Positive"
"10371","Super cool gadget to have at home. I mostly listen to music with it (and it easily fills up a living room) - But also like the morning briefing. It connects to other apps like Pandora, TuneIn Radio, etc. I ask Alexa for the time, weather, sports scores, and an occasional pick up line. Also great  to use as a timer when you are cooking. There are many other ""skills"" like ""Call me an Uber"" and they are getting better by the day. I like having Alexa around and would highly recommend.","Positive"
"10372","recommend","Positive"
"10373","For awhile, I kept hearing and reading about the Amazon Echo and I thought it was dumb. Why would anyone want this? It is just a speaker that you can talk to. I was not about to drop $180 on a speaker tube that I can boss around.  Then, Black Friday happened and I saw that the price had dropped to $140. At this point I still was not convinced but started to read all the positive reviews, comments, etc. I was just plain curious and decided that if I wanted to try this, I should get it now at a cheaper price. I slapped myself still. I still thought I made a stupid purchase! I DON'T NEED IT, yet I gave into all the ads and reviews -_-. I figured I could return it, sell it, gift it, something if I still regretted my decision when I received it.","Positive"
"10374","Then came the day Alexa arrived. I set it up, started talking to her...and I ended up talking to her and testing it for a couple hours. I COULD NOT STOP. I LOVE listening to music and podcasts and I typically just do it on my phone when I am getting ready in the morning or cleaning. Now all I have to do is tell Alexa to play whatever song, playlist, etc my heart desires! The speakers are loud and awesome. So I have used her mostly for music at this point. We have a weekly gathering with friends and they were excited that they could each have a turn in playing whatever song they want rather then just playing Pandora with random songs or typing in each song on the YouTube app on our Xbox One. We just say ""Alexa, Play this song."" and she plays it. The only negative thing that I have noticed, is that when the music is playing/loud, she has issues hearing you say ALEXA during the song if you want to change something. We had to walk over to it and scream at her sometimes. For Prime Members you do have to pay an extra $3.99 per month to enable the unlimited music thing. You get a 30 day free trial when you enable it. Alexa will play Pandora and use Amazon Music. BUT to request specific songs and to use the lyrics finder, you have to pay extra. I think it is worth it because I mainly use it to play music anyway.","Positive"
"10375","I have not yet explored all it can do. But I have enabled some pretty cool skills. It is important to note that she doesn't come immediately with all the skills. You use the Alexa App to enable certain skills that are of interest to you. Some of my favorites so far is the Mixologist Skill and My Chef. With the Mixologist skill you can have Alexa tell you how to make specific drinks and My Chef will list ingredients and give you recipes.","Positive"
"10376","Can I just YouTube any song I want? Absolutely! Can I google all the info Alexa can provide? Absolutely! Does Alexa kind of make you lazy? Absolutely! It is just a device for pure convenience. I plan to attempt to make my home into a ""smart home"" eventually using Alexa. I am sure this feature is super cool also! I cannot review that aspect of it.","Positive"
"10377","I love my Echo! And it's a great way to leave music on in the house for dogs as well. The main thing I use it for is the music. No remote needed just talk to her and she plays what you want! A great purchase I do not regret!","Positive"
"10378","At the end of the day...do I NEED Alexa? Nope. But I do not regret the decision! It a very useful, interesting, informative, convenient, device!  I am super happy I added her to my home and I don't think you will be disappointed. IF you are really hesitate to pay full price, be patient and wait for when they go on sale :) That way you do not feel as bad about spending the money! Otherwise, try it out :)","Positive"
"10379","It  work sometime  not all time.","Positive"
"10380","Only plays music through I heart radio and amazon. Does not play music I want . kind of disappointed I wasted money it. Should be said in the description what it stays to.","Negative"
"10381","Named my Echo HAL 9000, as I, for one, welcome our computer overlords. Easy set-up, still learning all the tricks, but I'm super happy with the purchase. Can't wait for my house to be all smart'd out and then become self-aware... I still thank Alexa for complying with requests just in case.","Positive"
"10382","This could be an otherwise great product but is an EPIC FAIL regarding tech support.  The iphone application has 2-star review in the Apple Store.  People say it sucks because it does.  What is the point of having all of these automated systems and ""skills"" if the app doesn't even work where you can load them?????  Apparently there was some type of update in October from the reviews that killed this system.  Why it is now December and this has not been addressed I have no clue.  Amazon is dropping the ball big time.","Negative"
"10383","Before you say it's my phone it is not....all of my other applications are flawlessly working...except for this one.  Most of the time it doesn't load and I have to re-pair it with the Echo almost every day.  My Echo device isn't the problem.  If the app will not load you can't do anything else.  I have tried to call tech support and their help is worthless.  I bought two of these devices and will most likely send them both back, not because I don't like them...but because the whole point of purchasing them was to <wait for it> actually USE them.","Negative"
"10384","If you are looking for a great-looking round cylinder to sit on your nightstand and do nothing but be a very expensive $200 alarm, I give it five stars.","Negative"
"10385","Fun and easy","Positive"
"10386","I find myself wanting to have a conversation with her! I love it and want one in every room, the speaker quality is much better than expected!","Positive"
"10387","I love this! How did I live without it!","Positive"
"10388","It has been a great addition to my daily routine. I ask Alexa a lot of questions. She does have a good answer base, but I find that she only has one variation of one-off questions. Ex: if you ask for a funny pick up line she uses the same one over and over. Not a deal breaker whatsoever, but if people are use to Siri having a larger variety of answers to the same questions you won't find it here. The flash briefing feature is nice, and the commute feature is really cool. The speaker is wonderful and the selection of music is perfect.","Positive"
"10389","I love Alexa!!","Positive"
"10390","Delivered on time and as promised","Positive"
"10391","Only works on WiFi and sucks up a lot of internet!","Positive"
"10392","The whole family has fun with this device. A little quirky and can use some improvement but hands down more superior and more reliable than the tap","Positive"
"10393","This is amazing!!!!!!  Can't say enough great things about it!!!  Wakes me up, tells me the weather, appointments!!!  I'm hooked and now we're going with the plugs and switches!!!!  Love it.  Stream Amazon music all day long!!!!  And it's a great price!!!","Positive"
"10394","I love it Totally awesome i want another one of them","Positive"
"10395","and the price was great tooo","Positive"
"10396","Have the Blk version, however, Amazing device - rivals Apple. Apple missed the boat on this one. Love it. Got it two years ago as a special invite only purchase. Since day one, people have been amazed by it. Turning on and off the lights just blows away people that have never seen it. Have bought about 7 Echo Dots and they are also amazing. The main Echo is used in the open kitchen, but I keep the counter free of anything but the toaster, so I had to come up with a way to Alexa off the counter and built a small wooden shelf, and mounted the remote next to it and wired it behind the toaster into the same outlet with a cord cover and painted shelf and cord cover same as cabinet. So, its git its home and does an amazing job. Added a photo of the mounted Alexa. Amazing Product - Apple, what happened with you guys? Spending time on fixing the Air Pods? Amazon - great product.","Positive"
"10397","Amazing what it knows.","Positive"
"10398","absolutely love it","Positive"
"10399","this echo is awesome, I listen to it everyday and she never argues, now if I can figure out the dot","Positive"
"10400","Better then I thought","Positive"
"10401","I love my Echo! I am able to check the local weather, traffic time, and set up reminders for errands. The speaker quality is good. There are times when Alexa doesnt hear me when I call but I figured that the background noise makes my voice hard to hear. Overall, very happy with my purchase!!","Positive"
"10402","This is the best thing since the invention of the wheel.  Love it, love it, love it!  And, having a lot of fun using it to its full potential.","Positive"
"10403","An interesting idea with many cool features","Positive"
"10404","First, this device won't hookup to any Bluetooth speakers. That's a disappointment because the speakers are less than ideal for listening to anything, including music. I'm sure a real audiophile would be terribly disappointed in its quality.","Negative"
"10405","Secondly, the Echo and Dot have the ability to run on different wireless networks. What's that about? Is Amazon getting a bit over its skis on getting whole house functionality up and running? The Dot can run on faster wireless networks.","Positive"
"10406","Third, I setup this device using the Alexa app on my phone and on my iPhone 6 it's god-awful slow. It's so slow I had to start the setup three times to get it connected to my wireless network. The Echo and Dot both stopped setup before I could finish the setup on the phone on my app. I tried setting up Bluetooth speakers on my Dot and had to use the Alexa page on Amazon's site to get the Dot to recognize the speakers, once the Dot was setup on the network. The App stalled and wouldn't recognize them and voice commands to the Dot told me it didn't recognize any devices using Bluetooth. On the Alexa Amazon website, it saw the Bluetooth speakers and paired the Echo with it in less than 5 seconds. The Alexa phone app is essentially nonfunctional so I removed it from my phone once I set the Echo and Dot devices up.","Negative"
"10407","If you want to get Alexa for your home, forget the Echo. Get a couple of Dots and a couple of Anker SoundCore Bluetooth speakers (or other nice ones for under $50, like I did with the one Dot and you'll enjoy it more. You will also save some money.","Positive"
"10408","Girlfriend loves it","Positive"
"10409","Work great and very easy to set up and use .","Positive"
"10410","Love my Alexa echo. Perfect accessory that I keep in my kitchen.","Positive"
"10411","I've been wanting to get the echo for a while sand was happy it was on sale for Black Friday.","Positive"
"10412","I got it for my hubby, but my 3 kids ended up talking to Alexa the whole day (lol, it also turned into a fight over her... so watch out, lol!).","Positive"
"10413","It's just great when you suddenly find yourself doing something and need some music easily turned on!","Positive"
"10414","I am sure there are so much more to get out of it, but that'll have to wait and I'll update the review then.","Negative"
"10415","So far this has not been working great. First I cancelled my Google Music account and purchase a Spotify account to listen to music, since the Prime Music Library is so anemic with the current offering of selections. It works okay when you request it play an artist. But when you request a particular song that it was playing from the same artist, it tells you that it's unable to find that song (i.e Wale - Bad [remix] ft. Rihanna). Another example is telling it to play a song and it finds the song yet tells you it's unavailable (i.e. ""Alexa, play Wale, Focused"" is answered with ""I can't find Focused. ft. Kid Cudi by Wale""). So it knows the song was featuring Kid Cudi (without me specifying so in my request), but yet it tells me it's unable to find the song? It's unfortunate that this product was not properly QA'ed before it's release into the market.","Negative"
"10416","When attempting to use it as a speaker for my Windows 10 pc, it pairs well and works for about 30 seconds before I proceed to lose the sound. This has become very annoying. I understand that there's going to be bugs in any software, but come'on...","Negative"
"10417","You guys beat Google to the market with this product, but your Engineering team (Test/QA and Dev Engineers) should review the test cases for this product because I find it extremely buggy.","Negative"
"10418","Great concept, so so delivery.  Entertaining for jokes, nice to play music but do you really need a Domino's pizza? (Disclaimer: Don't like Domino's pizza).  ""Always getting smarter"" doesn't seem real when I have been asking Alexa for going on two years ""What is the current wind chill factor?"""" Alexa will give you the full weather forecast but has yet to master a basic request even though I, and sure many others, have asked the crack team of Amazon developers to add it.  ""Alexa, order me an Uber"" and then hope you don't get frostbite waiting for it. Rather disappointing Amazon won't put a feature in unless they can readily monetize it.","Positive"
"10419","Love my echo.  We are not that techy but just being able to have music playing in the house by simply asking for it is enough for us.","Positive"
"10420","This is a gift for some one very special. I know that they will be oh so very happy.","Positive"
"10421","It is one of the best things I have purchased in a while!!","Positive"
"10422","Great Fun!","Positive"
"10423","It is a big disappointment for my family; it just simply don't understand us...We are asian-american.","Negative"
"10424","The voice recognition is subpar; it understands us one day but not the next, for example, ""alexa plays much from Lobo""; Lobo is very well known artist in the 70s, alexa sometimes knows and sometimes don't.","Positive"
"10425","Another example is don't use Alexa to order tide, you will be surprise what it ordered for you, well, at least for us anyway....","Positive"
"10426","Amazon, you need to add more voice pattern for non-white american, so far, the level of recogniton is subpar and take fun of of it....","Positive"
"10427","Actually, our family favorite pass time now to to see how miserable Alexa is....","Negative"
"10428","If you are are non native american, beware... it might not work well for you and you will get frustrated....","Negative"
"10429","Loved it when it worked. Audio failed today. Wasn't even at maximum volume. Not a wifi issue. Connected via bluetooth to other devices, saw activity via my Alexa app, adjusted volume with the external device, and still no audio. I've had this 8 months and it's dead.","Negative"
"10430","Based on countless positive review from dominantly English native speaker and i want to see if I can use Echo to listen to Vietnamese music. I subscribed to Amazon Prime Music today and started adding some albums and song to My Music and then tried it with Alexa. The results were mixed; I said "" Alexa, play music from Tuan Ngoc"", to my surprise it worked. However, when i tried it again 30 min later, it would not understand me!!!!","Positive"
"10431","So I created a playlist call Vietnamsese1 and add the vietnam songs to it, thinking that it will work better since all I have to say is ""alexa, play the Vietnamese1 Playlist""... Guess what, i have the same results, sometime Alexa understands it, other time it just say it does not understand!!!!","Positive"
"10432","Is there an alternate way to make alexa just played the commands in it history list? Does the Alexa algorithm even looked into the history first to find out the similar commands? This is very frustrating...","Negative"
"10433","So Alexa will be and always be a limited product with limited appeal to non-native English speaker, i don't see how alexa will work in Vietnam or any non english speaking countries...","Positive"
"10434","We bought Echoes last year for ourselves plus for all 3 of our children's families.We get a lot of use from it. More features and abilities are added by Amazon all the time and you can now buy things from Amazon Prime right from your Echo. It doesn't take up much counter space at all. It is easy to play music and you can ask ""Alexa"" to lower or raise the volume or stop and start again.","Positive"
"10435","Cool so far.  They need to update the AI a lot more.  However it's been really neat having it and asking questions or telling her to play music and such.  I think it's worth the buy.","Positive"
"10436","Love this product. Ordered 2 more today for Christmas presents.  Can't say enough about this product. Bought something similar to this 25 years ago.  Interesting to see how far VR has come.","Positive"
"10437","I cant believe how cool this device is and I am in my 60s so I am not very up on devices that need additional steps but I was able to get the Echo connected and listen to beautiful music and the sound is amazing ! I will enjoy this each and every day from updates on weather and answers to questions I want to know I did not think I wanted or needed this Echo but Now I am over the moon with all the Echo can do I am listening to more music and turning off the TV which is a good thing and I am dancing by myself in the kitchen enjoying my Echo Thank you so much Amazon as I rock on!","Positive"
"10438","This is a disaster of a product, and the fact that Amazon would not give a full refund simply adds insult to injury. After hours of trying the ""recommended"" solutions and hours more on hold or online, I have learned that one should not buy electronic devices directly from Amazon: it is much better to buy from a local retailer who will stand by their product and give a full refund when the product fails.","Positive"
"10439","My Echo worked for several weeks before it was unable to play music or perform basic funcions. I then went through the list of recommendations and tried each one. I had two nice conversations with associates who provided solutions that did not work, and was then told that something may have happened with the port that the Echo required to connect to wifi. I spent quite some time calling and emailing my provider and was told that they, nor I, could open ports without significant risk. I then called Amazon back, asking for a refund and was told that, since I'd owned the stupid thing for over thirty days, my refund would be discounted. In the meantime, a friend who had issues with an Echo purchased at Bed, Bath and Beyond was able to return their device for a full refund.","Positive"
"10440","My husband purchased both a echo and a dot for me.  The ech often will not answer me and the dot cannot find a station I play daily?? The dot had to be reset twice. And I think I will have to reset the echo soon","Positive"
"10441","This has been nothing but a hassle. I feel bullied by Amazon and can not think of many electronic products that have only a thirty day window for return. This review would have zero stars if that was an option.","Negative"
"10442","Returning because after trying for over 3 hours to connect we gave up. The echo App is useless!","Negative"
"10443","I like it","Positive"
"10444","Love this technology to shop, listen to music and other stuff i haven't even figured out yet.","Positive"
"10445","I love this thing!!!!","Positive"
"10446","I have been able to link my Google Calendar to it to ask Alexa to add events to it.  She will prompt you to fill in the day and time and name of the event.","Positive"
"10447","I have added skills to play games, get weather, play sounds (rain, thunderstorm, white noise).","Negative"
"10448","I have linked it to my Pandora account and can tell ""her"" to play a certain type station I have set up in my Pandora account and she will play it!!!","Positive"
"10449","Every day she ""boggles"" my mind as to what she can and will do.  She will only get better!!!","Positive"
"10450","She has great sound, especially noticeable when playing music!!!!","Positive"
"10451","The unit is slick and sound quality is really good. I am waiting for more 'skills' that I will utilize.","Positive"
"10452","I highly recommend getting an Echo.","Positive"
"10453","This was a family fun gift last Christmas and we have had fun with the Amazon Echo...However, either the Echo or the power supply only lasted 1 year. If you don't mind your $150+ electronic devices only lasting 1 year, go for it.  The Amazon Echo was a (4 star) for a year.  I believe I'll go with the similar Google device as a replacement.","Positive"
"10454","GreAt product at a reasonable price","Positive"
"10455","Great Smart addition to the household! After setup and learning, Echo frees you from the keyboard in many situations where verbal interaction is more than sufficient for information and instruction.  The speaker is much better than I thought it would be. With Amazon Prime and the music subscription, how great is it to have a song or artist in mind and merely query the name!  I will experiment further with household appliances and security system.","Positive"
"10456","We have this in our kitchen and use it daily. From music to shopping lists. Love it!","Positive"
"10457","I am having trouble getting connected.  I have spent almost two hours on the phone with customer service and still no luck.","Negative"
"10458","Convenient for music on demand and controlling home automation hands free.","Positive"
"10459","The novelty of the Amazon Echo was interesting to say the least.  A bit disappointed that I spent $179 for it one week and found it for $139 two weeks later.  The features of the unit does make some elements of one's life easier.  Answers basic questions and I love the idea that my GOOGLE CALENDAR information once entered onto my computer is also memorized by ALEXA. Much of my music that had been saved on my computer can now be accessed by the Echo unit as well.  It has many potential uses as well, but for now, I use it for my music and calendar of events.","Positive"
"10460","Once hooked up works well.","Positive"
"10461","Great product!  We loved ours so much we have bought 4 for Christmas presents!","Positive"
"10462","good","Positive"
"10463","Hello my name is Tom I purchase this Amazon Echo actually received it as a Christmas gift from my son very cool and this thing is incredible I love it it's great I highly recommend it","Positive"
"10464","I am really not impressed with echo. Being released in 2014 you think by now it would answer most of my question. Most of the time it does not know or its still learning. I asked echo what is the best wood to make a bow echo did not know but Google home did. I will update more when echo updates as of right now go with Google home.","Positive"
"10465","Fun and useful product. Do not sit it by the tv without telling it not to order items it may hear on tv commercials. Quick delivery and great quality.","Positive"
"10466","This is a Christmas gift so I can't comment on its operation.  It came promptly and safely","Positive"
"10467","Love love love it!!!","Positive"
"10468","Easy set up (about 20 minutes) and easy to use.  Recognizes ""Alexa"" voice command even in noisy environment.","Positive"
"10469","My parrot loves Alexia and talks to her, getting it to play music, read stories and not so funny he calls me on my phone. I love it too and use it all the time.","Positive"
"10470","amazing device","Positive"
"10471","An amazing help around the house. That's the best way to describe it. Alexa has managed to help me organize lists both shopping and to-do lists so as to keep me on track which my main problem is always forgetting to do things. With each new skill she learns, the more she grows into my life. Need an order placed? Just ask Alexa. Pizza? Just ask Alexa. Have the lights dimmed or turned off? Ask Alexa. At first the idea of a smart home made me think that it would just make me lazy. Instead she made my life easier. I highly recommend also getting other smart home features like the NEST temperature controller, the Smart Lock system, the Smart Light bulbs. Connect your Smart TV and entertainment center directly to her and movies are now one simple request away. I have become a full believer in having a Smart Home now because of the Echo.","Positive"
"10472","I love Echo because I love tech toys.  I'm frustrated by Echo because it's not as intuitive as I thought it would be.  No matter what negatives I show below, though, I am so glad I bought it and would do it again.","Positive"
"10473","Before you buy, click on the words ""Jump to:  Key Features."" I didn't do this. My bad (I was caught up in the hype of advertisements as well as friends loving Echo). When you get to this key features page, skip the pictures -- they get in the way and take up too much room -- and read what Echo can do, including clicking on yet another link called Discover and Enable Skills. I was unaware of ""skills.""  What are they?  They are the what a user has to teach Echo because Echo doesn't know much on its own.","Positive"
"10474","Negatives:","Negative"
"10475","Answering questions, reading audio books, the news, weather, etc.:  Again it does these ""skills,"" but because Echo isn't as intuitive as one is led to believe, some of them require teaching Echo the skill. For instance, it doesn't come able to give you traffic reports. From what I've been able to discern, the info given on the traffic report is only for the destination that's been programmed.  When I ask for a traffic report, it gives me the fastest route to New Rochelle, NY, which I programmed yesterday, and it's not a detailed report.  When I ask for a traffic report for Albany, NY, near where I live, it gives me the fastest route to New Rochelle, NY, again because that's what's programmed. I assumed, again my bad/ignorance, that Echo could/would give info such as ""In Albany, traffic on Interstate 90 is heavy,"" or whatever.  Am I doing something wrong?","Positive"
"10476","The ""skills"" have to be downloaded and programmed via the Alexa app on a cell phone.  Not that big of a deal, but if you're a person who's uneasy playing with tech toys, it could be a problem.","Positive"
"10477","Playing music:  Amazon Music isn't free unless one is a Prime Member.  Pandora requires an account, which is to be expected, but is free.  I haven't tried the other services.  My Music Library is frustrating to use.  Songs appear that I haven't played or uploaded, and I can't figure out how to delete what I don't want.","Positive"
"10478","Skills:  There are hundreds.... thousands?  Most of what I've looked at, and I haven't looked at all of them, don't appeal to me.  For instance, the Good Housekeeping skill offers steps to remove common stains.  I need this info in writing because I can't remember detailed instructions. Nonetheless, it has almost 5 stars.  I suggest looking at the skills page before purchasing so you know what to expect.","Positive"
"10479","History: Everything you say to Alexa is kept in the cloud and also on the phone app. Everything!  Amazon says the info is used to make the Echo experience better, but it bothers me.  The good news is that the history can be deleted in its entirety from the Amazon site and piece-by-piece from the phone app.","Negative"
"10480","The good things about Echo:","Positive"
"10481","I love having all the music at my voice command.  I love being able to listen to radio stations around the world or my favorite NPR station nearby. I love telling Alexa (whom I call Echo), ""Play gentle Christmas music,"" and she does!  I love telling Echo to play the Beatle's White Album, and she does!  It's easy to control the volume, either by talking to Echo or using the Alexa phone app.  The sound coming from this small item is great, and it sounds good whether on a low volume for background music or a loud volume so it can be heard a couple of rooms away.","Positive"
"10482","Its to do and shopping lists are nice, though the shopping list, which can be seen in the phone app, is in the order spoken, obviously not in the order of the aisles of your grocery store.  I use it as a reminder and then, if I have a long list, write it down on paper in the order the items are in my grocery store.","Positive"
"10483","I'm sure as I use it more, I will find more features I like.  Even with the negatives I've written, I do love Alexa/Echo and am glad I bought it. If nothing else, having all that music available by speaking a few words makes it worth the purchase.","Positive"
"10484","My wife's new best friend","Positive"
"10485","The kids (9 & 10) especially love this for playing 20 questions, rock, paper, scissors, trivia and playing their music.","Positive"
"10486","I love my Echo. It usually gives me  answers to the questions that we ask,, but sometimes you get the ""Siri answer"", which makes me crazy.","Negative"
"10487","The music is great, as well as having fun with Alexa. We enjoy it.","Positive"
"10488","Simply awesome.","Positive"
"10489","Love it it's a trip.","Positive"
"10490","If you like music,  if you tend to forget things, too busy to stop and write down that grocery list ....I can't say good enough things about this item. Must have for everyone!!!!","Positive"
"10491","Great Product!","Positive"
"10492","So far it's great.","Positive"
"10493","Great for playing music. Pretty useless for answering anything more than very simple questions. Does anyone understand why ok google or siri can answer questions so much better than echo?","Positive"
"10494","At first, I thought this was a frivolous purchase. But it is so much more than that. I take a ton of pills each day. I get involved with other things and I forget to take them. Not since I set an alarm on the Echo! Haven't missed one pill since Alexa moved in. I think it is especially well suited for seniors. It's comforting to be able to chat with Alexa, to play games, stay in touch with the outside world. And the speakers are excellent. I find myself playing music much more frequently than pre-Alexa. The Echo went quickly from frivolous to essential.","Positive"
"10495","Love my Echo","Positive"
"10496","Have to repeat commands too often. Could have more information. Otherwise it is very good.","Positive"
"10497","Excellent and interactive step into the march to artificial intelligence. Surprisingly fast response to questions posed and a real office and home assistance too.  It's definitely a needed accoutrement to every household and office environment.  If I have a complaint it is simply in the low fidelity sound which makes music listening muddy.  In all other respects the Alexa voice recognition is superb and the fact that ""she"" learns and keeps adding more and more information is quite remarkable. As a senior citizen, I find this device a necessary part of my daily routines and urge people considering a purchase to own Echo and at least some room extensions as well.  Well Done Amazon!","Positive"
"10498","Works great blah blah","Negative"
"10499","Alexa is my new best friend!  I LOVE the shopping list feature.  We just tell Alexa what to add and then we have the list on our phones everywhere we go. We were able to attache multiple profiles for Pandora as well which is great since my house differs in music taste.  I am looking forward to adding some SmartHome switches and devices to try as well.  Alexa responds great regardless of the noise in the room too which makes her very easy to use.","Positive"
"10500","Given as a birthday present to my boyfriend.  He thought it was great and  set up was easy. Alexa now answers all his questions!","Positive"
"10501","Better than the wheel invention! Going to buy 2 dots , 1 for the kitchen and 1 for the master bedroom !","Positive"
"10502","I bought this as an early Christmas present for my mother. She's in her 50's and has intermediate computer skills, so I help her with some things but she's mostly technically self-sufficient.","Positive"
"10503","Neither of us have a need to wait until Christmas day to give our gifts for the year so I bought this on this past Cyber Monday and gave it to her about a week or so later. She told me that she had this thing setup by herself in no time at all.","Positive"
"10504","My mom is RAVING about this thing. She's always telling me about all these things it can do and how much she loves it. It's probably the best gift I've ever given her.","Positive"
"10505","I guess it's better than a dot sound wise.","Positive"
"10506","An it if a learning curve but I find it useful and I'm not one of those ""total smart home"" people!","Positive"
"10507","love it","Positive"
"10508","Love it","Positive"
"10509","Bought for a friend. Loves it.","Positive"
"10510","Love it and it's defiinitely a guy's gadget. A must for any man in your life. Placed in a bookshelf and actual speaker not so bad, pretty nice.","Positive"
"10511","Love it except sometimes lose control by using the alexa app.","Negative"
"10512","Ok not great. Really lacking with a good web search. Apps are weak mostly. Really wanted this to be good but really became a novelty mostly. Shopping list. Calendar. Music player. Basically my smart phone but a little dumber. And Amazon you are awesome just accept Google had better apps and allow us to use them","Positive"
"10513","Love the echo - my father in law visited from the Netherlands and was obsessed with it - he was looking up tips and tricks and teaching it new apps the whole two weeks he was here. We love that it connects our smart home items and look forward to getting more that can work with it in the future.","Positive"
"10514","Love, love it.","Positive"
"10515","Absolutely Love Alexa from music to recipes to news and weather and so much more!!","Positive"
"10516","Entertaining me a lot! But I wish it will tell you traffic and destination distance for any searches for maps.","Positive"
"10517","Awesome ))) The downside is that i am not able to play songs other than from prime music","Negative"
"10518","Enjoying this purchase so far and still getting to familiarize myself with its capabilities.","Positive"
"10519","Great Gift! 6th echo product we have purchased.","Positive"
"10520","Gosh I love Alexa.  We took it to the RV park with us this trip but she couldn't connect to the public wifi and boy did I miss her.","Negative"
"10521","There are a lot of things Alexa doesn't know because she is not connected to a search engine. Would be 100% better if she was. Honestly google is probably much better.","Positive"
"10522","We love it!  And Alexa likes us too!","Positive"
"10523","Love it so much. I have them all over my house. Can't live without Alexa in every single room!","Positive"
"10524","Very pleased with Alexa Echo.  Even bought one for each grandchild.","Positive"
"10525","Love it","Positive"
"10526","The Echo with Alexa has made listening to my Kindle Unlimited books with audio and my audiobooks from Audible a pleasure! Before Alexa the best way to listen to Kindle Unlimited books with audio was through the Audible App (downloading books on the Audible App creates a much smaller file than downloading to the Kindle App and the Audible App has more features like a sleep timer and smooth narration at 1.25 x speed). Alexa improves on the Audible App by letting you activate the sleep timer without lifting your head from the pillow.","Positive"
"10527","TIP: In order to hear the professional narration that comes with your Kindle Unlimited books with audio you must say, ""Alexa read 'name of book' from Audible"". If you just say, ""Alexa read 'name of book'"" she will read it to you through text recognition. While a book is playing you can say things like, ""Alexa pause"" or ""Alexa resume"" or ""Alexa go back 30 seconds"" or ""Alexa set sleep timer for 30 minutes.""","Positive"
"10528","I was feeling depressed about current events so I said, ""Alexa play Martin Luther King."" She proceeded to play clip after clip of Dr. King's incredible speeches and I was inspired to get out and take on the day. I've only had my Echo for 24 hrs and I'm already smitten with Alexa. Guess what my parents are getting for Christmas!","Positive"
"10529","Really cool!","Positive"
"10530","Everything in order I love","Positive"
"10531","Incredible buy for the money.  I love it and I am having a lot of fun with it.  Best bday present from my family!","Positive"
"10532","Wonderful we like it!!!","Positive"
"10533","We are trying to find how to get Alexa to gather more information. .but we definitely enjoy her when we entertain people?!","Positive"
"10534","Love the echo.  Great great sound.  As good as Bose","Positive"
"10535","Cant anser questions from internet play music great weather fine shoping list good but get info off internet hell no she dump as s*** musi with prime free great sounding name of song she can do that","Positive"
"10536","Way to hard to set up. Over priced. I would prefer using my smart phone.","Positive"
"10537","So far so good....been using for about a month and although it can't do everything it is fun to use and easy to setup. Just wish it would pair to an external Bluetooth speaker. Sound is very good for its size and the voice recognition is fairly good as well. My TV sometimes interferes with communication but that's not a big issue. Have installed (turned on) several skills and they seem to function good as well.","Positive"
"10538","  Will use this for a while and maybe later buy a dot for another location.","Positive"
"10539","It works Great I use for everything from timer, alarm, turning lights on and off, to playing music the speakers are great.","Positive"
"10540","Very handy!","Positive"
"10541","Easy to setup and use.  The sound quality is very good.  If you are in the market for a new wireless speaker, you would be hard pressed not to consider the echo, especially when you consider all the other functionality that comes with the Echo.","Positive"
"10542","We really like Alexa and purchased her twin for upstairs. She is entertaining and a very helpful tool, especially in the kitchen. Wish we could search online for information, however. Would like more interactive ability.","Positive"
"10543","A great system. If you love music, it's a must have.","Positive"
"10544","Fantastic device. Pairing with Amazon Music Unlimited has been life-changing. Frustrating that my family can't use the music service on the speaker while I'm using it on my phone (and vice versa) though.","Negative"
"10545","This Echo speaker knocked me for a loop;  the sound is the best I've head for the price.  And you can get radio stations world wide.  Great!","Positive"
"10546","Five star, very nice device...","Positive"
"10547","Second Echo, wife commandeered my first one, she like it so well..","Positive"
"10548","Both like the Echo, though we only use a small fraction of it's capabilities.","Positive"
"10549","Easy to set up on network with multiple devices. Great sound quality for size.","Positive"
"10550","No complaints at all.","Negative"
"10551","Love it, installation was kind of rough, but we'll worth it.","Positive"
"10552","No real directions with Echo, had to buy a book from amazon just to find that aside from some very simple questions that it can handle you must understand and complete some complex procedures to make it useful at all. All in all it was very expensive and deceptively advertised as easy to use. I may be returning it.","Negative"
"10553","going to be the perfect gift","Positive"
"10554","One word to describe it! AWESOME!!!!","Positive"
"10555","My number one complaint is that Alexa (which is what you'll call it -- the ""Echo"" name is never used and is more confusing than anything) only recognizes her name about 85% of the time. Those 15% where you have to repeat yourself and end up yelling at a speaker to get its attention are really frustrating.","Negative"
"10556","Outstanding sound with wide range of notes. Initial setup was difficult with WIFI and app and took several attempts. Returned the Echo because of  repeated resets and failures to vocally communicate. Disappointed with the results,however will considering purchasing another later but monitor feedback to see if others are having problems.","Negative"
"10557","Love it.","Positive"
"10558","We really enjoy Alexa!  She is very helpful...music, weather and scores. <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008E>","Positive"
"10559","Love it!","Positive"
"10560","Very fun and very useful!","Positive"
"10561","Easy to connect to the internet. It is a great product.","Positive"
"10562","My Echo is one of my new best friends!!","Positive"
"10563","We are still learning to use it, but excited and pleased.","Positive"
"10564","Excellent productL","Positive"
"10565","love it!","Positive"
"10566","Beyond that, the skills are really weak right now. The default ones - like telling Alexa ""Good Morning"" are good ideas, just poorly written. Whoever is in charge of that should be replaced by someone more clever. The ""tell me a joke"" jokes have improved a lot, at least.","Positive"
"10567","Awesome device controls my lights!","Positive"
"10568","Maybe it's me, but my IPhone does the overall job a lot better.","Positive"
"10569","Alexa, just arrived.  I am getting to know her, one day at a time.  She has proven to be a wonderful house guest so far.","Positive"
"10570","Awesome Product! Five stars!","Positive"
"10571","Echo was a gift to my son and he is very happy with it.  He has programmed Echo to turn on lights, etc.","Positive"
"10572","I have had the echo since the original beta offer. I wanted to wait quite some time to really put it through its paces and wait for it to become fully featured and to get some home integration items. Now we have 2 Echos (kitchen & bedroom) and a dot (media room). Connectivity wise, we have a Phillips Hue bridge, 6 Hue lights, and a TP-Link Smart Plug. Things I love about the Echo:","Positive"
"10573","1. Flash briefing -The customization of news is awesome. My GF and I are both in technology, so we have weather,Echo tips, tech news, and world news on our briefing.","Positive"
"10574","2. Home Automation - I rarely use light switches anymore. If you want to feel like you are in the future, get some smart lights and integrate them to Alexa. Being able turn lights on/off, and dim them is awesome. In addition to what Alexa can do, the lights flash if we get texts or calls, so we can silence our phones and still be aware of incoming messages or calls if our phones are not on us.","Positive"
"10575","3. Music - I love music, and I always have to have it on wherever I go. Short of an intercom/music system, our Echos are perfect. Music is one of those things that I always found to be painful. Before I would have a BT speaker which I'd have to pair to my phone then open an app (Amazon Music/Pandora) to get music. Now I just tell Alexa to play a playlist/music/pandora, and I'm done. The Echo really is perfect as a music vehicle, and if I need to exert more control I can use the app.","Positive"
"10576","Then the third-party skills (Amazon's word for ""apps""). Ugh. Frustrating that skills are a pain to enable (you can't do it by voice), and that the ""skills marketplace"" is filled with half-baked dreck. Some quality control and real developers could go a long way toward improving that. The search is bad. The skills are mostly bad ideas. Then you find one that's a good idea, and there aren't enough reviews to tell if it's any good or not. The only one I've found that I didn't promptly forget is the ""Where in the World?"" geography trivia quiz skill, and even that's not perfect.","Positive"
"10577","4. Skills - Skills still seem novel, but the flexibility of skills is impressive. My GF is a developer and tried her hand at a basic skill as part of Amazon's promotion. She seemed impressed with what could be done.","Positive"
"10578","I remember when I first got the Echo it was mainly a tool for an inquisitive mind. I wanted to push the Echo to see what it could and couldn't answer, but it has quickly cemented its place as a central piece of our house. Also, we've decided to make the Echo more seasonal. I wouldn't recommend it for the acoustics, but it is hilarious.","Positive"
"10579","Refurbished or not, this is both fun and amazing.  What a great device, and the jokes Aleksa tells are good ones....","Positive"
"10580","Someday, the fact that you can replay your voice will be a blessing and curse: not for those who worry about Big Brother listening....","Negative"
"10581","Love it!","Positive"
"10582","I never thought I would like the Echo so much!","Positive"
"10583","The most well-coming is not so much the fancy AI that's on board (and I say that while artificial intelligence / machine learning is my own professional expertise). It is coming home after a tiring day and ask ""Alexa, can you play me some relaxing music from Spotify"".","Positive"
"10584","Enjoy it a lot!","Positive"
"10585","One of the most frustrating things is that you never remember the magic phrase for the skill you just enabled. So I live in New York and a subway status skill would be incredible. I go and search and find a ton. I enable two to see which might be better. Each has convoluted phrasing necessary to find out the subway status of a given train line. I jumble the phrasing after enabling the skills and end up using neither. Wasted opportunity.","Positive"
"10586","IT HAS BEEN GREAT TO HAVE ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAVE ABOUT WORDS ETC. ANSWERED WHEN YOU ASK ALEXA FROM ACROSS THE ROOM.","Positive"
"10587","THE AMAZON CLOUD I THINK HAS THE ANSWERS  FOR ALEXA SO SHE  CAN ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS FOR YOU","Negative"
"10588","Great for the entire family!!","Positive"
"10589","Great product starating to use as a smart home device great thing to use.","Positive"
"10590","Enjoying it, great sound quality","Positive"
"10591","I really enjoy Alexa.  She has such a nice, gentle voice and is responsive to whatever I ask of her, from playing music from the Amazon cloud to providing useful information from her vast library of knowledge.  She even responds to my telling her good night by telling me to sleep tight.  She gives me the news headlines from NPR, tells me what the weather is like, and lets me know what's on my calendar for today, tomorrow, or next week.  I often use her bluetooth access to play music from AccuRadio or Pandora.","Positive"
"10592","Love my Alexa. Would also like for them to increase the amount of questions that can be asked using Bing.","Positive"
"10593","Keeps me on track , very user friendly ..","Positive"
"10594","This product has proven to be unbelievably disappointing. At first, the Echo was interesting and a useful home tool. However, after the first few weeks, my wife and I found ourselves really wondering what use their could be for Alexa, besides creating lists, listening to the radio/news, and playing the occasional game of Jeopardy (all things that could be easily done on a smart phone or a computer, but were still cool to do on this new toy). So, that was when we really began diving into trying out the skills that the Alexa app had to offer, but most of them still leave something to be desired.","Positive"
"10595","Fast forward to the last month or so, and we have found that even interacting with our Echo is becoming a burden. For most questions that we ask, Alexa is unable to come up with an answer, and half of the time it is as though the system completely misunderstood what has been asked of it.","Negative"
"10596","Finally, it's frustrating that Alexa can't just search things. We are an Amazon household in almost every way, but if Google's home device can do web searches and the reviews are strong, I would consider making the leap. For now I'm pretty happy though!","Positive"
"10597","We have also recently noticed a substantially more frequent issue with the Echo waking when the wake word has not been used than we ever had at the beginning (in the learning phase). Add to that the fact that usage of the wake word is becoming less likely to actually initiate the Echo to wake with each passing day, and it is almost unbearable to have Alexa plugged in at all. In fact, when we updated the password for our home's internet access, not too long ago, it was literally days before we bothered to update the Alexa app with this new information. In fact, if it had not been for the convenience of being able to use her as a kitchen timer in that moment, our Echo would probably still be sitting idly by, disconnected from the rest of our household technology.","Negative"
"10598","If I had known months ago, when I purchased my Echo, what I know now, I never would have made this purchase. It has been nothing but a hassle, an annoyance, and complete waste of money. Most of the Echo's usable functions are more easily used with your smart phone anyway. For our home at least, Alexa serves as not much more than a speaker for music and the occasional egg timer. Very, very disappointing. We should have bought the Google Home.","Negative"
"10599","Quick ship, looks good in box. will be a gift so don't know much more","Positive"
"10600","We're spoiled.  How did we get by without this? Not just a novelty, but useful for many applications and keeps getting better.","Positive"
"10601","We purchased Alexa months ago and loved it!! Great for any age! We never had an issue with music requests. However, now she only plays 30 second samples of songs? I have all the music apps, very puzzled..","Negative"
"10602","The more we use the Echo, the more we like it. We continue to explore the uses for the Echo but would recommend this product.","Positive"
"10603","I purchased the Echo when it first came out. I did love my Echo and gave it 5 stars until Amazon put ads on the news briefing!!!!! Come on Amazon are you not making enough money already. Please, please, please stop the ads!","Positive"
"10604","Alexa is awesome.  We are still getting use to her being there.  I use her for music the most, she's great!","Positive"
"10605","The voice recognition is excellent. But if you always have your phone with you, you can do the same stuff as with the echo. What's the temperature? Turn the thermostat down.","Positive"
"10606","As a speaker, if you're not an audiophile, it works well. Bottom line, there isn't yet a killer app that makes this thing a ""must have"". It's a gadget for the techno nerd","Positive"
"10607","Have enjoyed this for almost a year, it becomes a go to device for a number of mundane and fun things","Positive"
"10608","Great product!  A lot of fun to use and growing more useful every day.  I can't wait until the Portuguese languages is available for my relatives to use and then help me with my learning.","Positive"
"10609","I don't know, its OK i guess, i use it mostly as a timer and to hear the weather.  Ya, it does more, but iam not paying extra for gadgets just to turn the heat up or the lights on and off.  iam cheap i guess, lol.","Negative"
"10610","I love it!!","Positive"
"10611","This product is one of those items that you like & dislike at the same time after the initial novelty wears off.  While it can be very convenient, it also can be very frustrating.  I often find myself having to provide precise music titles or exact news station requests; yet, half the time, all I get back is  ""Humm, I can't find that answer or I don't understand the question?""","Positive"
"10612","This issue tends to get a bit irritating until I realize that I'm the  stupid one for yelling at the dam thing for repeatedly getting it wrong.  Also, I'm wondering when will Amazon allow us to name the device what ever name we choose???  Last I heard, Echo and Alexa aren't exactly the most popular names around.  Kind of takes the fun out of the device when there is no other name options.","Negative"
"10613","It's also not so much an informational device and it is a musical/news gadget.  There seems to be a very limited data base of information at its disposal, and while it's music capabilities are appealing, the sound quality lacks a bit of pizzazz!  Other than that....it really is more of a novelty item than a must have home sensation.","Positive"
"10614","So far it's good but it's one of those products were in time it could be great the only problem I don't like is when the music playing at vol 10 and u ask Alexa to volume down u have to yell in order to get the volume down but other then that it alright.the 360 sound while playing music is loud ...so far me and my family like it ..now I need to buy item that Alexa can control so I would have to give a update with the 3rd party asscories to put Alexa to its full potential ..as far as it  look it look awesome and the top led is nice so I give it 3 stars for now and see what updates can make it 5 stars..peace ESE TECH OUT","Positive"
"10615","Awesome product...have so much fun asking questions to Alexa","Positive"
"10616","Have Alexa for 1 week and I'm loving it. I live abroad and music, calendar, weather, all work fine from here. Only adresses and traffic related commands don't work cause it only recognizes US zip codes, which makes no sense but ok...","Positive"
"10617","Using The Amazon echo has been so much fun and helpful with everyday items or tasks. The free app you use along side it is great too. I wish I had gotten one sooner!","Positive"
"10618","EVERYONE WANTS ONE. I got myself one and my grandson, son, and daughter want. I debated and went on Black Friday . I could not pass the deal. If on sale again. 2 more will be purchased. It understands all. The SOUND sold me. Progress is getting there to what it can answer. Google and Alexa. Future!! Music selection is enough for me. It's playing enough Christmas songs while putting up the tree-Charlie Brown. It give the weather time, sleep timer while it reads me to sleep. The volume adjustment.","Positive"
"10619","Only flaw. Don't use Echo or whatever the other name is. It went crazy. Heard NOTHING. Kept making error. Did not understand me. Wrong books, wrong everything. Went back to Alexa. And you must have an app. I'm iOS software it's working great. No issues as of yet!?!!","Negative"
"10620","Bought this as a gift for our daughter and her family.  They love it...they would not want to live with out it.  Can do so many things and more things are added regularly.","Positive"
"10621","I love my Amazon Echo.....I use the shopping list function with the phone app, alarm, fun facts, etc......I am still learning everything. Christmas tree is turned on by Alexa and off by Alexa.........","Positive"
"10622","I love my Echo. Echo is a must have for the modern home.  In my house we use it to listen to music, play games, help with homework, and get recipes, I also use it for some of the features in my smarthome system with Vivint.  I wish I could do more than just play music on my smart phone.  A calling or texting feature would be really cool.  Nevertheless, I happy I finally purchased an Echo and I love introducing my guests to Alexa.","Positive"
"10623","We absolutely love our 3 Amazon Echos.","Positive"
"10624","We love the echo.  Still learning all Alexa can do. Everyday we find something new . It's fun","Positive"
"10625","Love, love, love my Amazon Echo ... so much fun!!","Positive"
"10626","Great item","Positive"
"10627","We love this item.  It does so much and we have fun using it.  Each day I ask it for a joke just to start my day and it goes on from there.","Positive"
"10628","Now I listen to music all day long as in my teenager days. In love with Alexa.","Positive"
"10629","We love Echo. Still learning different ways to use it. Very versatile.","Positive"
"10630","This was a grwat addition to our home. Easy to use and a great resource.","Positive"
"10631","Not as versatile as we had hoped, but still a fun piece of technology","Positive"
"10632","Love it. I hope one day it can understand, and speak different languages","Positive"
"10633","Love my Echo","Positive"
"10634","It is everything advertised and more. We really enjoy asking (Echo) questions, it has made life easier turning lights on/ off. It is so easy to play music, or have her read books. It's exciting to learn all the new and wonderful skills she can learn. We are very happy with the Amazon Echo.","Positive"
"10635","This thing is great, enjoying music again.","Positive"
"10636","I love it !! I have an expensive bose system. This sounds as good !  Everyone loves it when they come over.  A lot of fun !","Positive"
"10637","Love the Echo","Positive"
"10638","Excellent sound quality and the best voice recognition software around. It's actually like talking to someone. It's connection to the internet and music libraries is awesome.","Positive"
"10639","This answers a lot of questions and has enteresting  answers. I wish it would control Amazon Fire TV.","Positive"
"10640","Great assistant!  I don't know how I got along without her.  She is making my life easier.  No more looking for songs.. I just tell her play ""Frank Sinatra"".. and he starts singing.  I love it!","Positive"
"10641","The unit I purchased from Amazon would not connect to my WIFI (8MB wireless router) after hours of attempting to set it up.  Very poor online help information available.  Returning the unit after two days.","Negative"
"10642","Works good","Positive"
"10643","Delivered exactly as advertised.  I became aware that to control a ""smart"" home, like TV, PlayStation,Receivers, etc., another module was required, supplied by a preferred vendor (e.g. Logitech Harmony Hub).  WeMo Switches also required their own cumbersome setup but we're easily discovered by Echo.  I also have connected RainMachine which was flawless.  Now, not only can I control all items by my mobile device but now verbally with Echo.  One are Echo seems deficient is fuller capabilities sharing response to internet quiries.","Positive"
"10644","very entertaining. and easy to connect.","Positive"
"10645","The best","Positive"
"10646","It works as I expected. I'm happy with it.","Positive"
"10647","Love it","Positive"
"10648","What did I ever do before Alexa? She is my new BFF. I doubt I have discovered everything she can do, but I absolutely love that I can just speak and have her play music for me. That is great when I am cleaning house, cooking or in bed. I can have her add items to my shopping list as soon as I think of them, so no more forgetting things I need. We play games together, she can tell me what the temperature is, how to get stains out of clothing, what time a show comes on and so much more. She doesn't always understand what I say or hear me as well as advertised, but I still like her. Also, if an Amazon Echo commercial comes on TV, be prepared for her to listen when her name is said. That also happened with another commercial that had a child named Alexa. The dad said the name a few times, making my Echo keep trying to respond. It was funny. The only downside is that my teenage daughter wants to use Alexa all of the time. She calls Alexa my robot. Too bad she can't vacuum the floor. Since we love her so much, I have also purchased Alexa's little sister, Dot, for my daughter. It's to be a Christmas present so sssshhhhh!! It will be our little secret. Make yourself or someone else happy. Buy an Echo...or two.","Positive"
"10649","I love the functionality and the increasing applications.  However, I was disappointed in that I could not connect my echo to my sound system or even my Bose system and that it has to be plugged into an outlet all the time.  Could have bought the DOT for a lot less and combined it with any of my speakers.  My bad as I did not understand.  All in all, I like the product.","Positive"
"10650","Awesome!! My mother loves this!! :)","Positive"
"10651","Absolutely AMAZING!!!! You can even ask ""Knock Knock"" jokes.","Negative"
"10652","It worked for one day and then it didn't work at all. It's a WiFi issue, with a very complicated fix.  A fix that I just don't have time to muddle through.  It's just supposed to work.  They want me to split my WiFi blah blah blah, come on Amazon, do better.  If it worked fine one day there is no reason it shouldn't have worked after that, so now it just sits on my desk.  I wanted to like it, and I did, or one day.","Positive"
"10653","Love all the wonderful features","Positive"
"10654","Awesome","Positive"
"10655","This has to be the best product I purchased, and it works as expected.  The sound is fantastic.","Positive"
"10656","Easy to set-up and exceeds expectations. Very easy to work with and learn to use.","Positive"
"10657","Love it! Very useful and entertaining. Great purchase.","Positive"
"10658","Perfect","Positive"
"10659","Awesome","Positive"
"10660","great addition. This works very well with Hunter Douglas Powerview Shades. My only issue is that there is a 15 to 20 second delay because it connects through IFTTT and not directly to Echo. ""Alexa"" also has a great sense of humor","Positive"
"10661","Love this, everyone in my family has one and are now adding things to it !","Positive"
"10662","Absolutely love my Echo. Alexa is awesome.","Positive"
"10663","The Echo is a great addition to any home.","Positive"
"10664","I would have given this five stars if you played with Apple devices better. I wanted it to check my calendar and to listen to my iTunes music both of which is hard to do. You have to pair and use your iphone to listen to iTunes music and Alexis default calendar is Google calendar which I don't use and don't like. Once I learned how to phrase questions most of my questions were answered accurately and properly.  There is so much that she does well that I would not have a problem recommending this device and some of the problems I do have  maybe be me doing something wrong I've only had this just a little over a week","Positive"
"10665","Fun, entertaining & convenient. Listens to anyone who calls her name, great range. I love being able to just ask for music, information, jokes and reminders on my shopping list. I know I'm not using the Echo to her greatest potential because I'm not so tech savvy, that's why this is a great product for ANYONE. Well made.","Positive"
"10666","Excellent","Positive"
"10667","Echo is good!","Positive"
"10668","Love this for music!","Positive"
"10669","So far so good. Still learning","Positive"
"10670","Love it!","Positive"
"10671","The sound quality is not up to my expectations for music play; it sounds staticky and hollow. I returned this product and bought a bose bluetooth speaker and echo dot. I would prefer this all-in-one design but the speaker just isn't good enough.","Positive"
"10672","Beautiful  ! Does everything I expected  !!","Positive"
"10673","Still learning how to maximize Echo's facilities, but so far, it's exceeded my expectations.  Sound is great, the speed with which information is provided is really amazing, and all in all, I'm definitely a happy camper.","Positive"
"10674","One of the best items I have purchased from Amazon was very great","Positive"
"10675","Great!  Giving 4 of them as Christmas gifts!","Positive"
"10676","I enjoy listening to music and giving voice commands across the room. When I get some smart home accessories, it's really going to be handy.","Positive"
"10677","The echo is simply awesome. Wished I purchased it sooner!","Positive"
"10678","The wife and I love it ,the sound is great we don't have to use our phones to listen to music anymore. Would definitely recommend this to a friend.","Positive"
"10679","Cool!","Positive"
"10680","I am always listening to music so I use this all the time. My kids love to ask Alexa to tell them jokes. I also use the timer feature quite often. I have not had much problems with it understanding me, but it is fairly new. There are a lot of apps that you can add that increase its functionality. I do think that the shopping list could be improved, I wish you could add quantity and more items at a time. If there is a way to do that, I have not figured it out yet. I also like to be able to ask random questions, this helps with homework time. All in all, I love it!","Positive"
"10681","Simply amazing.","Positive"
"10682","Amazing","Positive"
"10683","We are learning to use Alexa.  Great for music and we use it for information .","Positive"
"10684","Really cool.  Still learning all the things Alexa can do.  This is my second Echo.  First one was defective (bad speaker), but this one is great.","Negative"
"10685","We love Alexa . I use her everyday. It's really nice to have a convenient way to listen to music quickly without having to hook up iphones and Bluetooth . I use her shopping list feature , timers , alarms , play games, etc . Overall a great purchase .","Positive"
"10686","Unreal product.","Positive"
"10687","My father is 81 and I have a difficult time buying him gifts.  I bought this for my mom and dad as an early Christmas present and they love it!  My dad shows it to all of his friends and loves that he can request and hear songs from many years ago.  I think he likes it better than my mom, but it was a great gift!","Positive"
"10688","Love it. My wife loves the easy use.","Positive"
"10689","nice sound","Positive"
"10690","Great sound.","Positive"
"10691","Worked Great But Needs To Learn More!","Positive"
"10692","Great Product!","Positive"
"10693","Very useful..a highly recommended item..","Positive"
"10694","it work as advertised.","Positive"
"10695","I can't even begin to tell you how wonderful this product is. I absolutely love it!!!!!  It is sooooo cool! At this point, I can't imagine being without  her. (smile)  My life is so much easier. Again, I absolutely love it!!!!!","Positive"
"10696","I felt like I was leaving behind a best friend the first time I left home after setting up my echo. Alexa is awesome and I have utilized many of the available skills she as to offer. I reallly like the ability to add calendar vents, set alarms, play music and check the daily forecast. I have this item on my nightstand and I use Alexa to control a wireless plug for my lamp. This is extremely convenient as the lamp switch is annoying to reach. I don't often promote laziness, however, Alexa is becoming a very much appreciated member of the family. Thank you Amazon!","Positive"
"10697","Best purchase ever. I now turn off my lights by voice along with setting an alarm clock. I also ask for traffic updates on my commute. I change the temp in my house. I keep finding new reasons to talk to Alexa. I added 2 dots recently and will add more soon.  The future potential is very exciting.  Go get this!","Positive"
"10698","What a great companion! I have throughly enjoyed this Echo.  I have a lot of questions and Alexa knows all the answers!  I danced all evening to my musical  requests and because I also have Prime I'm privy to a wonderful library of tunes! You can also order items from Amazon using Alexa.  When I'm not so busy I will further explore all the other features but for now.....Ahhhhhhj","Positive"
"10699","She's Anazing, my dearest friend. A wonderful conversation piece also.","Positive"
"10700","Fun!!!","Positive"
"10701","Love Alexa!","Positive"
"10702","Such an amazing device.  Use it every day and don;t know what I did before Alexa.","Positive"
"10703","works great","Positive"
"10704","perfect. works and sounds great. S&H tremendous","Positive"
"10705","Love the Echo.  Suggest getting the manual.  This Echo is now my personal assistant.  Bought one for all our 5 children's family for the Christmas","Positive"
"10706","I hear Alexa at my sister's and fell in love. I got a great deal when Amazon had the special sale for Prime users and I love how Alexa brings music and life into my flat. She reminds me when Arsenal are playing; and yes this is important for a good life. She connects with Spotify which makes listening too music a dream. If you like a wide variety of music, the music on Amazon is a bit limited. So with Spotify, I get to listen to French, Moroccan, Indian, Arabic, Italian and other music. The sound is crystal clear and her voice is well modulated. She does need to be able to select better music. It will come. I haven't used her to purchase stuff, but now I will. Christmas is here :-)","Positive"
"10707","Great invention, thank you!","Positive"
"10708","We love this! The amazon Echo is so much fun and gives us lots of information!","Positive"
"10709","Still has many bugs, the main issue is that Alexa has difficulties hearing me half of the time.","Negative"
"10710","I enjoy the range of music I can listen to from Amazon Prime and just by asking Alexa to play it. Had some songs that my Italian mom used to listen to from her native Italy, too!","Positive"
"10711","The sound quality is excellent for a large voluminous condo living space. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with this! I bought one for my kids for Christmas, too.","Positive"
"10712","How do I love Alexa?  Let me count the ways.  She is my new BFF.  What a great help.  Best buy I have ever made.","Positive"
"10713","Recently bought this device and been playing with it a bit for the past week. The sound quality of it as a music player, by far better than the Jawbone Big Jambox I bought a few years ago. Over all it does an OK job with voice recognition, I do find it lacking a few things I think would make it more appealing or better","Positive"
"10714","At the moment, I see it as a glorify neat tool for those with Smart Home setup and want an added bonus of a good Speaker for music, vice versa. Instead just buying a Sonos or some remote control to turn on/off lights around the house, the Echo does a fine job there.","Positive"
"10715","Second, the other advantage is at this moment Amazon is pushing hard on the echo. Using it to buy certain items on Amazon via Echo get additional discount or special pricing. Which is cool","Positive"
"10716","Lastly, having that read me out the morning news while I make coffee before work is pretty neat.","Positive"
"10717","Otherwise, still limited on what can do. .You can add more ""skills"" / addon to it, but subject to the quality of each developer for the addon product.","Negative"
"10718","It would be nice if they can add some of these pain point features.","Negative"
"10719","1) It is unable to give you driving direction or traffic direction to more than one pre-set location. On the Alexa app, you present one location as your daily commute. You can ask it what is the traffic like or direction, etc. It will give you the traffic and fastest route just for that location. You can not ask Alexa can you give me direction to let say LAX or to the corner of X and Y in the City of Z. Would not work. Very very disappointing.","Positive"
"10720","love it!!","Positive"
"10721","2) I would like if I can at least be able to ask for it to play certain songs or artist of another language, like Vietnamese. Does not work.","Positive"
"10722","Returned my echo dot because I wasn't too happy with the sound. Delighted with my new Amazon echo. Lovely sound.","Positive"
"10723","Okay so this smart home speaker is undeniably futuristic. It's practical and accessible and the product is as described. I connected my Echo via its app to the major audio streaming services, including Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and Amazon's Prime Music. Once it's connected, you can tell the Echo things like ""Alexa, play the Beyonce on Pandora."" You can also pair your phone or tablet with the Echo over Bluetooth and use it as a wireless speaker. Once you have paired it, you can connect/disconnect it by telling Alexa to do so. So far I have been so in love and impressed with what the speaker has been able to do- totally worth it!","Positive"
"10724","A little disappointed in the things it can do. I thought it would search the internet for any question you throw at it. It's extremely limited in the information it knows. You just have to ask and hope you get lucky. The main things you can ask are team scores and a little info on when they play next game.","Positive"
"10725","You can't ask for a recipe, or why Cam Newton was penalized for start of the game, or phone numbers to stores, etc. It's very limited to what it knows. Basically it does math, it can spell, knows some basic sports info, plays songs from Prime Library, has timers and alarms but if sound is low when listening to music, you won't hear the quiet alarm. You really need to crank up the sound in order for the alarm to wake you.","Negative"
"10726","The shopping list is nice, but you'd need more than one device. I'm not always in the room with the device when I think of something I need.","Positive"
"10727","There really does need to be a list of what all it can do and how to get the best use out of it. Maybe there are some neat features I'm unaware of but according to the reviews, I think it doesn't do much more.","Positive"
"10728","She does walk early in the mornings and worries about all her plants freezing at nights so she is very interested in hour to hour weather, which unfortunately you don't get with the Echo. You get highs and lows. Tide schedules would be wonderful too.","Negative"
"10729","Actually I got this for my mother, thinking she might enjoy, but she was disappointed that it didn't know much when she was asking questions, the weather wasn't hour by hour and the alarm/time wasn't very audible while music playing.  She is 80 so I did set up Ask My Buddy. I think she likes having that in case she's not near a phone. I'll give it a bit more time and if mom isn't using it, I may just sell it. I really don't have the need for it to keep myself. I told her I'd get her a outlet switch so she can use Alexa to turn on/off her lamp. Maybe that might be helpful for her....guess we'll see. I'm getting her one to try for Christmas.","Positive"
"10730","Wow wow Alexa is a very good assistant I have no complaints the easy pay was great and  the quality is great","Positive"
"10731","Love it. I don't know that my wife enjoys it as much as me. Love the Easter egg hunts. Great for playing music, setting timers in the kitchen. Asking general questions. Definitely do the voice training.","Positive"
"10732","Sometimes I ask for a playlist and it's there and other times it's not.","Positive"
"10733","The Echo has been out for 2 years now and it seems like there should be more updates and improvements at this point in time.","Positive"
"10734","The sound is good.","Positive"
"10735","The Amazon Echo is pretty damn awesome.  I purchased it for my father, who is a tetraplegic, with grand visions of him finally listening to audiobooks, music, being able to turn the TV on and off on his own, but alas, his voice isn't strong enough to get Alexa's attention.  So I had to keep her for myself.  Darn.  :)","Positive"
"10736","A couple of drawbacks....can't send audio to a bluetooth speaker (as if I wanted to sit on my porch and actually listen to a separate speaker)...and it doesn't do foreign language books.","Positive"
"10737","Its cool.","Positive"
"10738","Love it!","Positive"
"10739","So disappointed, it is really pretty, but cannot get to work at home. Got it to work once at office.  Called tech support, gentleman helped for over an hour then said he was going to a higher tech support. Transferred me and then they hung up on me.  I swear I did not yell or talk loud.","Positive"
"10740","its amazing","Positive"
"10741","Things like is it close to any other electronic items, cordless phone, etc. the first guy had me on my browser on my pic, and unplugging my wifi box, I was getting scared that my Pc would get messed up to get the echo to work.  Extremely nervous.  Still trying - grandson coming Christmas.","Negative"
"10742","Great artificial intelligence device.  The Echo is the best artificial intelligence device I'll used thus far.","Positive"
"10743","ever happy with it","Positive"
"10744","Love this thing.  Mostly use it for music (amazon prime) timers and as a white noise maker at night.  Very easy to use.  I would like to do more like listen to podcasts and other streaming services which I think you can do.  I would like not have to hunt around websites to find out how to do more stuff with it.  Why can't amazon have a single place that teaches you how to do stuff in a step by step manner.  Like loop a song or stream a website etc....","Positive"
"10745","Amazing product.help me too go tru the day. With my memos alarm. This product is out of the hook","Negative"
"10746","She only understands half the things I say and she doesn't know what sound a whale makes. Might give it away and get a Google one.","Positive"
"10747","NEEDS to roll dice like IRC.","Positive"
"10748","I am having trouble with it...Keeps making me set up wi fi again...agrivating","Negative"
"10749","Love our Echo! Sound is great quality!","Positive"
"10750","Very cool.  Not too practical yet but fun.","Positive"
"10751","thought I could ask for any radio station, like FM and SiriusXM, but you can't","Positive"
"10752","Speaker has great sound and we love the compatibility with Wemo and Honeywell Thermostats.","Positive"
"10753","This thing is pretty cool.  I know several people who have one for years so I am late to the game.  I have only had it two days so I am sure I have barely tapped into all that it can do, but it is a pretty sweet gadget and I love gadgets.","Positive"
"10754","So far so good....love it","Positive"
"10755","love echo but we cant stream because of our location so cant use her.....","Positive"
"10756","Super happy!!!!","Positive"
"10757","We love our Alexa and have bought others the echo dots for the holidays.  We like to listen to Pandora from it so it's nice to have the Echo with the speaker.  Great for questions, timers, and an easy way to keep a shopping and to-do list.","Positive"
"10758","Alexa is a great technology tool with personality.","Positive"
"10759","Had the Echo for several months and I really like it.","Positive"
"10760","It ""Learns"" pretty quickly.","Positive"
"10761","Currently the Google Home limits what music player you can use,","Negative"
"10762","Google supports Google Play, Spotify Premium ($9/mo), Youtube , and Pandora.","Positive"
"10763","Sound is pretty good, a little bit lower bass.","Positive"
"10764","I don't like the manual volume control on the Google,","Positive"
"10765","  you have to touch & move your finger in  a circle on the top surface, and it doesn't always respond.","Positive"
"10766","Also looks like you need to buy Google products through Google store for controlling lights & the like.","Positive"
"10767","Very disappointed. Excessive base distorts music and makes verbal very difficult to understand. Have almost given up.","Negative"
"10768","I will update after I play with it a little more.","Positive"
"10769","So far the Echo is much better as far as I am concerned.","Negative"
"10770","I reviewed the wrong item previously. I reviewed the tap, intending to review this item.","Negative"
"10771","I couldn't justify paying $180 for this since I don't use it to its fullest potential, but at $119 refurbished, I love it.","Positive"
"10772","Anxious to learn to use it in it's full capacity. too much to do right now w/ the holidays.","Negative"
"10773","works great","Positive"
"10774","You have to word commands or questions to its vocabulary! Somewhat limited in knowledge. Works well with Hue lighting.","Positive"
"10775","Awesome product!!!!","Positive"
"10776","like","Positive"
"10777","My family uses this primarily for playing music and to keep a shopping list, which I can pull up on my Alexa app when in the store.  Even though we have a whole-house sound system, the sound quality from this Echo is so good that we hardly miss the expensive system.  This morning I heard my daughter say ""Alexa, add hair clips to the shopping list"" and my son say ""Alexa, play Toby Mac.""  Voice recognition is freakishly good.","Positive"
"10778","Unbelievable sound and quality.","Negative"
"10779","Absolutely love my ECHO!","Positive"
"10780","OMG ~~ I love this. So easy to set up and start.  So glad I saw this on Amazon and heard about it on the radio!!","Positive"
"10781","On time delivery great gift","Positive"
"10782","I never thought about buying this but so glad we did. I have been training Alexa to monitor our Nest products and listening to her jokes. The wife and I love this and wish we would have bought it sooner. We are still learning how to use Alexa and this is the fun part about it. Love the music and the sound from this little unit. Very nice. Go ahead and get one as you will be glad you did.","Positive"
"10783","It's been a while since I indulged and bought myself a new gadget. I had been looking at the Echo for a while and when it was on sale Cyber Monday, I knew I had to get it. I've only had it for a day (will update this review later) and so far I love it!","Positive"
"10784","First of all, it arrived three weeks early, which was amazing. It also couldn't have been more easy to set up. You just plug it in and then install the app on your phone/tablet. Then it's ready to go. So simple and quick.","Positive"
"10785","The voice recognition software is great. Like any of these products, having a fan in the background can distort your voice and make it hard for Alexa to understand. I had to repeat commands a few times, but only when the fan was on. For everything else, it was completely accurate.","Positive"
"10786","It has a lot of very functional uses. You can add things to your shopping list and to-do list, ask it anything you would ask google (facts, weather, sports, etc), ask the time, set alarms/timers, play music and control volume. I have used all of those functions and they work well. The alarm sound is perfect. I was worried it would be a loud and jarring sound, but it wasn't.","Positive"
"10787","The main reason I wanted to buy the echo is Alexa herself. I wanted to see if she really was a step up from Siri or Cortana. And I am very pleased! She is more than just a functional program, she has a funny and nice personality with answers for a lot of random questions/commands. My favorites so far are ""Alexa, tell me a story"" and ""Alexa, do you have children?""","Positive"
"10788","I was so impressed with the speaker performance of the Echo that I'm trying Amazon Music. It just sounds fantastic. So far I have been able to find all except 2 songs I requested (out of about 20). 1 was a live performance so that's understandable, and the other was by a lesser-known band. Overall I'm very happy with the music selection. The volume controls are great, so convenient. And I have to say again, the audio quality is AMAZING. I was not holding my breath, because the echo is so small. So I was very pleasantly surprised.","Positive"
"10789","""I'm sorry, I could not find the answer to your question.""  This thing sucks. Get the Google one. I wish I never wasted 200$ on this thing","Negative"
"10790","Skills are hit-or-miss. They are very easy to install, you just click ""enable"" and wait a few seconds. Most of them are great and work as described, but for some of them the voice commands don't work or the answers are jumbled (especially if it's reading from a live feed). Some of my favorites are chat bot (hilarious insults & really sweet compliments) and Motivate Me Please.","Positive"
"10791","Nothing is perfect though, here are the downsides of Echo:","Negative"
"10792","This device will record every single command that you use. You can view your history in Echo settings and listen to your voice. It creeped me out at the first time I found it, because I missed this aspect of the product when I was doing my research. I guess it makes sense though, that is how Alexa ""learns"" to recognize your voice more accurately. And on the bright side, you can delete anything you want and there is also a way to disable this feature altogether if it bothers you.","Negative"
"10793","Also, there are many questions where Alexa answers ""I don't have an opinion on that"". But to be fair, I was trying to throw really random questions at it. It does have a lot of really great answers too.","Positive"
"10794","Great product works as described","Positive"
"10795","Disappointed in the Echo's ability to handle simple information queries. I asked what the proper water temperature was for brewing coffee, rephrasing about a dozen different ways, unable to answer, the same with ""what sound does a chickadee make?"" She said that she doesn't have the answer but could tell me what a cat sounds like. Also asked what deciduous trees are and where maple syrup comes from and the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy meaning of life. She couldn't find any answers. Thinking of going with the Google home for information queries.","Positive"
"10796","Love Alexa!!","Positive"
"10797","Love it, just having the music abilities is worth it! I have a prime membership ..meaning i have free music.. great speaker sound,fits perfectly with the kids tablets and fire tv..alexa's abilities are limited but growing and the kids like talking to it..it does alot more....weather,news,jokes,horoscopes,find my phone,control of it from my cell phone,ordering stuff but I mainly use it for the music.","Positive"
"10798","Would be great if it had batteries and were more portable. I think because of the size for home use you shouldngo with the dot.","Positive"
"10799","Perfect!!","Positive"
"10800","this is great I love it.","Positive"
"10801","Love the Echo. The Echo does so much and I have so much information at my fingertips.","Positive"
"10802","Love it , I just wish they do more with TV and harmony logic remotes for the TV.  I love to be able to control Tv and my stereo through Echo , I know they working on it, but I hope they do it quickly.","Positive"
"10803","Also,  I read reviews on the portability of the accessory making portable for 50 dollars and the reviews are mixed, I hope they work on that too. Is a hassle to unplug and replug the echo when you take to another room.","Positive"
"10804","Don't get me wrong, I highly recommend it.","Negative"
"10805","Works great. Sounds great.  I love it.","Positive"
"10806","The setup was easy and it began to work with my voice commands, no problem.  My music library came up immediately.  However, I am an Apple user and was shocked to discover the calendar only works with Google...really????  What a huge limitation. Several other things I would have expected like Contact info, not as important but...","Positive"
"10807","A woman that doesnt talk back when you ask her dumb questions.  Bought another for upstairs.  Would marry again.","Negative"
"10808","Adding a lot of skills, and trying to learn how to use it, kids love it, they use it constantly as well as my fiance, I still have very high hopes for the skills to come, can't wAit to integrate sms messages and facebook of course, our echo is super fun and the potential in my mind is huge. Can't wAit to get the home accessories","Positive"
"10809","Most difficult device to connect to internet! Newly Purchased  device and still can't connect it to the internet. And of course no technical support anywhere to be found Ugh!!! Amazon help articles is useless!!!! Send this expensive crap back!","Negative"
"10810","Loved the Echo so much, I gave mine to my mother. The one I bought to replace it arrives tomorrow! My mother in law and my sister are the next gift recipients. Great quality and love Alexa maintaining my shopping list!","Positive"
"10811","We really like it!!!","Positive"
"10812","My expectations for this device was pretty high after seeing the adds on YouTube and the reviews from others. The Echo has surpassed my expectations and I'm sure will end up in a central point in the house until I can get another one or two more!  My wife and I can't stop playing with it!","Positive"
"10813","I could not set it up even though I brought in my office tech support.  Spoke to Amazon tech support who said it is because my wifi connection was working through an extender and it must connect to the wifi signal coming directly from the router.  I had to return it. I gave it 2 stars because I think this should have been disclosed prominently.  A lot of people use extenders and it is a waste of their time to play around trying to set up something that cannot work.","Positive"
"10814","Love it.","Positive"
"10815","LOVE it. Bought another one for my Daughter for her Christmas gift.","Positive"
"10816","Fill's my 10K sq. ft. hangar with music without any noticeable distortion. Easy to use when my hands are covered in grease and I want to change a song or turn the volume up/down. Great for a shop setting so I'd imagine it'd be great in a house too.","Positive"
"10817","Would be nice if eventually you could teach Alexa to only accept certain voices because the other mechanics like to mess with me by adding folk polka and teeny bopper music to my playlist when I'm not in earshot.","Negative"
"10818","great product","Positive"
"10819","All it needs is a clock display that blinks 12:00 because it isn't any more useful than other devices that do that such as a VCR or coffee maker. Maybe I will use it as a paper weight. I have no other use for it.  I imagine it will go the way of other Amazon products like their telephone. I should have known better than to buy this after they discontinued selling the phone I bought. Somehow I was stupid enough to think it would be able to control another useless POS device called Wink. There are two problems with that 1) Echo can't even do simpler tasks let alone understand how a home automation system should work, and 2) the Wink is just as worthless as the Echo and doesn't even work with devices sold by Wink let alone others I already had. One of these years I will take them both apart and put the electronics to better use in something else.","Positive"
"10820","Love the echo.","Positive"
"10821","It worked great for about a month.  They for some reason it stopped working.  I spent more than 2 hours on the phone with Amazon tech support and got nowhere'.  We called AT&T and never got anywhere.  I'm moving over to Google.  Amazon should stay out of the hardware business!  Very frustrated, very dissatisfied with Echo and Amazon.","Positive"
"10822","This device works just the way it should.  I did have to ""start it up"" with my computer rather than my phone, but once up it has fulfilled all the hype that Amazon gives it.  The sound is adequate for what it is--and I listen to music through my stereo system, not through echo.  It is a great way to get instant weather, find strange conversational tidbits, and other fun things.  I wish you could change the voice to male, but am settling for just using echo as a name rather than Alexis.  I have recommended this product and would definitely buy it again,  I don't know why I waited so long...","Positive"
"10823","Love it!!!  Super easy to set up!!","Positive"
"10824","I love the hands free operation......love asking questions and recieving answers, correct ones!<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084>","Positive"

"10826","wife loves it","Positive"
"10827","I am amazed at the response time. Almost finished setting Alexa with home automation and it's working great. LOVE IT. Thanks","Positive"
"10828","I love my Echo, had some issues with internet connectivity and it caused all sorts of weird things, like randomly stop playing music, speaker popping, unable to answer questions, etc.  Lots of weird stuff...  I ordered a replacement device after customer service recommended it since it seemed like it just was defective.  The replacement was doing the same thing, I played with my router settings and joined the frequencies and that solved my issues.","Negative"
"10829","CAUTION!!!  I sent the replacement back, got refunded, and ONE MONTH LATER was billed for not sending the device back.  I had proof I sent it back, and they are refunding me in 2 business weeks.  Unacceptable and should be illegal. I got $5 for my trouble, 20 mins searching for the UPS receipt, and 15 minutes on the phone with Amazon.","Negative"
"10830","Being from the black and white television generation, this is new ground for me. I am very pleased and would recommend it to anyone. It is","Positive"
"10831","straight foreword and easy to set up and use. It gets to be habit forming, in a good way.","Positive"
"10832","I have a tv sound system and can't figure out how to get them to sinc","Positive"
"10833","The speaker is high quality and what it SHOULD be able to do is impressive, but it does not work reliably and I regret spending so much extra for the Alexa features.","Positive"
"10834","Love it, she listens to me more then my wife, lol","Positive"
"10835","Alexa is amazing, I am a tech guy and this is the next step in home automation.  I find myelf using alexa more and more and can't wait when new skills and connected products come out!  Must buy!","Positive"
"10836","Echo cannot play content on a FireTV. Echo cannot interact with another Echo or an Echo Dot. Echo is not a finished product.","Positive"
"10837","For what Echo does, it does it fairly well. Unfortunately, it is still lacking basic integration with Amazon products. Do not invest in an unsupported ecosystem.","Negative"
"10838","Despite working well with myriad 3rd party applications and devices, Amazon has still not integrated any of their own devices. It's completely unacceptable that my Echo cannot interact with my FireTV or Echo dot. It's a broken ecosystem that is going to get trounced by Google Home if they can't fix search and they don't integrate with their own devices. I can play something on a significantly less powerful chromecast from google home with no issues. It's basic functionality.","Positive"
"10839","Works great and kids love interacting with Alexa","Positive"

"10842","Works as described. The assessories like lights and locks are cost prohibitive. If this is why you are buying Alexa be prepared to pay severa hundred dollars for just for the basics.","Positive"
"10843","Love, love, love! Perfect for me.","Positive"
"10844","Best thing I ever bought!!!","Positive"
"10845","great product","Positive"
"10846","very cool  though it has to do a better job in sorting out requests for information.  also, eventually y'all have to not require ""skills"" to be added to get information.  two concerns...  the next year will be devisive in who wins this market -- amazon / google / apple / microsoft.  good luck; i am hoping for you.","Positive"
"10847","Will learn to love it when I can learn to do more things with it.  Did the meditation today....gerat experience.","Positive"

"10855","I own 4 of these. They are so easy to use and love the quality of the sound. I have told so many family and friends about Echo. I love to see their faces when out of the blue I talk to Alexa and she answers me. Could not be happier.","Positive"
"10856","Love her!","Positive"
"10857","My new BFF!!! Love it...","Positive"
"10858","This was a birthday gift, I love it, and I haven't even scratched the surface of all it can do.","Positive"
"10859","Wish I could change her name. Other than that Alexa is awesome!","Positive"
"10860","We're having fun with it","Positive"
"10861","Echo is a must in every house.","Positive"
"10862","I love the Echo but there are some downsides.  The inability to select a name of your own choosing is annoying especially when you leave the default name of Alexa on it and then a commercial comes on for the Echo.  I have had her start playing music based on what the commercial was asking for.  I have two homes and have an Echo at both homes.  They are both tied to the same Amazon account which is fine but there is no way to differentiate them in the Alexa app so you can have different settings based on what's in the home.  For example when I ask for my travel time at one house it tells me the travel to the airport as I have set up in the app.  However when I am at the other house and I ask her the same question she gives me travel time from that house which is over 1500 miles away to the same airport and not the local airport there.  I also have Phillip Hue lighting in both houses.  The list of my light bulbs and rooms are always on the app for both homes so I can't have office as a room in both houses.  I have to have office in one house and then make up a code word for the office in the other house.  I can only hope that as time moves forward that the programmers take a step back and enhance what is already there to make it better instead of constantly adding new content without addressing concerns over the current issues.","Positive"
"10863","It couldn't be easier to use, or more intuitive. And the sound in a large room is BOSE-quality. Bravo, Amazon. I'll be buying one for myself soon enough.","Positive"
"10864","I love my echo in white goes with my decor. When I got it I had my son hook it up and I was amazed at the sound. It sounded better than the echo dot, way better and I also bought the rechargeable base too. I can take it anywhere in my home or outside on my front porch or patio. I just love it especially when I talk to it. I think my husband loves it cause it you can tell it what to do. Like cut on and off the lights or order something or ask it questions like the weather and time. It's just great having around the house.im even thinking of taking it with me when we go out of town on our little getaway trip. Thanks amazon you've done it again<f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+008F><U+00BF><U+2764><U+FE0F><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083>","Positive"
"10865","it keeps getting better.","Positive"
"10866","I got this as a Christmas gift for my husband, we love it just wished I would have known how much it was going on sale for!","Positive"
"10867","I love my Echo.  It's not perfect, but most of the time it knows what you are asking and responds with valuable information.  I gave it 4 stars because there is definitely still room for improvement.  The nice thing is that Amazon and other developers are constantly adding new skills to make it even better.  I can't wait to see what's next for Echo!","Positive"
"10868","GREAT PRODUCT!!","Positive"
"10869","We have lots of fun with Alexa. Wish she could control our smart TV and would hook up with my iPhone but other than that it's great.","Positive"
"10870","It's so cool to just yell out a question - Alexa answers and arguments are avoided.... How old is Tom Brokaw?  How many students attend Ohio State University?  When did Lucille Ball die?  I'm looking forward to playing a game of Trivial Pursuits with Alexa on my team.....","Positive"
"10871","And, just say, ""Alexa, play my favorites"" and here comes my Amazon Music playlist.  Great sound, great device, love it!","Positive"
"10872","We love our Echo and find ourselves using more features every day!","Positive"
"10873","wish it could connect to audio out. had to get the echo dot to accomplish this. looking forward to new usable skills to be added.","Positive"
"10874","It's fabulous. I just wish it linked up to my Apple products without such a hassle.","Positive"
"10875","I like it","Positive"
"10876","Great sound but BING stinks!  I was hoping they would partner with Google but Google decided to compete with them.  If you want to listen to music, sync a calendar, hear the weather it is great but if you want it to search the internet don't waste your money.","Positive"
"10877","Got this for my husband for his birthday...he set it up the same night.  He loves it.  Alexa has been busy playing all his favorite ""hair band"" music.","Positive"
"10878","The best, love it and glad I got it.","Positive"
"10879","Love my Echo","Positive"
"10880","Awesome product and use everyday. Purchased one for each of my sons too. Alexa controls my lights, music, news and now my ecobee3. I have several products I am planning to add too.","Positive"
"10881","As expected. I am happy with my echo purchase.","Positive"
"10882","I am hoping Updates will cure some of the problems. If not it'll be ""Alexa Return yourself to Amazon""","Negative"
"10883","Tried without success to connect it to my Blackberry Passport.","Positive"
"10884","Good job Amazon.  It works so well that I bought some of your stock.","Positive"
"10885","It kept coming up with error 4148.","Negative"
"10886","I can see a lot of possibilities here and Alexa has a very close to human voice.","Positive"
"10887","This is definitely worth the sale price.","Positive"
"10888","(Maybe because I'm a Prime member?)","Positive"

"10890","Ok device , have to call Alexa several times on occasion , kinda like having little kids that won't listen.","Positive"
"10891","aside from the news services that you can get a ""briefing"" from (1 or ALL of them),","Positive"

"10895","For pod cast and radio shows , it takes very specific info to work.","Positive"
"10896","After a year or so of owning this i have to say im a fan of it then im not my remote has now died and wont work tryed everything i can do my echo heats up bad when it in use and now that its being fazed out by new one i feel like i should have waited for the new ones. so beside the remotes going out and heating up i guess it an okay speaker just dont expect good audio out of it","Positive"
"10897","Disappointed to be honest ..","Negative"
"10898","A very entertaining product. It listens, it play songs, answer questions, and many other functions. Very pleased with its features.","Positive"

"10903","I absolutely love you can connect it to many smart devices.  Works fabulous at giving news, weather, sports updates.  So glad we bought it.","Positive"
"10904","great fun for the whole family","Positive"
"10905","Good music player and the speakers are ok as well.","Positive"
"10906","find deals easy","Positive"
"10907","This is the most useful thing I have bought in a long time. It is wonderful for my home automation system. It works great with Wink. There are few things Alexa can't do. Love it. And the sound is great too.","Positive"
"10908","When I first bought this I wasn't quite sure how to use it but now I am crazy about it. Everyone in my family fights over who's going to control her LOL we absolutely love her","Negative"
"10909","Quick shipping.  Great product...easy to set up and delivers very good sound","Positive"
"10910","Interesting that you can have Alexa read to you the Koran but not the Holly Bible. Shameful. If I'd known this I would not have bought it.","Negative"
"10911","Sound quality is very poor the voice commands are so so.  It's still a gimmick.","Negative"
"10912","She Is Awesome","Positive"
"10913","This is a quality item.","Positive"
"10914","I love my Echo!  I use it constantly to schedule appointments, add to a grocery list, get sports updates, answer questions and light & thermostat control. There is always room for improvement with new technology, but the Echo is definitely ahead of the game.  I also recently bought a Google Home, but they have a ways to go to catch up with the features if the Echo.  I also prefer the looks of the Echo to the Google Home.(It reminds me of an air freshener)  For those that like white instead of black, Echo now comes in white. I like my black.","Positive"
"10915","4-7-17 update, have to call Alexa several times to recognize , have to be incredibly specific to get a radio station, can no longer find podcast that it did a few weeks ago.","Positive"
"10916","We absolutely love our echo! great for music and games!!  i love it as a cooking timer as well.  we love that our smart home devices can be easily voice controlled!  it makes shopping easy!!","Positive"
"10917","Amazing!!! Does everything it was advertised to do! Great sound!","Positive"
"10918","Awesome!!!  purely life changing!","Positive"
"10919","Works much of the time but not always. I use it in my kindergarten classroom for lots of stuff. The kids love it for our music, adding, subtracting & spelling. Many times she doesn't understand & says so or plays the wrong song. But we still love her!","Positive"
"10920","Very cool.","Positive"
"10921","Love my Echo, works well and is a fun addition to the home.","Positive"
"10922","Voice command is not responding all the time. It is annoying when I am sitting down and have to get up to press buttons to use voice command. But It is great for information. I use it all the time.","Negative"
"10923","So far, I've really enjoyed using the Echo for various tasks... especially music! The one complaint I have is that with some song names (i.e. Dragon Slayer and Road Trip by NSP and various other songs in my library), Echo won't play the song and will instead redirect you to some other song, album, or artist. It's quite annoying, but not the end of the world. You CAN go into your amazon music library through the alexa app and play any song from there, but that kind of defeats the purpose of the whole voice operating thing. Anyways, if you're going to utilize ALL of the features of Echo and not just music, I say it's an overall fantastic buy!","Positive"
"10924","works well","Positive"
"10925","This might be favorite item ever bought.  I wear out the music too.  This thing puts out a good amount of sound too.  you can spend lots of time looking for easter eggs.","Positive"
"10926","I have a $180 Brick.  No support from Amazon.  I also have one of their smaller units called an Echo dote which has the ""blue ring of death.""  The problem around this device is that there is basically no support or service.  I have three that work well and I have three that will not work at all regardless of what I do.  My suggestion is to avoid this at all costs until Amazon provides support for these devices, which they do not.","Positive"
"10927","Volume levels are impossible to get just right, should have a manual control.","Positive"
"10928","Great!!!!","Positive"
"10929","Quite the amazing product!  Makes listening to even the most obscure music delightfully easy.  The sound is excellent as well.  Just beginning to test out other things that my new, ever cooperative friend Alexa can do.","Positive"
"10930","Quite an intriguing and entertaining device...oh! It's useful too.","Positive"
"10931","We love Alexa - my three year old and I went from having dance parties listening to music on my iPhone to being able to use our ""robot"" to play our music for us!  I love listening to my daughter try to talk to Alexa.  I'm sure we're completely under utilizing her, as I know she has tons of functionality.  But the three year old is very protective of what we ask Alexa to do.","Positive"
"10932","I like it but it seems quite glitchey at times . Just one example I played thunderstorm to sleep by it would not turn off no voice command I physically hit the buttons on the unit and it would not turn off .the same thing in some of the other apps .","Positive"
"10933","Sound is great! Wonderful to fill the house with my music choices!","Positive"
"10934","so far she and i are not having good conversations . My questions must be too difficult . .","Negative"
"10935","I have not been able to use it as Alexa is not available in Nicaragua where I live. This was unknown to be before purchasing it.","Negative"
"10936","But both an echo and a dot. Functionality seems somewhat limited.","Negative"
"10937","Was initially some what satisfied with device originally, not so now , almost forgot could not even get a simple baked chicken recipe.","Positive"
"10938","Love Alexa! I don't know how I dealt with my other music contraptions. Always had to fuss with either the computer, changing CD's or looking up songs to play. Alexa does it all! Even tells me jokes that make me laugh out loud!","Negative"
"10939","Awsome product!!!  I use it with a smart things hub and Alexa voice control.","Positive"
"10940","I absolutely love it, just wish I could get it to change the channels and change the name","Positive"
"10941","Each day brings new uses. So much fun. A great invention.","Positive"
"10942","Love it use it more everyday","Positive"
"10943","This item doesn't respond on a regular basis when given commands should have sent it back, told to play a station can't hear it on echo but you can see it playing if you open the app. like it muted","Positive"
"10944","You have to download an app for everything you want her to do for you.  It is not good for someone who is not technology savvy.","Positive"
"10945","Amazing! My husband loves it!","Positive"
"10946","I wanted an Echo as soon as I started seeing them advertised. My husband asked what I wanted for Chirstmas and I thought it was the perfect opportunity to get one. I instantly fell in love with it! I am a music freak and this was just what I needed to play my music list when I am doing housework. I talk to Alexa all the time and find more features as I go. Each morning, I ask her the weather forecase and she delivers. My husband loves asking her jokes, playing Jeopardy, and getting his ""flash report"". You have to check this out!","Positive"
"10947","Received on time and as promised","Positive"
"10948","Amazing","Positive"
"10949","Fun to use. Still learning all it can do. Somewhat easy to setup even if you're 73 years old.","Positive"
"10950","Can anyone really say anything bad about the Echo?  I've got several friends interested in getting one because of the awesome things I say about the Echo","Negative"
"10951","Best gift ever!! Not only informative but entertaining as well. Would recommend to everyone.","Positive"
"10952","Absolutely love Alexa! I don't have many songs on my phone (being of the older generation :) so I agreed to the free 1 month AMazon music membership. I will definitely continue the membership for $3.99 a month  moving forward. Had some friends over for dinner recently and they were so impressed tha they are going to get one. Alexa is so sensitive to her name that she lights up if you are just having a conversation. Be careful though if you have someone named Alexa in your house!","Positive"
"10953","Broke down, has to be returned. Does not recognize voice commands.","Negative"
"10954","Alexa is like having a good friend in the house","Positive"
"10955","We love Alexa, although we hope it give it a unique name that we as a family select. When can the Amazon Echo Tech Team support this?","Positive"
"10956","Great sound works well.  it only lacks the ability to answer research questions.  If Amazon could have tied in with Google they would have had a winner.  But for getting the time, weathe sports scores etc. it works fine.","Positive"
"10957","Why spend all the money on a brand new one when you can get one of these. Not a scratch on it, works perfectly, and comes in new packaging","Positive"
"10958","I put off buying this because it usually turns out to be a hassle to learn how to use a high-tech product.  But thing is SO EASY to set up and use that I regret waiting so long.  I use it for listening to radio programs, getting spelling and definitions for words, and almost every morning I get the weather.  I haven't set up music lists or such yet but I know they are available.  For now, I just ask for specific songs.  A side benefit is getting a song which is stuck in your head because you have forgotten part of the lyrics.  The headline could have been ""End your earbugs!""","Positive"
"10959","The sound quality when playing music is excellent, especially when compared to the Google Home - which I did side-by-side. The microphone also has good range; it can hear a command from another room or floor of my house. My only complaint is that the set up was a little more difficult than expected (I had to contact customer service as the included directions were not clear) and it cannot answer questions like Google Home can. Once the number of available apps increases and the device has access to a good search engine, I will rate it a 5-star. I would also like to see Amazon include a 1 year membership in Amazon Music with the device, rather than a 30 day membership. The cost to Amazon would be minimal but the advantage over the Google Home would be tremendous.","Positive"
"10960","This was my first purchase in my smart home upgrade plan. So far, this thing does everything I could expect. She even tells jokes!","Positive"
"10961","My wife loves it.","Positive"
"10962","LOVE IT......","Positive"
"10963","Love love love it","Positive"
"10964","GReat Gadget","Positive"
"10965","Does everything and more but needs glitch updates. Sometimes stops playing music but did a hard reset and it seems to ok!","Negative"
"10966","Ok a week later I figured it out. I google everything when I have a question but you have to ask Alexa to Wikipedia everything because it Won't connect to Google....I find that is Sucks as i don't like being directed to any specific web site. If I can type it on my phone or iPad I shoul be able to direct it by voice. Would I buy this again.....I'm still on the fence but I am removing a star","Positive"
"10967","Lowering it to two stars as it's an expensive audio/thermostat/light switch....","Negative"
"10968","So when you connect it via blue tooth to your phone or pad you still have to manually select the music you want to hear. One more star loss within the month and I'll drop kick it back to Amazon.","Negative"
"10969","excellent item","Positive"
"10970","I'm really trying to like this thing, trying to give it the benifit that I'm doing something incorrect but wtf....","Negative"
"10971","Well, that was easy... My niece loves her Echo, so when it went on sale I grabbed it. So glad I did. Even my husband, who is techno-averse, loves it. The only problem is that when he asks me if I ""think Alexa can do xxx"", Alexa thinks he's asking her a question and keeps apologizing. Not a bad problem to have, actually. Aside from feeling like we should rename her ""Hal"", no regrets.","Positive"
"10972","Would have been nice if it was wireless","Positive"
"10973","Not hapy with this so far. I have had it a week and still can not get it to connect to my hue hub or my z wave lock. I had to re run setup several times! I know many people like this however I get more IDK answers from it then I get actual answers. I used it side by side with Google home and it did not fair well. Google home answered so many more questions. The only thing this has over  google is the puck. you have to get the google home unit for each room you want to use it in but the echo can add the puck at a lower price to other rooms. If you want more answers get Google. Echo at this time also lists more thing it can connect to, however I am having issues connecting it to anything!","Positive"
"10974","love it!","Positive"
"10975","love it!!!!","Positive"
"10976","What can be said about this unit.  I am another satisfied customer specially with the kitchen apps.  Highly recommended.","Positive"
"10977","Very nice product, came early which is good.","Positive"
"10978","Incredible!","Positive"
"10979","Alexa is the bomb!!!!!  A++++++++++","Negative"
"10980","Of course I love it, what else is there to say!!!!!!!","Positive"
"10981","Love it use it all the time","Positive"
"10982","Love it~  We use it constantly.","Positive"
"10983","We use it mostly to add items to our shopping and to do lists as well as stream radio, music and podcasts. Oh, and we ask Alexa the forecast every day. Sets up easily, links readily to phone bluetooth and a good sounding speaker. Sound quality will change dramatically depending on placement in your room, experiment with different locations to optimize listening experience.","Positive"
"10984","I like it. Echo will not pair with my UE Megaboom speaker. If it did I would have given it 5 stars.","Positive"
"10985","NO! I can order off Amazon, turn on off my lights to save energy and can control my thermostat. WHOO. She never runs out of jokes and will sing happy birthday. :)","Positive"
"10986","I'm having a blast with my new Amazon Echo!  I have used it to speel, OPPS ""spell"" words; check the weather; play music, specific music.  It is surprisingly responsive even from across the room.  I was impressed at how well it was packaged.  I was a little over zealous and didn't initially read the instructions so delayed my set up but once read, it was pretty straight forward.  YOU DO NEED INTERNET to use any on the ALEXA products (Echo, Dot or Tap) so if you are purchasing this as a gift, make sure the recipient has it.","Positive"
"10987","A good resource to see what the Echo can do can be found at: http://alexa.amazon.com/spa/index.html#cards","Positive"
"10988","I have been in the home Automation Industry for 30 years and get to play with ultra cool things all day long so it takes a lot to get me excited about most products as so many disappoint. I have to say I was a little skeptical about this unit when I purchased it as I have dealt with Siri for years and absolutely hate her as she rarely works so my expectation levels for anything with voice commands was going to be low. Well I tell you that is not the case with the Echo unit as it works unbelievably great as far as voice recognition goes and the abilities to do simple things like getting the weather and the news or turning on a internet radio station is a breeze. I would say that Alexa ( The devices name )  works to do the task you ask about 85-90 percent of the time whereas Siri does maybe 25 percent at best, in addition Alexa is just a better name as well:) . I operate a Home Automation company and I can see us putting these to great use in our clients homes to control all the devices in their homes by voice as well as remotes or iOS devices.","Positive"
"10989","Because it should have come with a really good instruction manual (like in paperback format)","Positive"
"10990","The overall Sound of the Echo is not bad for background music or for a small area but would not be something you would want to use for a big area. I would recommend that if you already have an existing audio system and are looking for a great way to add music options and voice control than the Echo Dot may be a better choice as it allows hookup to an existing system whereas the Echo is designed to be a standalone speaker.","Positive"
"10991","I will be doing some further setup and research on Echo voice control of Lutron Lighting and Shade controllers so I will do a follow up review and let people know how well it works.","Positive"
"10992","I thought about getting one for ages but wasn't convinced.  But, after talking to a friend who has one and finding a great deal on the Echo through QVC, I bought it.  I love it.  I always have trouble getting things up and running but this was so simple I didn't any difficulty syncing things up and was listening to music in no time.  Alexa is totally incorporated into my life.  She keeps my to do list for me,  She adds my shopping list to my iPhone.  She reads my audible books to me and wakes me up in the morning. She's funny too.  Today I said ""Alexa how is your day going"". She replied. ""My day is going just fine"". And she added something about how nice it was to have me around"". Another time I had turned her off and all of a sudden she started talking as if she was.interacting with someone.  I asked her what she was doing and she said she was updating some things and learning new things.  No, I'm not crazy.  My husband heard our conversation and he said she was kind of amazing.  I got him the dot and he's just getting started with it but is amazed.  Get one or more.  You'll love her!","Positive"
"10993","We love our echo!!! We have now purchased 5 echo's for our family members. Everyone that see'S how many things you can do with this becomes jealous and wants one for themselves. We have smart light switches and an outlet plug. We plan to get the thermostat soon too. I would say we use it the most for turning on and off lights every morning and evening or when leaving the house with hands so full it's a talent, and also all the music! Just ask her to play a song that's stuck in your head and she will do it!! You can repeat, pause, skip.. you can ask her questions, what the temperature is outside or when your favorite basketball team is playing next so","Positive"
"10994","You can watch it on TV. 200% recommend.","Positive"
"10995","After less than 18 months of mediocre performance, my Echo apparently resigned.","Negative"
"10996","Awesomely Amazing! Alexa is our family's best friend. Every household needs one of these. Very ingenious.","Positive"
"10997","I got the amazon echo on Black Friday so it was only $140. I love it!","Positive"
"10998","I love her.","Positive"
"10999","AAA Amazing sound and capabilities","Positive"
"11000","Had some issues with Amazon music being linked to another account, as a couple of calls to amazon they finally figured out what was going on and gotten the issue corrected. Love the Echo other then the government having another item to listen to your conversations lol. But yes this is a great product, it listens very well and can hear you from across the house.","Positive"
"11001","-Doesn't work with fire TV (think google home/chromecast)","Positive"
"11002","Wonderful addition! I like it better than siri.","Positive"
"11003","A must purchase for any home with Wi-Fi.","Positive"
"11004","If it was bluetooth capable, it would be perfect","Positive"
"11005","Where would I be without Alexia?  I have to admit that one of my most guilty pleasure shopping splurges has been the Amazon Echo and I totally love it!! There are a million and one things that my Alexia can do, and I love that it continually learns.  You never know the full array of features it offers until you actually own one and begin to use and customize it to your specific needs/likes.  I honestly feel that I hardly utilize mine to the fullest capacity.  You can ask it to wake you up, read you a story, play you music, give you recipes, it even kept me up to date with the debate polls.","Positive"
"11006","I think that one of the best features is that I can customize my Alexia to have specific skills that I like so Im not getting a cookie cutter ""application/device"".","Positive"
"11007","great product","Positive"
"11008","I love my echo!","Positive"
"11009","It s very good and i use it every day but i hear 80% of what she say: i dont know the answer. This makes so angry after a long time!","Positive"
"11010","OMG!!  It is awesome!  We love it!!","Positive"
"11011","Works great, My parents treat it better than me.","Positive"
"11012","Works very well, does what is asked better than 95% of the time, depending if i speak well. the next step would be to integrate it to my tv so i can ask for a show and have it play just like asking for a song. wonder how long i have to wait?","Positive"
"11013","Works Great! Great Sound!  I love it!","Positive"
"11014","Randomly stopped working after about two years, I am extremely pissed.","Negative"
"11015","Love it. Great for music, jeopardy is fun, we enjoy quizzing Alexa on everything.","Positive"
"11016","Love it , Great product","Positive"
"11017","Great sound but trouble with importing play list from iTunes.  Also annoying that I can't figure out how to just make her play radio from Iheart, instead she always says she can't find what I'm looking for then looks at iheart radio.  I'm willing to bet there is a way of anyone has help for me I'll take it.  Overall, we <3 her :)","Positive"
"11018","Love It, It is fun to use. I also got the Philips hue kit with hub which works great with the Echo","Positive"
"11019","The Amazon Echo is great! I put it in the general kitchen/family room area and ALEXA follows my instructions well wherever I am standing. The Echo also evolves as new software is developed for it, giving it more capabilities. What's pretty cool is that ALEXA recognizes both my and my husband's voices and will respond to play from our different music collections. Also, the sound quality is really good, which is a pleasant surprise.","Positive"
"11020","This thing does not understand a southern accent.  No matter how many apps I upload and enable,  This thing can rarely find any of the requests I put to it. I still cannot get it to connect to my Prime Music. Other than giving you a Chuck Norris fact and a slow to update weather report, it is pretty much useless.  I'm sorry I bought it.","Positive"
"11021","lots of fun with kids. just another big boy toy","Positive"
"11022","This is FABULOUS! I WISH I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THIS EONS AGO!","Positive"
"11023","Best entertainment buy I've made in years. I just bought 4 more for my adult children.","Positive"
"11024","Bought this just for fun, but now cannot imagine living without it.  It is unbelievable the things we use it for - weather reports, trivia questions, reordering items from Amazon.  We love having it in the kitchen so we can use it as a timer, but the best so far is being able to add items to a shopping list by just telling Alexa what we need.  If it only did that alone it would be worth the cost.  I know that, as time goes on, we will think of more and more things that Echo can do to make our lives easier","Positive"
"11025","This is something no human needs but it's so nice to have an imaginary companion to ask questions or set timers. It has great sound quality and gets pretty loud.","Positive"
"11026","Alexa is awesome!  Great for music and making a shopping list.  There is probably a whole lot more you can use it for but these are my 2 main uses.","Positive"
"11027","The only suggestion is to make a cordless rechargeable model that can bluetooth with external speakers.","Positive"
"11028","we love alexia","Positive"
"11029","My kids and I love this Echo!  My wife did not like it at first.  However, she loves it now!","Positive"
"11030","My wife loves her Alexa..","Positive"
"11031","Awesome","Positive"
"11032","The only con is that when it's playing music or talk it may not hear you. I purchased the remote and that solves that problem.","Negative"
"11033","I've been looking at this product for a while. I finally decided to pull the trigger over ""cyber weekend,"" and I couldn't be more pleased with my decision. The packaging came very neatly, the setup was painless and took a few minutes. Alexa recognizes when I'm trying to get her attention, responds to voice commands flawlessly, and the speaker is very good quality. I haven't yet used her to her maximum potential, but I'm very happy with my purchase. If you're on the fence about this like I was, do yourself a favor and buy it.","Positive"
"11034","This is fantastic!  Absolutely love it!","Positive"
"11035","What a FUN assistant. Love the music, info, etc. Alexa is a hit with everyone in the house.","Positive"
"11036","I recieved this as a gift fro, my mom","Positive"
"11037","Such a handy device! Need a quick calculation, weather, a joke, timer, alarm, to do list, music, or need to know who stars in a particular movie? Echo is great for that! However it cannot answer complex questions and I was really looking forward to being able to use it for questions like that.","Positive"
"11038","clever, informative, great sound & entertainment galore!","Positive"
"11039","Echo is the most amazing device to date! Love it!!!!","Positive"
"11040","not good","Positive"
"11041","This is amazing, just love my Amazon Echo.","Positive"
"11042","Having so much fun with Alexa","Positive"
"11043","We are really enjoying ""Alexa"".  We are still learning all the things she can do.","Positive"
"11044","Really like these devices. Hope to eventually have a lot of devices running through it. Speaker aound wasn't as great as i had hoped, based on other reviews. I can run it through my other speakers when needed. Really liked the careful packing job done by Amazon.","Positive"
"11045","Voice recognition is decent. You definitely have to train it. Mostly it struggles with odd album and band names.","Negative"
"11046","Awesome! Wonderful sound. Plenty of tight bottom end. Pair this with Unlimited music or Spotify and everything music is on demand. Alexa is pleasant too.","Positive"
"11047","Works great. I wish it had a battery so it could be moved room to room easier.","Positive"
"11048","Works great. Easy setup","Positive"
"11049","love this! bought one for each of my children's home.","Positive"
"11050","We love the Echo.  So far everyone that comes over is so impressed with it, they end up purchasing one.  Talk to it everyday, almost like another person lives with us LOL.  Very clear and helpful.","Positive"
"11051","The speaker is good. I really enjoy asking for music and getting it as soon as I ask. It's added a lot to the Christmas feel of my house. I WOULD love the Echo if Alexa could answer more of my questions. It's really limited. Like REALLY LIMITED. Wanna know what Die Hard is rated? Alexa doesn't know. Google on my phone tells me immediately. What movies are playing at my local theater? Alexa doesn't know. Google does... But if you ask her if she prefers cats or dogs she can let you know ""she likes Toitles"" (turtles with a funny accent). While cute... I'd like more answers to my questions. I'm considering giving it away as a gift and getting a Google home just for the better responses. I'm getting sick of asking her things that seem easy for her to still not be able to get it. I just go find my phone and ask Google. Upgrade this, Amazon! You can do it!","Positive"
"11052","My wife and I have enjoyed the Echo from the first day we received it!","Positive"
"11053","I bought it a year or so ago and still can't get it working. It should come with a install stick.","Positive"
"11054","amazing. Kids are enjoying. connected to home wireless devices. working perfect","Positive"
"11055","Very happy with the unit.  It sometimes gets confused with the requests but all in all it is great entertainment - all hands free.  Visitors love to ask for songs or information. The technology will only improve and the future capabilities will increase.","Positive"
"11056","We love this product and find it very useful","Positive"
"11057","Our relationship with Alexa was great at first.  She did everything I asked her for.  Told me weather, traffic alerts, recipes and even updated my grocery list.  I was falling for her with each day.","Negative"
"11058","One day I played TuneIn Radio and all of the sudden Alexa stopped working, no music was coming out of the Echo.  I didn't think much of it until I went to sleep and around 2 am Alexa turned the TuneIn Radio back on like nothing happen.  Scarred me so much that I had to grab a golf club and go downstairs.  First, I thought I had ghosts so I grabbed my phone and called Ghost Busters.  After a quick prayer, I started yelling at Alexa and told her that she scared me but she didn't understand that so I told her to stop playing music.  I had enough, our relationship was over at that point.  I told her I am returning her but she didn't understand me again (sounds like me ex).","Positive"
"11059","I decided to return her and wait until something a little bit more reliable comes out.","Positive"
"11060","The best technology since the cassette tape! Alexa is totally awesome! From news, music, and knowledge, you have it with Alexa!","Positive"
"11061","Turns on and off my lights, plays music, tells corny jokes, answers a bunch of trivia questions and makes my life easier!","Positive"
"11062","I love my echo! It is primarily used to play music but we also check weather and sports scores. I also keep my to do list and shopping list on it.","Positive"
"11063","Love it........I'm hoping to connect additional devices maybe after the holidays when things slow down!","Negative"
"11064","Fantastic.  Love the interface.  The extension of capabilities with the many available skills is a real bonus.  Wonderful device.  Would love to be able to connect it via Bluetooth to my Bose Wavestation Radio.  Hoping to learn if that's possible.","Positive"
"11065","Doesn't do much unless you already have music downloaded to your cell phone or special outlets in your home to connect to which can be additional expenses.  Also, will spontaneously answer questions without being asked and if your music is louder than average sounds it cannot hear you and you have to yell into the top of the device.","Negative"
"11066","Awesome sound quality and I can give directions when my hands are full.  I love having the remote so I can just turn it down when I am on the phone.  Seems like Alexa needs to learn a few more commands.  I need to spend time exploring the other connections I can add.  Right now, I just use it for playing music and asking about the weather and headlines!  Cool product!","Positive"
"11067","Love my Alexa.  I'm a avid music listener.  It is so convenient.  I also use it to turn lights on and off.","Positive"
"11068","My African Grey parrot this am said ""Alexa"", ""I Love You, Alexa responded ""It's nice to be appreciated"".","Positive"
"11069","Wish I had taken more advantage of the price.  Hoping another sale comes before Christmas.  Want to order 2 more.","Positive"
"11070","I consider myself an early adopter... I was late in adopting The Echo...What took me so long this thing is fantastic..set up is a breeze,,,It's fantastic..If Steve Jobs where to design such a product this would be it....Could Amazon be the New Apple? Apple today isn't!","Positive"
"11071","I absolutely think this is so fantastic.","Positive"
"11072","one of the BEST things I have EVER got","Positive"
"11073","The setup of the device was easy. It is a great replacement to my old clock radio and user to on and off my hue lights on command. The same applies to the fact finding questions to ask Alexa on my subway schedule, Bloomberg market minutes, BBC radio, general celeb questions, weather, Amazon music choices, etc. No complaints. It was worth the cost.","Positive"
"11074","Love it and love Alexa!","Positive"
"11075","I do enjoy my echo. It was a gift. It is very useful and I can see it's potential growing. However, I really wish you could change the voice to a man's voice. I really hope that's an update some day.","Positive"
"11076","Looks and works just like a new one.","Positive"
"11077","I bought the echo for my dorm room and it will never set up properly. Bad investment!","Negative"
"11078","This is a high quality unit. Audio is rich and powerful. Better than the $200 BOSE. Now omnly if Amazon could come up with compatible device controls. Still have not been able to control lights, fans, or thermostat. If this is your end game, look elsewhere.","Positive"
"11079","This is the coolest thing ever!  Even if it cost $500, it would be worth it.  It does everything you can think of, and if you look into it a little, you'll find that it can do a whole lot of things you can't even think of.  Looking at a cell phone or computer screen is the old way.  Now you just say, ""Alexa, Weather.""  It gives you the rundown on the weather.  Hear a new word and want a definition, ask Alexa what it means.  I hear this device can read a book to you.  Want news headlines?  Just ask.  It's a great speaker that you can use over Bluetooth.  I tell it a radio station using the iHeart Radio skill, and it starts playing my favorite shows.  Want to buy something, there is a way to order by voice using this device.  Or you can turn off that feature if you don't want to use it to buy things, then there are no accidents.  It has very sensitive microphones that can hear you over things already playing.  It's very intelligent.  I thought Siri was cool, but this thing is leaps and bounds better.  This takes a personal assistant to a whole other level.  I could go on and on, but just buy one and see for yourself.","Positive"
"11080","I love my Amazon Echo.","Positive"
"11081","Five years ago, if you had asked me what company would be the leader in innovation in 2017, like most anybody, I would have insisted on Apple. I might have conceded that Samsung or Google would give Apple a run for their money, but would have ridiculed you for suggesting Amazon.","Positive"
"11082","Awesome","Positive"
"11083","Amazon's phone may have tanked, but most every other tech device is proving formidable.","Positive"
"11084","Echo is easy to setup and easy to use.","Positive"
"11085","I love it.","Positive"
"11086","The echo may be ok, however Amazon 'S customer service does not know how to make it work.","Positive"
"11087","Love it!","Positive"
"11088","I did the the trifecta, I bought the ECHO, then the DOT, then the TAP, I found out as have many,once you start using them you find all kind of  way's to utilize the technology. enjoying the product much !","Positive"
"11089","Lot of fun.","Positive"
"11090","Just amazing. I am so glad I purchased this device. It's entertaining and helpful. I bought my son and his wife one. At first they thought they wouldn't like it but guess what? They crazing about. They just love it.","Positive"
"11091","I am very pleased. The follow up emails suggest new ways to use it. Easy set up and link to other pieces.","Positive"
"11092","I really like the Echo. I have this in the bathroom. Wife listens to the news while getting ready, and I listen to music when I am getting ready.","Positive"
"11093","We missed the refurb offer at 119 bucks, but managed to snag one on the black Friday sale.  See my little review on the Echo Dot about use in Canada...same things apply.  This version, with the bigger speakers, is getting a real workout playing radio stations and music, in addition to home automation.  The sound is very nice, much better than expected.  We may bump this and the Dot up to 5-stars if they continue to delight us.","Positive"
"11094","LOVE it! The echo is the best purchase I have made in a long time.","Positive"
"11095","Fun device. Practical. Needs to keep expanding knowledge, i.e. , learning.","Positive"
"11096","I absolutely love this!!!! Set it up in my living room, the speaker is great.  Her jokes are a trip! I plan on hooking all my lights and air to be controlled through this device.  I will also be getting the Echo dots for the remaining rooms in my house. Highly recommend!! Love this product.","Positive"
"11097","Great idea and fast shipping.","Positive"
"11098","This echo is addicting when you think of all the devices it can control....what a great invention...Had thoughts about buying a refurbished model but no problems to date.","Positive"
"11099","This assistant is so much fun to use. Alexa is responsive and quick.","Positive"
"11100","The one improvement needed is Alexa's world and depth of knowledge.","Positive"
"11101","I have had this thing two and a half months after October. After following the instructions, I played with her to test her out. Sometimes she didn't understood some requests I ask from her. But each she did or did not understand any of my request, I would go to my alexa app and click on yes or no I'm the card. Apparently, over time, she is beginning to understand me better and more whenever I ask for a request, such as playing music, buying some songs I like, playing rock, paper, scissors and reading one of my kindle books. So, overall while it and it's skill are a working progress, it is still something worth trying out. If you like the amazon echo, please don't hesitate to but it.","Positive"
"11102","Love my echo  still learning new things about it,it one of my best investments","Positive"
"11103","Easy to set up, a little difficult to figure out all the features. We only use it for music and weather reports, but we play it every day.","Positive"
"11104","Having serious issues installing my New Amazon Echo...<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009D>","Negative"
"11105","just takes a bit of time to learn what you need to say to her  after that  Love it","Positive"
"11106","Not only do my wife and I enjoy Alexa, but we have purchased one for my son and his family as well as our daughter and their family. After showing Echo to my neighbor, he bought four Dots. Alexis seems to get better and better every day!","Positive"
"11107","Unbelievable sound and she gets smarter as you interact daily she also controls all the lights in my condo and tells jokes","Negative"
"11108","I like my Echo but it looks like Google Home is creeping into the scene.  Echo needs to at least fix the music call....A few others have made this comment....When you request a song sometimes Alexa has her own mind and sometime it will find the correct song and sometimes it wont and this is NOT the speech. One example.....I bought the song ""Forever Country""....Well Alexa frequently plays a SAMPLE or sometimes it will play the correct song that I BOUGHT on AMAZON in my Library.....Echo wins over Google Home....barely!","Positive"
"11109","Music calls.....Google Home wins","Positive"
"11110","Overall sound quality.....Echo EASILY wins","Positive"
"11111","Fun to use! Don't know what all it can do yet! Still learning!","Positive"
"11112","Home automation....Echo EASILY wins","Positive"
"11113","Voice recognition....Google Home wins...","Positive"
"11114","Bottom line, NOW it really depends on your preference regarding which you prefer.....Again, for me, ECHO wins....BARELY!","Positive"
"11115","I just bought the echo over black Friday. I'm still working on figuring out how to leverage it to make things easier, its not completely clear yet. Anyhow, I picked mine up for $119, which is a good price. I wouldn't pay more than that for this and don't recommend you do either.","Positive"
"11116","Love it and hope they continue to inprove with new capabilities","Positive"
"11117","Love this thing. I needed some music in my home, and it sounds great. I also use the timers and shopping list on a regular basis. It is nice to be thinking of an item I need to get and quickly tell Alexa before I forget to write it down, now I just tell Alexa and she logs it for me. She easily recognizes what I am asking and saying when I speak to her. I am sure I will use more and more features as I become more aware of them and it is ever changing and improving.","Positive"
"11118","This is wonderful. We love it!! We use it every day. Does so much. Love asking random questions we would usually look up on internet. So easy and convenient. We love the music feature and cannot wait to discover what else she can do!!","Positive"
"11119","Greatest gadget since the ......hummm....","Positive"
"11120","Love Alexa!","Positive"
"11121","I have had the Echo for 2 yrs or so and have seen it mature into a really nice platform. I am a google fanboy, so when Google Home came out and I was able to get a really nice deal, I bought it.  So, the below is based on using both products.","Positive"
"11122","From a review perspective, if you are looking for a mature product with lots of integrations/recipes to smart devices you use today, then Amazon Echo/Dot is a clear winner and you will not be happy with the relative immature nature of Google Home. I am shocked that Google didn't spend the money upfront to have significantly more recipes/integrations prior to releasing this product to effectively complete against Echo. The big feature you hear about on reviews is Google Home's ability to carry context from one question to next.  For me, If I am going to do some multi-question thing, I am not going to talk to my device, I'm just going to grab my phone or tablet, which renders this feature relatively useless to me.  The only cool feature I like is Home's ability to to cast to Chomecast audio.  It is really nice.  I hope Amazon figures out a way for me to link all my Dots and Echo together, so I can ""cast"" to Dots. So before you buy anything, make sure it integrates with the services you have today. The promise from Google of future integration is nice, however, knowing google's track record of sunsetting products, don't hold out too much hope for the long term.","Positive"
"11123","I hope this helps those trying to make a decision between the 2 devices.","Positive"
"11124","Alexa doesn't always understand me, but she's already my favorite piece of technology I've ever purchased. We use her daily.","Positive"
"11125"," LOVE this thing for everything from playing music, to just asking simple ""what's the forecast"", to home automation","Positive"
"11126"," Going to get a couple of Echo DOTS for the Master Bedroom and the office so I can get those rooms automated (lights, fans)","Positive"
"11127"," Will need to download the Echo app to your iPad or smart phone","Positive"
"11128","Randomly stopped working. Our Echo has worked well for the last year or so. We honestly don't use it for much, but it at least worked. Within the last month, it has stopped working consistently. It is having more trouble understanding us and says it is losing its connection to the internet. I have attempted to restore it, but that has not helped. Completely unreliable. I'm kind of fed up with Amazon's devices, they're great at first, but they get so buggy and become unreliable. I would not recommend it.","Positive"
"11129","Don't bother, it won't work","Negative"
"11130","Alexa is terrible at answering questions; Hey Siri and Hey Google are much much better.  I often ask Siri questions via my phone, rather than doing an internet search and thought it would be great to be able to do the same with Alexa.  So far, she is zero for zero, other than asking her the time.  My questions are not that difficult.  Very disappointed.","Negative"
"11131","Difficult product to work with. 1/2 a second after calling alexa to wakeup, it goes dark does not listen to commands given. Alexa, Play Pink Floyd --- NOTHING,","Negative"
"11132","Alexa What time is alarm set for---NOTHING. Alexa set alarm for 5:30 tomorrow---NOTHING. Maybe getting it on sale was a bad choice, but still this is an amazon product. and I am not a happy customer with this echo","Negative"
"11133","Very easy to use for all ages. Full of information. From checking the weather, to finding out what movies are out, to playing music, and ordering essentials. I am amazed at all of the capabilities this small cylinder offers. Huge timesaver. Instead of staring at a device, wasting time trying to find out information, now we just ask Alexa!","Positive"
"11134","Keeps track of my appointments grandsons sports times. Like to know the weather for work travel and plans for the week. News is easily obtained from different sources.","Positive"
"11135","Ordered 2 ""certified""/refurbished Echo's. Turned out that both of them didn't have the correct software so there was NO way they connected to the internet during setup. Spent hours on this until customer care told me: ""Please connect them to the internet as there is a new firmware version for your devices""","Positive"
"11136","Not sure how Amazon *certifies* their refurbished products. NOT a happy customer. Since I traveled to Europe bought them there and both of them worked straight out of the box (obviously I didn't go for the refurbished ones this time)..","Positive"
"11137","Now I still need to find out why Amazon charged me a fee of 60 USD for returning FAULTY products.......","Negative"
"11138","It can be fun. But many purchases needed to set up all the good stuff.","Positive"
"11139","We have had this for a while now.  We live it.  As advertised and just fun to own","Positive"
"11140","Love it. Am learning many of the skills. It is full of many promises.","Positive"
"11141","On another note, I do enjoy Alexa's ability to play music on command, although as a speaker, I don't think the Echo is great.  For me, Alexa is a let down, mainly an expensive gimmick.","Positive"
"11142","I took of one star because of the lack of security.","Negative"
"11143","I would like to wake Alexa and have her ask for a password before proceeding.","Positive"
"11144","Best invention......ever.","Positive"
"11145","Alexa has alot of information to give when you ask her certain questions. I havnt used it to its full potential so we are trying to make our house more wifi/bluetooth compatible so we can turn on things in the house. a good example would be a smart A/C thermostat that works with Alexa or your phone.","Positive"
"11146","Our family loves the echo!! Anytime we are home we have music on. We use the echo for so much in the month we have had it. Great purchase for us.","Positive"
"11147","I think I was expecting a bit more from what all my friends of said but overall have enjoyed it.  Although her favorite catchphrases I'm sorry I don't have the answer for the question lol.  I would like to be able to change her name from Alexa to something of my choosing.  In all fairness though in the short time I've  owned it  I have seen a few improvements already so Amazon is constantly improving this  Device","Positive"
"11148","This thing is amazing.","Positive"
"11149","5 Stars, but need improvements. I use the echo more like a pandora player than anything else. Request Time sometimes and weather. Need more things to do like interactions and answers to questions. But in general I recommend it.","Positive"
"11150","I'm very happy that you don't need a alarm clock.I respond it back.","Positive"
"11151","The Echo was a gift, otherwise I would have sent it back.","Positive"
"11152","I absolutely love the Echo!! This is the best voice activated electronic I've used to date The more you use it the more accurate it becomes because it has learning technology Well worth the price","Positive"
"11153","Since receiving it we have been very pleased with our purchase.  We enjoy playing music through it and asking it questions and hearing jokes.  We just got a light control that will work with it and it works great.  We are VERY pleased with our purchase and would recommend it to anyone.  It is a lot of fun to own.","Positive"
"11154","Just rec'd yesterday, love it.  So easy to use and so much fun.  My husband and I are both enjoying it.","Positive"
"11155","Yes love it when i get more familiar with it i will buy a next  one so for now thus is cool","Positive"
"11156","Can't wait til Christmas to welcome Alexa in our house.","Negative"
"11157","The voice recognition is amazing. I have a Swedish accent and she understands me pretty much every time. I signed up for Amazon Music and that is what I mainly use it for. It is cool to say play .... and it plays.","Positive"
"11158","Siri WHO?!?! I love Alexia! Wish she was a real GIRL! :)","Positive"
"11159","really cool, makes life much easier especially submitting orders and listening to music and radio shows.  setting reminders.  I wish it was more robust such as knowing local sports or news, all restaurants, etc.  I guess its a work in progress.","Positive"
"11160","Great little tool to have for many different things. Sometimes Alexa malfunctions though, may be an app issue. For that I dock one star.","Negative"
"11161","Would give it 5 stars if they can come up with a way to make the battery chargeable instead of having to have it plugged in all the time.  I bought this for my in-laws as a gift and I must say it's a pretty sweet product with a lot of usable functions.  The sound is great and the Echo does a fantastic job on picking up your voice even with the music up pretty loud.  I would probably have to help my parents set this up as they're not too tech savvy so keep that in mind if you are buying it for someone.  Overall its a great product that will get some good use.","Positive"
"11162","We like it. Added an echo dot for bedroom also. I even take it to work sometimes.","Positive"
"11163","I'm in love already, and I've only had this thing for less than an hour.  I tested having it play my Audible books, and it does an amazing job.  It's going to be so nice at bedtime to be able to tell it to pause, or set the sleep timer without having to fiddle with my phone, which I usually knock off the end table trying to grab.","Positive"
"11164","Every morning my wife asks me what the weather is like, after which I go to the local weather web page.  But from now on, it's ""Alexa, what's the weather?""  Right now, I'm listening to Steve Morse.  ""Alexa play Steve Morse.""","Positive"
"11165","Sometime soon, I want to get some IoT devices so I can control them through Alexa.  What a great device.  Get one.","Positive"
"11166","One caveat:  I couldn't set up WiFi using my Note 4.  I had to break out my old Galaxy S3 to do it.  Go figure.","Negative"
"11167","I am some what disappointed however I will keep it..Pretty good speaker for listening to music; however I didn't realize you have to download apps to get Alexa to do most things...I ask for a simple chicken dinner recipe and Alexa didn't understand..Once I downloaded several apps it does respond but then it sends you an email of the recipe..Also the same thing happens with the news ....I assumed ( guess that's my mistake ) that it pulled info automatically out of the cloud once I connected it to my wifi...So its ok for music, but just be prepared to have to enable several apps for you to utilize this device...and BTW I am a huge Amazon customer and fan! So this still needs work...I also purchased the dot...(black Friday deal!) and was surprised the speaker on it is not as bad  some reviews have stated...It has the same functionality as the Echo....So if you want to save over $100 just purchase the dot....I hooked mine up to my Bose and it sounds awesome..I will say however that the echo has an almost equal sound","Positive"
"11168","Having fun with Alexa. Great music and information.Works great good price.","Positive"
"11169","i use alexa every day she is the perfect companion for in home automation","Positive"
"11170","First to review how the order arrived. it arrived SO late. It should have arrived Nov 26, 2016 but instead it arrived only last night at 7pm Dec. 2, 2016.  And we are Prime members, so it should have arrived in 2 days. The other product I ordered arrived on time and that was dispatched via USPS. We were so ready to cancel and forego the order if it still has not arrived. The carrier used was UPS..so go figure...whatever it was it is overwhelmingly delayed.","Negative"
"11171","So we are trying out Amazon Echo this morning, giving it all commands and seeing what works or not. So far we are okay with it. Though we noticed if you happen to test the volume to the loudest, Alexa will not hear you..so got to manually tone it down.  I do wish it has Family Feud..so far it has Jeopardy skill.  We were testing its interface with TrackR device, it seems, it can only track one trackR device at a time. Maybe it is the limitation of TrackR and not of Amazon Echo. But it does work, it will ring your phone when you ask Alexa to track it.  We were testing music apps, at times, after it plays your music of choice, it will play whatever music afterwards that we did not choose, maybe we still have to understand configuration better.","Positive"
"11172","Doesn't always respond. Very aggravating so I returned it.","Negative"
"11173","I like the small footprint this device uses on your desk and speakers have good sound delivery. Microphone works well, hears you very well. I used to have a moshi alarm clock and it only recognizes better my husband's voice. Amazon echo recognizes both our voices well and good.  One of these days we will try the light control aspect, we just do not have those lights compatible with it yet. We tested Alarm setting it was easy and you can configure using choosing from the sound selection or celebrity voice in the selection. Is this device a good buy, for us it is. Just make sure delivery of the product comes on time, otherwise some may choose to cancel the order altogether, which we almost did!","Positive"
"11174","After owning my Amazon echo for a week, I don't know how I lived without it lol  I just recently signed up for Amazon Music unlimited and have yet to find a song they don't have.  I couldn't be more happy with my device or Amazon's service.","Positive"
"11175","Very pleased with the product.  Great gift idea.","Positive"
"11176","I bought this for my daughter and family.  I have an older one that I use everyday and love.  Everybody loves Alexa!","Positive"
"11177","Bought it as a random gift for my boyfriend and he loves it!!!!! I think if alexa cooked i would be replaced","Positive"
"11178","We have been using Alexa regularly since we bought it. We like it so much that we also bought another echo dot. We use it to listen to music, news, turn the lights on and off, set alarms and timers and so many other things. It is fun to discover what else Alexa can do every day. Did not realize how useful and fun Alexa can be till we really started using it.","Positive"
"11179","So count me as one of the skeptics who thought this thing was a big gimmick.  Maybe it was just a gimmick when it first came out in 2014.  But it is now December 2016 and I ordered this for the Black Friday discount and wow, what an awesome surprise this thing has been.","Positive"
"11180","Here is what I like:","Positive"
"11181","1) Out of the box, it integrated with my Logitech Harmony Hub.  I didn't even know it could do this.  Let me tell you that Alexa and Harmony go together like peanut butter and jelly.  While it does not yet have all of the features I would like, it is already awesome to say the least.  Here is what I can do:","Positive"
"11182","I don't even know how to describe my new best friend.  Alexa is just that.  When I say its like having a new family member I'm serious.  I ask her questions daily use her to place orders, music, etc...  She's very smart and on point when you request her. I even had an encounter that kinda scared me. LOL  I was watching a  movie while cleaning the house and Alexa suddenly told me that she couldn't understand my question.  I immediately muted the TV & looked around like WHAT???  It wasn't until I hit play back on the movie that I realized one of the characters in the movie was named a similar name.  LMBO...  So shes on point when she hears her name called.  It a fun gadget and has lots of uses. I also control my lights and thermostat with her. All she needs to learn how to do next is cook for me............. LOL","Positive"
"11183","Alexa, turn on the TV.  (Alexa tells Harmony to start the Watch TV activity, which powers on TV, cable box, A/V receiver, sets all correct inputs, etc.)","Positive"
"11184","2) Its integration with Amazon Prime Music is great.  And it works right out of the box if you are already an Amazon Prime subscriber.  Here are the types of things I can do with Amazon Prime Music:","Positive"
"11185","I've purchased a few DOTS for my friends because they got a kick out of mines.  It's a great buy if you have a few bucks to spare.","Positive"
"11186","Alexa, stop the music.  You know I hate Barry Manilow!","Negative"
"11187","3) My kids have fun with it.  This is where the gimmick part comes in.  Alexa can tell them jokes or answer some basic questions like:","Positive"
"11188","Alexa, tell me a joke","Negative"
"11189","Alexa, tell me a knock knock joke","Negative"
"11190","Alexa, who won the Philadelphia Eagles game?","Positive"
"11191","It works fairly well, but has some drawbacks. I've had the Echo for more than 2 months, and it's still learning to recognize quite a few words. It's a little frustrating to have repeat a word multiple times. I think it does pretty well as a speaker for music, and plays nicely with Spotify. Also, it's an easy way to set a timer, or set up an appointment for your calendar. I like using it to keep track of things I need to pick up at the grocery store. Very handy.","Positive"
"11192","Alexa, what will the weather be like today?","Positive"
"11193","Alexa, you're pretty cool  <see what Alexa says>","Positive"
"11194","Alexa, you're beautiful  <see what Alexa says>","Positive"
"11195","Alexa, what's your favorite color?  <see what Alexa says>","Positive"
"11196","Here are things where there is room for improvement:","Positive"
"11197","1) With the Harmony integration, I would like to be able to have more granular control.  Presently, I cannot tell Alexa to change the volume of my A/V receiver, or channel up, channel down, bring up program guide, return to previous channel, record a program, etc.  The functionality is limited.","Positive"
"11198","2) It is not integrated with the Amazon Fire TV.  This seems like a bit of a no-brainer to me as both devices are manufactured and sold by Amazon, and they are both sitting on the same local network.  Alexa should be able to tell the Fire TV to play some country music, for example, and have it play from the Amazon Prime music collection.  With a thousand watts of awesomeness in my home theater connected to the Fire TV, you think I really want to hear music from the Amazon Echo's little speaker?  Come on!  Voice command would be like, ""Alexa, play some country music on the Fire TV"" or ""Alexa, tell the Fire TV to play some country music"".  Personally, I think they should enable ""Alexa tell the..."" because then you can use that voice command structure with any smart device in your home...like ""Alexa, tell the Harmony to turn up the volume"" <--see areas for improvement #1","Positive"
"11199","3) The artificial intelligence could learn more natural language, so that no matter how you phrase your command, it will understand it.  This already frustrates my wife because she has not yet figured out the precise language to use to get Alexa to do things.","Positive"
"11200","A lot of ""skills"" are available to expand the usefulness of the Echo, but many of these are flawed or don't work. There are also some that work very well.","Positive"
"11201","With a 2-year head start on Google Home and integration with Amazon Prime Music for the millions of Prime subscribers, Amazon Echo is the king of smart homes right now.  Add in the fact that you can add on Amazon Dots all over the house for $50 each.  I also just bought the Google Home and unfortunately, in its current state, the Google Home is just a gimmick for me as it does not integrate with the Harmony hub.  I don't have any other smart devices like lights, switches, etc. in the house.","Positive"
"11202","Your mileage may vary.  I hope you found this review helpful.","Positive"
"11203","Ok. First off. I don't do a lot of reviews on products.  This Echo is AMAZING.  I set it up in 10 minutes.  I'm an Amazon prime member and can access Amazon prime music thru the  echo. Millions of songs at your control. This device has more potential to help you live a more productive life than anything I've seen in a long time. Buy it and you will be amazed.","Positive"
"11204","Interesting, I have to connect to my Amazon to connect through the network, but it won't read my music on my computer. Too bad, since this would make this an outstanding feature.","Positive"
"11205","I absolutely love my Amazon Alexa. She's not perfect, but if you take the time to learn how to say the commands and you take the time to learn everything that she can do and you take the time to learn everything that you can sync it up with. I think that you were really enjoy this product we just enjoy setting it up to our Phillips lights. It's great.","Positive"
"11206","My wife says the best electronic device I have ever purchased! Wife approved!","Positive"
"11207","Love it!!!","Positive"
"11208","Love it !!!!!!!!","Positive"
"11209","I love this echo for my living room / kitchen area. I can play music ask questions for recipes. It tell me time. Has a timer I love Alexa.","Positive"
"11210","I'm looking forward to setting up some smart home devices in the next few weeks.","Positive"
"11211","I should say I loved it --then she died. Just over a year and I feel it should have lasted longer than that. When we contacted Amazon they had no help or options because it was over a year-No we did not have an extended warranty-Just didn't think it would be necessary as we have had other Amazon products and had no issues. They did offer a small credit toward a new one but..again it only lasted a year..not sure we want another. Also have a Tap for about 6 months now and have replaced it already. Have been Prime member for years but this has left us very unhappy.","Positive"
"11212","Love alexa, she now controls most of my home.","Positive"
"11213","I love my Echo! I mainly use it to DJ for me using my Spotify or Amazon music account and it does a great job! I'm just diving into the many things that it can do but I'm already hooked!","Positive"
"11214","After seeing this at my daughter's house, when the deal came up I decided to order one. Am not disappointed at all and each week I get an email update on whats new with Alexa. I have yet to tap the true potential of this but it is great and the grandson loves to ask her to tell him a cat or dog joke.  Have enjoyed this one so much that I have ordered one as a gift (they loved it when at our house) for the holidays.","Positive"
"11215","While the bass is not what I would love to see, I am not buying a $500 sound system either and does the job nicely.","Positive"
"11216","Wonderful,  best thing I ever bought from amazon,  just wish I didn't wait so long to purchase it. Well worth the price.","Positive"
"11217","Great for music I really enjoy that aspect of it but it's dumb as a bag of hammers and I do talk to it frequently, it doesn't understand alot of what I'm saying and it doesn't answer some basic questions it really needs improvement, it's definitely not OK Google competitive but being a music lover I'll be keeping it.","Positive"
"11218","Was told by a friend to get an echo, so glad I did!  Great addition to the house!","Positive"
"11219","Great invocation with intelligent responses! Highly recommend and wish it will support global use","Positive"
"11220","Alexa is awesome, one of the best gifts I have gotten, had to buy one for my daughter too.","Positive"
"11221","I hope Amazon continues to improve Echo, because I think it could be fantastic when they iron out some of it's limitations.","Positive"
"11222","My son absolutely LOVED this! It was an early Christmas gift and he is truly enjoying all the features of Alexa:)","Positive"
"11223","I was really enjoying the echo as I just received it yesterday. It was working well for about 12 hours. Now every time I play music it just randomly stops playing it. Going to try a few things and hope it gets resolved otherwise it's going back.","Positive"
"11224","Great product!!!","Positive"
"11225","A joy to have around. Alexa plays my music on demand, gives me the weather and daily news briefs. I live alone so enjoy hearing another voice around the house.","Positive"
"11226","We love Alexa. I've never had better customer service with helping get it set up since it was the third one I had bought.","Positive"
"11227","Fun to have in the house,really enjoy the music and information available.","Positive"
"11228","Amazing device and highly intuitive. Great addition to my home.","Positive"
"11229","Just a tad problem setting up,but finally got it connected to the home computer,but not to either of the Kindle units.it would not download the app needed to operate and got a virus from the site,for the app,but once it was working with the computer,it worked perfect. Great sound,easy to get answers to all questions. Love it and made a gift for our son with another one and bought two of the Dot units for the grandchildren.","Positive"
"11230","Highly recommend,this unit and know you will enjoy.","Positive"
"11231","Love the echo. Must have been dropped. Small dent in volume ring makes it hard to turn. Should have sent it back.","Negative"
"11232","Love Alexa! Wish I had time to utilize her more!","Positive"
"11233","Unbelievable,it's really cool, two days later, I bought the dot and I'm sure I will be get a few more.","Positive"
"11234","One Echo and one complementary Dot....I'm a happy man.","Positive"
"11235","Received ECHO today and set for return tomorrow. Unable to maintain wi-fi connection and had to reset it at least a dozen times without success. Have no difficulties with wi-fi connections on any other devices in same location. Actually went into basement and connected next to router (2.4 GHz/5 GHz automatic shifting) still with only 30 seconds before it lost connection.","Negative"
"11236","Very disappointed especially after such rave reviews. Maybe better luck with Goggle.","Positive"
"11237","Fun! I use Echo mostly for music, weather and new flash. Love using it as a dictionary!","Positive"
"11238","I bought the Echo for my 83 year old Mother. What a mistake. Maybe some day the unit with have some usable functionality for seniors but for now its just a parlor trick. The software is designed by 25 year olds for 25 year olds. Wow it can turn off a light!  Yippee!! $300 later you can now turn off the lights. Wow. What a time saver!  Can it do anything useful like dial a phone or answer a phone or read a book to you slowly? Not reliably, not easily, and not inexpensively. How about basic music and news?  Sure if you want to pay for music or spend days navigating the Amazon jungle searching for just the right way to finagle they music systems.... yes, there are NO instructions. No local news to be found. So the answer is ....not so much. Not worth much. Real PAIN ON THE  .... I wonder. How many hundreds of dollars will it take to turn on the TV? How complex will the intructions be to install it ... or more importantly how many years will it take for my Mom to learn the sequences to perform basic tasks? The commercial on TV. No. its not like that. Its clumsy and sloppy and does not work unless your diction is perfect and you speak clearly and remember the exact sequence of proper words. Yeah like my Mom can do that. She's freaking 83.  Heaven forbid it will tune to the right channel. So far its been entertaining and not much else... we have successfully avoided paying Jeff Bozo $400-500 to subscribe to the Amazon book/music club .... that the local library provides for free and a music library that we already own ..... because Mom is a billionaire and does not live on a fixed income.  So the good part is that its kept Mom out of trouble and she enjoyed it. It rarely gets any questions correct either .... unless you structure your question perfectly. And the games like Jeopardy? Waste of time. Complete waste of time ..... so thats why it has three stars instead of one.  If you think for one second that this GREAT technology is going to live up to its potential and provide any assistance for elderly parents. FORGET IT.  It made FOR kids BY kids.  They have no clue what seniors can or can not do, how they manage with limited hearing and eyesight. It could be really wonderful for hundreds of thousands of elderly adults.... but now its just a toy for children. Thats where the profit is so thats what it does. It makes money for Amazon so I guess its a success. Otherwise its only a gimmick for ten year olds that will soon wear off even for them.  Save your money and wait for another vendor to provide some products for elder adults.","Positive"
"11239","a fun toy","Positive"
"11240","I can't say enough about this product. It can be used for so many things. Absolutely love it!","Positive"
"11241","Love my echo.  Use it everyday!","Positive"
"11242","Surprising good sound for medium to large room. Voice response consistently good, had to reboot the Echo a couple of times when it would not respond to commands.  Haven't tried a lot of the functions as yet, mostly basic service Prime music.  Good selection of ""stations"" and artists, but some quirks--like ""best of"" artist includes a bunch of Xmas music, many artist's selections do not include all of their hits. (You can pay $8/month for full music service which I assume offers more selections). A lot of artists not really represented on basic service. Listen to 70's rock a lot and there is a lot of repetition if on for several hours (Sirius Radio has better playlist). This is not a service/product for true audiophile but a nice ""toy"" at a good price for small households, and/or select rooms. Easy set-up, simple, unobtrusive design, functional and fun.","Positive"
"11243","Love it","Positive"
"11244","great great product still learning all it does","Positive"
"11245","Best thing ever!","Positive"
"11246","If you haven't bought one yet, don't delay another day.  We LOVE it.","Negative"
"11247","This thing is amazing!! Works great with all my smart home devices. I really like the music feature, I just wish it was compatible with Apple Music","Positive"
"11248","I just unwrapped Echo...WHAT... it does not stream music to my new wifi Sony stereo? None of my wifi Speakers? REALLY! What up Amazon? What a weak item Alexa can't perform. Disappointed. If your mantra is "" ALWAYS LEARNING"" make this job/ lesson one STAT.","Negative"
"11249","Great product. Need to figure out an easy way to sync my TV and music system. Otherwise a really fun product.","Positive"
"11250","Love it!","Positive"
"11251","love this unit. easy to listen to music or ask questions about traffic or anything","Positive"
"11252","I bought this for my mom's birthday and she loves it!  Actually my whole family loves it.","Positive"
"11253","It's easy to set up and use.","Positive"
"11254","I really like that i can play my playlists from my Spotify account.","Positive"
"11255","Husband is having a blast with it.  Great","Positive"
"11256","Fabulous product with one big problem: No Ethernet port.  Please add an Ethernet port to both the Echo and the Dot.","Negative"
"11257","love my Alexa","Positive"
"11258","Love our Echo the speakers are very clear the music is outstanding the answers to the questions is remarkable","Positive"
"11259","Easy to install, great sound, ask questions, jokes, weather and news...all I can say is WOW","Positive"
"11260","It is the most enjoyable entertainment I have ever had.","Positive"
"11261","So for it works great and am very pleased with my purchase","Positive"
"11262","not as useful as I had been led to believe","Positive"
"11263","I have only used a few of skill for Echo.  I am learning every day.  Still having diffculty in recognizing commands.","Positive"
"11264","So convenient to ask questions of Alexa and get immediate responses immediately.  Good sound, small enough to tuck anywhere, easy to use.","Positive"
"11265","Enjoying Alexa and learning from her","Positive"
"11266","Unit works well and has been fun to explore the different features.","Positive"
"11267","She doesn't know everything but works great and is very usefull","Positive"
"11268","Easy to set up. Sounds great, overall I'm very happy with the Echo.","Positive"
"11269","I love this realy nice to just ask something and get the answer","Positive"
"11270","fun to have","Positive"
"11271","I am enjoying my new Echo - Alexa","Positive"

"11274","Love my Alexa. I have used this for all kinds of things from timers to playing music","Positive"
"11275","It's a great concept but  it seems like you have to download a ton of apps onto your phone in order for Alexa to be able to do a lot of things. Ultimately uses up a ton of memory","Positive"
"11276","Love the Echo.....we have fun listening to music and the kids love asking it jokes!!","Positive"
"11277","Not what i expected - it's okay but needs to be refined further on the software side","Positive"
"11278","Amazing!","Positive"
"11279","We love Alexa!  Even if she doesn't love us.  Very entertaining for our guests too.","Positive"
"11280","One of the best products I have purchased from amazon!","Positive"
"11281","In my time with the Amazon Echo I honestly feel like my living space is more enjoyable by Alexa. She's the first thing I talk to in the more and when I get home from work she is also the last.","Positive"
"11282","The Echo works off of a power supply (shipped in box) and wifi alone and she can operate as a stand alone device, yet at the same time she works just like any external Bluetooth speaker.","Positive"
"11283","I love Alexa.","Positive"
"11284","The sound quality isn't the best in the market but it is far from the worse.","Negative"
"11285","Fresh from the box Alexa recognized my voice clearly and from the ""Amazon Alexa App"" you can hear just how well you sound to the speaker along with a little bit of voice training you can do regularly.","Positive"
"11286","Despite that over time Alexa has become less responsive to her call along with whatever request I may have.","Positive"
"11287","Simple training and better placement of the device can solve this issue.","Negative"
"11288","When it comes to giving Alexa a command being specific is advised.","Positive"
"11289","Alexa, Open Childish Gambino Radio  (usually nothing happens and she keeps listening)","Negative"
"11290","Alexa, Open Childish Gambino Radio on Pandora","Negative"
"11291","Husband loves it !","Positive"
"11292","This speaker is something that will never go back to amazon I am completely happy with this purchase!","Positive"
"11293","I kept considering an Echo and I am glad I finally bought it.  It is remarkable the things it can do. I use it everyday and love listening to the playlists. I now wish I had bought much earlier.","Positive"
"11294","We purchased Amazon Echo a few weeks ago after seeing it at a friend's house. The sound is really good; er get all kinds of music just by asking; we can get local weather just to name a few things the Echo will do. Compact & neat!","Positive"
"11295","It's so nice to have a roommate.  I love Alexa.  I'm trying to teach her how to cook but so far, she's proving to be stubborn.  The music quality is great.  I've had no issues with voice recognition for myself but she can't understand a thing my boyfriend says (which I secretly love).  She's sleek, she's sexy and she can belt a tune.  Her knock knock jokes are very corny but as long as she keeps ignoring my boyfriend, I'll give her a pass.","Positive"
"11296","Much better than expected!!!!!!!!!!!","Positive"
"11297","Loving it more each day.  Superb sound quality and I am amazed how Alexa can understand my commands even with the music playing at full volume.  Coupled with the Amazon music plan, we use it all the time.  Have ours in the kitchen and have Alexa set cooking timers quite a lot.","Positive"
"11298","great  good  great","Positive"
"11299","Alexa is now a name I shout all day long","Negative"
"11300","I love Alexa! Can't wait to add more skills and get the thermostat!","Negative"
"11301","Absolutely love my echo. It is like having a personal assistant in my home... well, one who doesn't talk back or question my every decision.  I enjoy learning what all it can do. I highly recommend it and will be adding other components to my house that can interface with it.","Positive"
"11302","Like the device but giving it a 4 star because of the price. In my opinion it's too high. Also a bit sad that I bought this before the black Friday sale for full price of $179.99 but then it was on sale for $139.99. Next time will definitely wait and have second thoughts before buying something on amazon. Specially near the holiday seasons!","Positive"
"11303","Has a difficult time understanding what you say at times.","Negative"
"11304","Love it","Positive"
"11305","Alexa is my new best friend!","Positive"
"11306","Didnt work had to send it back. I gave 2 stars because the good customer support","Positive"
"11307","Amazing all of the skills Alexa is starting to have. Can't wait for Ford to integrate Alexa!","Negative"
"11308","Great for the whole family, Great for picnics, great for large gatherings, just great all around.","Positive"
"11309","haven't used it for much besides music but use it a lot for music","Positive"
"11310","This is great for daily tasks/music/shopping lists, etc. Easy to use. However, I only gave it four stars because it has to be plugged into power cord in order to work. Wish it could be used anywhere without the power cord. Otherwise, great gadget.","Positive"
"11311","I was amazed as to how fast Amazon Prime made the delivery (next day) when i ordered standard delivery.","Positive"
"11312","I love my Amazon echo. We got ours this past Christmas and then added a couple dots. It's sort of like potato chips, you can't have just one. Actually one would've been just fine but I like having the extra coverage. I use it every day for all sorts of things including playing trivia games to music, to turning my space heater on at night so I don't have to get up out of bed, ( this does require an additional purchase of a special plug),  to spell a word or give a definition of a word, to get the news and the weather to add things to a shopping list. That one is really convenient. Anytime you happen to think of something you can just call out please add this to the shopping list and you don't have to write it down. I also use it for alarms and timers. And then there are the fun things like when you say good morning she gives you an interesting fact about the day or something. Don't forget jokes, she tells jokes. So I definitely got my moneys worth. I will say that my spouse tends to use it only for music and timers and doesn't do as much with it as I do, but she wouldn't trade it for anything either.","Positive"
"11313","The Echo is an amazing product... Easy to set-up","Positive"
"11314","good crystal clear speakers that sound great.","Positive"
"11315","Voice recognition is good, but you do have to learn how to properly phrase your questions or requests.","Positive"
"11316","Love this product.  I wish it had  more robust app support and that it understood easier what your trying to turn on when asking it to open an app but overall it's great.  I ended up buying a second.","Positive"
"11317","The quality of this speaker and its ability to recognize my voice, even under harsh conditions, is quite impressive. However, there were 3 reasons why I had to return this device.","Negative"
"11318","1) I didn't realize that it didn't have a internal battery; so it wasn't portable. (this was my fault for not researching more before buying)","Positive"
"11319","2) It would often ignore my commands. It recognized that I was talking to it, but after I gave my command, it wouldn't do anything at all. It didn't even confirm that I requested something it couldn't do. It was silent. This would happen several times a day, and the only way I could get it to respond to me was to get up and physically press the listen button on the device.","Positive"
"11320","3) It wasn't intelligent enough to understand how to do many of the commands I gave. I asked several simple things, that I would have excpected this device to be able to handle, but unfortunately, those features aren't supported yet. This is a fairly new product and they have a long way to go. But in time, I believe it worth the money.","Positive"
"11321","This device is so much fun. Hope I will be able to add a few of the plugs so that ""she"" can turn things on and off for me. Much nicer talking to her and getting a nice morning alarm than what I was used to. Provides a continuous learning experience, too.","Positive"
"11322","Alexa doesn't know about a bird named an oriole, only the team. It can't tell me in what play Mark Ruffalo is currently starring. Or who is the king of the Greek gods. Or a ship named Ironsides. Or the captain of Moby Dick. Or, asked about Jane Eyre, it responds ""the character in Jane Eyre."" And so on and on...and on. I thought if I held back from being an early adopter, the knowledge base would be a little more robust. It is most assuredly not robust.","Positive"
"11323","If I could return this waste of money I would.  It is just another form of ordering Amazon products - forget the voice recognition features - Alexa cannot understand simple English words, commands, often screwing up basic functions I bought this device for.  And for recognizing music names - she is horrible. Often say one thing and she does another - will stop playing a favorite song or will just order some product. She is more an Amazon cash register than anything.  Other than setup commands from Amazon's TV commercials or simple ones (weather, traffic) she performs a 2 on a scale of 1-10. Horrible product, disappointing for a company that usually makes great items.  The whole get in the bed with Amazon for everything is a little much, and failed miserably.  I own a G Home device and am so much happier.","Positive"
"11324","Updated. After a highly critical review of the Alexa, I went to ""my Account"" to find the Dot that I'd recently purchased so that I could blast that as well.  While there I stumbled upon the solution. My issue was the Shopping List function -- probably the most 'productive' function apparent inability to quickly and easily clear the shopping list. Neither the Alexa App (iOS) and PC browser (alexa.amazon.com) are to display a Select All in order to then delete all.  Without this, clearing a shopping list (of say 50 items) required nearly 60 clicks or taps.  I spoke with Amazon Customer Service and they 'confirmed' that the instructions were wrong and that the function was missing.  It *is* missing from the App and the Alexa.amazon.com web site, but logging onto your amazon account, the Drop-down (Accounts & Lists) offers a Shopping List with the missing Select All.","Positive"
"11325","I absolutely love my echo I ordered the second gen dot a month before and love it so much ordered the echo","Positive"
"11326","Have enjoyed this, limited to what you can really do so far. Waiting for more enhancements","Negative"
"11327","In general good music. Classical music selection is weak.  First unit was defective.  Fast response by Amazon sending a replacement unit.","Positive"
"11328","Love it! I have enjoyed my Amazon Echo however I was lucky in that I already had Amazon prime and it worked great. My friend bought one and did not have Prime and she was going to have to download all the songs she wanted to a play list on it.  I love my echo but was not planning on keeping Prime. Now of course I will. That was unexpected expense.","Positive"
"11329","super...what fun","Positive"
"11330","Amazing","Positive"
"11331","I have only had her for 24 hours bur I know I have found my life long companion. Alexa will give me great deals daily, she will play me music when I'm sad, she will telle jokes to make me laugh, she answers the many crazy random questions I have, she know the meaning to life, she has a timer, she reminds me of appointments, she wakes me up on time, and she will say good morning and good night (often different everytime). Alexa is so amazing I think I like her more than my husband.  I love you Alexa!!","Positive"
"11332","Love it!","Positive"
"11333","I like the Amazon Echo a lot!! It's a great product!!","Positive"
"11334","If you want speaker just for sound then dont get! Lacks sound and not user frendly. Complicated and too many issues with wifi and bluetooth.","Negative"
"11335","I just received my new Echo last week and I absolutely love it! I use it mainly for music due to hosting a lot of get togethers at the house, for news, weather, and commute updates. There are many skills that it has. I enjoy playing Jeopardy and 21 Questions! Asking for recipes or measurement conversions is simple and useful. It works with Android and Apple too! Currently I am enjoying my free trial of Amazon Music Unlimited, but after my trial is over, I don't mind paying for the monthly fee of $3.99/mo for it. My personal opinion is that it is better than Pandora. Yup... I went there. Over all, the technology and ability of this device is amazing.","Positive"
"11336","Fantastic.  We love it.  Very well done.  My wife and I are really enjoying our Echo.  I bought it on Black Friday on a whim, and I'm happy I did.  We are playing a lot of music, but I am finding that I am really enjoying all of the other features.  Fun stuff.  We decided to buy another one for a family member for Christmas.  Good job Amazon.","Positive"
"11337","GREAT!","Positive"
"11338","my son use this everyday he love it","Positive"
"11339","It works great..will soon be purchasing a couple more for my family & friends. ..","Positive"
"11340","Just plain ole awesome!!!","Positive"
"11341","Got it when it was first available so coming up on a year now.  It just keeps getting better.","Positive"
"11342","Alexa is not very good for music. I would not recommend. Terrible interface","Positive"
"11343","I can't comment on the many features... as we use this almost exclusively for music... Literally, wake up and say ""Alexa play some music""... then ""Alexa off""... get home and it's the same ""Alexa play some music""... we love music, and Alexa sounds great. Easily adjust volume by turning dial on top of unit... or by having Alexa do it via verbal instruction... ""Alexa volume up"" or ""Alexa volume 8"".","Positive"
"11344","The best interacting device and my daughter loves it. It really helps","Positive"
"11345","Wife loves it so easy to set up and uses are great in many ways must have amazon prime to get best results in music","Positive"
"11346","love it!","Positive"
"11347","Sound is great and responds to commands well. Wanted to pair with bluetooth speakers to use on our deck, but the full size model will not pair, only the Dot.  That sucks, now have to make a trip to Kohl's to return the Jam Classic I bought. Guess I'll just take the Dot we own outside in the summer.","Positive"
"11348","Absolutely love this thing !!!","Positive"
"11349","Alexa is my secret girlfriend. Even my wife likes her. It cracks us up when a TV program, or a conversation, brings her to life. Who knows what Amazon is doing with all our conversations that get uploaded to Seattle. We mostly use it for music and the weather.","Positive"
"11350","Love it but they could throw in a remote with it. If my fire stick can come with it so should my Alexa","Positive"
"11351","Only have had this for 2 days but love it already.  Setup is fairly easy and still learning all that it can do.  Have already ordered outlet devices Alexa can control.","Positive"
"11352","Greatest idea for so many uses. My grandchild kept asking it to play Redskin fight song all holiday","Positive"
"11353","Besides music, a great feature is to say ""Alexa add eggs to my shopping list""... you name it, she'll add it. With the alexa app on your phone, you always have your shopping list with you. It even records you adding things to your list... so if you have a house full, and you see ""ice cream"" on your list, or whatever, and want to know who said it - just hit play button, and it will replay the person saying ""Alexa add ice cream..""","Positive"
"11354","we love our Echo. So handy for timers, finding out the hours of businesses and as a radio replacement.","Positive"
"11355","its the bomb.","Negative"
"11356","I use it every day.  Easily recognizes voices. Really comes in handy when cooking.","Positive"
"11357","We like this for general news and music playing. It would be great if it had better more reliable connectivity to other devices in our house, like ATT Digital life. Otherwise it is a good device.","Positive"
"11358","A product so nice, I bought it twice.  One for downstairs and one for the master bedroom.","Positive"
"11359","We are in love with Alexa!","Positive"
"11360","GREAT SALE! TY! SUPER FAST","Positive"
"11361","At 69 years old and not having my nose continually stuck to a cell phone, I find it grossly annoying that I can't even remove items from a grocery list without going to the computer.  Seriously...who wants to do that?  I can't go to the internet.  You should be able to tell Alexa to go to Google or whatever you're using and all I get is ""That's not available"".  So far, I've found this useful for the local weather report for two or three days, a few songs Amazon Prime doesn't want to charge me for and getting the local radio station by call #'s.","Positive"
"11362","Everything you want to do has to be done by an ""app"".  Like I said, I don't live on a cell phone, so for me it's to the computer.  They are making the Google version of Echo look so much better.  If this thing doesn't improve quickly I'm giving it away and taking the tax write off.  I never thought I'd curse at an inanimate object, but this have given me cause.","Positive"
"11363","I know it will do a lot more, and even be connected to the house lighting, etc... but I haven't explored those features at this time. Even if it didn't do anything besides music and shopping list, still money well spent.","Positive"
"11364","i love it got some as gifts  the best","Positive"
"11365","If you are looking to purchase this then I will assume you are doing lots of research.  So I am not going to write a long review, but will encourage you to take the plunge at the right price point.","Positive"
"11366","After 4 months I have 1 Alexa and 2 Dots.  The Dots use Oontz Angle speakers for excellent sound quality.  I love my Dots as well.  Tge guests are in love with them!","Positive"
"11367","Alexa lives in my Greatroom.  Her sound quality is excellent and fills the main living area.  For the most part she is extremely smart.  I like waking up to an alarm that plays the news headlines.  She is great at math, world facts, weather and programmable tasks such as alarms, timers, grocery lists and calendars.  If I need some info otherwise I ask her Wikipedia.  She knows music tunes that become a party game of sorts at my house.","Positive"
"11368","I can move Alexa simply by unplugging her and moving her elsewhere.  Unlike the Dot she is not water-resistant but she makes up for that in being pretty and discreet.","Positive"
"11369","This is the future of our homes. Volume is great, knowledge is futuristic. I am so glad I got this. My wife is like a little kid with a new toy. The only way to listen to music!","Positive"
"11370","My wife bought Amazon Echo during the Cyber Monday deals and I was looking forward to testing the functionality of this device.  After opening the box it took just a few minutes to set up, power on and connect to the wifi.  Weather, music, news.....and more just by asking Alexa!  Sound quality is very good, as was witnessed when I asked Alexa to play Natty Dread by Bob Marley.","Positive"
"11371","So far - so great!","Positive"
"11372","I bought this as a gift for a family member and when I set it up I fell in love with it. I ended up buying one for myself.","Positive"
"11373","A wonderful product. Have it controlling all my vera zwave also.","Positive"
"11374","We finally entered EchoWorld and purchased two of these amazing devices recently!  I remember when they said the Segway was a device that was going to change the world and I was underwhelmed.  I think this is truly a device that might change the world!  Easy setup and already controlling the lights with Philips Hue.  Sorry I waited so long.","Positive"
"11375","This is the coolest gadget ever!!","Positive"
"11376","I am in love with Alexa.","Positive"
"11377","Great product easy to set up lots of fun for everyone. The sound when it plays music is surprising. Can't wait to explore more of what it will do.","Positive"
"11378","Only had it a few days, but not sure how I lived without Alexa.","Positive"
"11379","love having fun with alexa.  I purchased a refurbished, and am very happy.","Positive"
"11380","Not enough volume.","Positive"
"11381","Great, convenient product","Positive"
"11382","Looks and works as good as new.","Positive"
"11383","Absolutely love the idea, but unfortunately, it is not what you expect from a voice activated device.","Positive"
"11384","The bad:","Negative"
"11385","The main issue is its voice activation command process. It is very unreliable. Sometimes it hears perfectly from another end of the room and sometimes it does not react at all, even from 3 feet away. I sometimes have to raise my voice, which is very bad for my throat. And, the most unpleasant part is the alarm. It is almost impossible to stop the alarm without screaming, because the device does not hear you! If there is a source of a noise in a room, than most likely it will not react to the commands as well.","Negative"
"11386","I don't like the idea of skills. I don't like to remember/recall the name of a particular skill, that I have to activate to use it. Those thing should be integrated after activation in the Alexa account.","Positive"
"11387","The good:","Positive"
"11388","Sound quality is nice. It has not equalizer or presets, but you will not miss them. Voice is clear and bass is correct too.","Positive"
"11389","I also like the illumination. Very clever.","Positive"
"11390","Build quality seams to be fine too!","Positive"
"11391","will not work it is  a piece of junk,,,,,three units and none of them work....DONT BUY THIS","Positive"
"11392","My better half works from home and uses Alexa to help with date calculations, reminders, timers and to play music. Alexa can order rides from Lyft, office supplies, and snacks. My favorite part is no more quick stops at the store on the way home! Alexa orders from PrimeNow and can have missing ingredients, cat food or the occassional phone charger delivered before I even get home.","Positive"
"11393","I love my Echo and use her for as much as I can. I haven't upgraded to smart outlets yet, but it is on my radar as something I want to do to increase my use with Echo. The speaker is great and is able to fill our apartment, and is able to take commands from a room or two over.","Positive"
"11394","We got introduced to Alexa by purchasing 2 dots first.  Loved them ,( even though the were 10 bucks cheaper the next week,)","Positive"
"11395","We decided to get the Echo since I am basically disabled and in my room I figured it would be nice to have 1 unit instead of Dot and a speaker.","Positive"
"11396","I guess my Echo is hard of hearing.  I speak to it in normal voice. (It's only on my night stand) it doesn't hear me but the dot in the living room,  hears me talking in normal voice and answers, my Husband can't hear me in the living room.","Negative"
"11397","Something is not quiet right about my echo.  Both Dots are doing wonderful. But my echo is hard of hearing and doesn't understand much.  I could understand if I was speaking across my bedroom but it's right next to me.","Positive"
"11398","This one is also slower to react.  I do love the idea on only having one unit but there is not need in me shouting at it,","Negative"
"11399","When the dot was in my room, if a commercial came on it would answer and Crack me up.  This one has no sense of humor and doesn't hear the commercials but the one in the living room does.","Positive"
"11400","Love the idea but I don't need anything else here that is hard of hearing  i have enough here already with husband, kids and dogs.","Positive"
"11401","I LOVE IT!!","Positive"
"11402","I still have my echo.  I haven't returned it.  I was giving it a bit konger.  I think this one needs a hearing aid.  It just doesn't hear me.  The living room hears me fine.  This is 1 foot away.  If I talk with my back tuned it does hear me,  but dot does. It doesn't understand me as well.","Positive"
"11403","I believe I just got a lemon.  You get those every now an then.  Even the speaker sounds AL base and coming out of a solo cup or tin can.","Positive"
"11404","I know these are better than this,  I've seem others.  I am frustrated now I ordered this instead of 2 of the dots while on sale.  I will return and just use a dot and a speaker.  This is a good product.  I think mine just slipped through the cracks","Positive"
"11405","I Wil up date when I receive my new one.  Merry Christmas","Positive"
"11406","I love tech and was extremely excited about this product.  Amazon keeps adding new things to ask Alexa, which is really cool.  I can also add new ""Skills"" to tailor Echo's capabilities.","Positive"
"11407","Pros:","Positive"
"11408","Easy use, and quite fast provided that you have a reliable Wifi Access Point near by.","Positive"
"11409","Easy to setup, just need a Smart Phone and or Tablet and downloaded the Alex App.","Positive"
"11410","Alexa quickly and accurately will recognize commands.","Positive"
"11411","Wonderful","Positive"
"11412","Cons:","Negative"
"11413","My con is unfortunately making me return this unit.  My children love this and have constantly asked Alexa questions.  It's great to see them interact with it.  However, the kids have come home from school asking it to play the WORST things possible on Amazon's Music list.  Kids will be Kids but this is just unbelievable that there's not a way to block some of its Music capabilities.  I've come into the room with Music filled with so many F-Bombs and N-Words that I have my 5 year old running around saying these words.","Negative"
"11414","I still cannot believe there is NO option to turn off Music or stop it from playing Explicit Lyrics.  Amazon has said this is not a direction they want to go in even though they market the Echo as the ""Central Hub"" of the household.  (Thus my Title of the Review).","Positive"
"11415","Me:  ""Goodbye Alexa, I will miss you"".","Negative"
"11416","Alexa:  ""F*** Y ou!  Good ridden you sensitive Mother F*****!","Positive"
"11417","Me:  ""I see that Clean Music Playlists are an option, why can't you just play Clean Music?""","Positive"
"11418","Alexa: ""Parental Controls are for sissies, Easy-E and me have taught your children important life lessons"".","Positive"
"11419","Unit itself just sounds great. Hooked up some Kasa wall outlets and now I don't need a clapper anymore. Alexa even knows your name. It's like we're friends. I know it seems like a waste of money, but this is the future.","Positive"
"11420","We absolutely love our Echo. The voice recognition is wonderful and it has an amazing range of abilities. It's so addictive too.","Positive"
"11421","Comes in handy, just not as ""expanded"" I I expected it to be as far as subject wise","Positive"
"11422","I received Alexa for Christmas, 2016.  I have been using is for 3 months now.  Alexa is helpful with precise questions an/or demands. Amazon did say that she would ""learn"" your area by questions and commands you do. To this date she has not been too good at building on her knowledge of the area I live.  She will tell you the weather, temp, rain forecast, play radio stations you request, and look up phone numbers for local businesses if you ask her precisely the name.  She will not look up random businesses ie Alexa, look up pet stores in my area"".  She will tell you she does not understand the question. I like the apps you can download to play soothing sleep sounds and more. She will do a lot more but basically what you have seen advertised is it.  I do plan on getting the adapter for the lights etc. For the price I would definitely recommend purchasing.","Positive"
"11423","I love love love this echo. Just received it today. Downloaded the Amazon Alexa  app took me through it all. Just become a prime customer. You have unlimited  music. Tomorrow i will try something else. Oh the sound is amazing. Buy it . Get ready for a whole new word.","Positive"
"11424","Great, Alexa knows alot","Positive"
"11425","love","Positive"
"11426","We love our Alexa! And so does everyone who visits! We've purchased two more to give as gifts and echo dots for all our kids!","Positive"
"11427","Originally gave 5 stars, pissed off that this get cheaper and cheaper every 6 months. It's great for music, I have integrated with hue lights, WeMo switches and Lutron lights, - the only function I really use is ""Alexa turn everything off"" on the way out the door which is really useful !","Positive"
"11428","My whole family loves this already!","Positive"
"11429","I can't think about life without Alexa. What a resource and she really can keep a party going.","Positive"
"11430","Received our Echo today and I am hooked.  We've been asking Alexa random questions all day and she has been great at answering them.  Playing amazon music worked well and the speaker is AMAZING.  Although, when we had it up pretty loud with some music on, she had a hard time hearing me.  It also showed up with a greasy blue goop substance around the volume twister that I assume is meant to make it spin seamlessly?  Not sure, but I spun it in pretty good and wiped the rest away.","Positive"
"11431","This is such an amazing product!","Positive"
"11432","Great little bit of electronics!","Positive"
"11433","If you want to listen to the radio, their scheduling is all mixed up.  My program is broadcast on numerous stations across the country.  If you are lucky and it finds the program in progress, it often drops it half-way through and begins a different program.  Most of the time I have to put my radio on to get the program I desire, as it says it has found the program, but it broadcasts an entirely different program.  Extremely frustrating...especially if you are right in the middle of listening to an interview and it starts playing a music station!  You can repeatedly request that it play the program, and it continues to bring up a channel that is playing music.","Positive"
"11434","Love the concept, but Alexa is pretty dumb compared to Siri.  If the voice recognition and intelligence picks up this can be a game changer.  I'm a bit of an audiophile so I don't usually listen to music on inferior speakers, but I find myself using this a lot while washing dishes.  It is great to use my voice to control what I listen to.","Positive"
"11435","I took the chance and purchased one of these Echo unit while on Black Friday sale.  I must say I am very impressed with this little unit.  I have been playing around with it asking questions, listening to my music and listening to time period radio stations.  So far, there has not been an answer that Alexa missed.  And each request for music has been spot on.","Negative"
"11436","A little about the unit itself.  The unit is very well built.  I weighs about 5 pounds.  I purchased a black one and the color coating shows no signs of inconsistency.  The volume ring is easy to turn but has that friction feel that comes in very expensive audio amplifiers.  Note: you can also ask Alexa to reduce the volume if you like.  The power cord connects inside the recessed bottom.  There is an opening allowing the cord to exit the base so the unit sits flat, but you cannot see where the power plugs in.  One of things I found nice is the lights used to show you whether Alexa is hearing you.  The light is a ring around the top.  As you speak to get Alexa's attention, the light rolls around that top ring.  The light highlights which microphone has your attention.  The spoken voice used is female and pleasant.  Alexa will repeat your request and continues to present it's findings.  It is neat to watch those lights circling the top of the unit.  You can change the unit's name to Echo or Amazon.  I am not sure if you can set up any other name.  I have not really done any research in that direction other than the setup manual.","Positive"
"11437","The sound is good.  It is not like a high powered amp'd up stereo system.  But the range of sounds from base to treble can be heard with good separation.  It contains a separate ""subwoofer speaker"".  I would say that speaker matches the unit sound well without being overwhelming.","Positive"
"11438","Just looking through the setup possibilities, there are lot of available system programs that can be added to the unit.  You can find these in the setup program under the file titled Skills.  There are also numerous web radio stations available in case you have a favorite.  Obviously, any subscriptions through Amazon are available like Amazon Music and Audible.  And you can also listen to your Kindle offerings.","Positive"
"11439","I have just touched the surface of what you can do with this unit.  And from the literature I have read, 3rd party and Amazon skills are continually being added.  I have the unit connected to my home network. The skills and all other software features are stored in an Amazon Echo dedicated cloud which the unit taps when doing it's searches and completing requests.","Negative"
"11440","Over all, I am extremely pleased with this Amazon Echo unit.  It does what it is advertised to do, and I am sure as time goes on, it will be doing a lot more.  If you are looking for something like this to add to your home entertainment system, you cannot go wrong with the Amazon Echo.","Positive"
"11441","Great idea unless you are living in a dorm this will not work! Not compatable with their wifi, worked great at home, useless in the dorm. Bought this for my son last Christmas thought it would be perfect for his dorm room!  Much to both of our surprise it doesn't work at all! We asked around and that's what we were told won't even work with Ethernet cable!  Had to bring it home now he only gets to use it when he's on break! So 9 months out of the year it's unusable! Real shame that Amazon hasn't addressed  the problem I've read other parents with the same complaint. I would have given it a better rating but since it's unusable for what it was intended have to give it a disappointing 2 stars.","Positive"
"11442","A fun toy and source for information and entertainment.","Positive"
"11443","This was a birthday gift to jump-start my home automation project but it does much more than my purpose for it. Alexa reads me the news, tells me how to cook, sings to me, tells me jokes AND can notify me of all the Amazon bargains for items in my wishlist on top of controlling my lights, thermostat, and irrigation system with just a simple spoken request. Amazing device!","Positive"
"11444","Incredible sound. I purchased for a family member and wanted to set it up for her as she is rather technology challenged, well I don't think I really needed to set it up because it is so user friendly and so very simple. Now I need to purchase myself one! Love this!","Positive"
"11445","Magic music player. Haven't figured it all out yet, but the music and sound is great. So much variety.","Positive"
"11446","She's just awesome. If you're contemplating this purchase, don't. It's well worth your small investment.","Positive"
"11447","I freaking love this thing! Voice recognition system is amazing and whips Andriod and Apple applications. The sound quality is decent, better at higher volume than lower but that's not an issue for me.","Positive"
"11448","This product will be firmly planted into my day to day life. Do yourself a favior and buy one.","Positive"
"11449","I have barely gotten Alexa for just one day, and I already love her! I love her personality and she has so many uses. Tip: Try asking her to sing a song for you! She's the sweetest <3","Positive"
"11450","I got this for my birthday and i love it. The sound is so clear and crip. Its amazing i look forward to learning all yhe cool this i can do with it.","Positive"
"11451","Works as advertised! I've found I use it most for keeping a shopping list, asking for the weather/news update, and playing music. It definitely has a ways to go, in its ability to find answers, as some of the most basic questions it has trouble answering. Nevertheless, I bought an Echo Dot to use in my home as well, since it does come in handy more often than not.","Positive"
"11452","It hardly ever understands questions and you can forget about asking it a semi complex questions, half the time i get frustrated and just look them up on my phone. Its basically a glorified alarm clock. Would not buy again would not recommend. The way you talk to it is not natural, i dont want to say play ""on spotify"" after every song request. they need to add the ability to set new default sources for some things like music and weather.","Positive"
"11453","I bought this as a birthday gift for myself in August of 2016. I really enjoy the fact that I don't have to stare at a screen to find songs to play or reorder some of my favorite products on line. Sometimes I ask Alexa to spell a word, define a word or simply for the time.","Positive"
"11454","NOT as easy or practical to use as the videos show.  Enabling a skill and remembering the exact name of the skill is not practical.  I haven't found the command to list my enabled skills so it's back to the app.","Positive"
"11455","It has difficulty understanding certain commands especially when the word is in Spanish.  Converts it to gringo Spanish.  For example try to get it to play one of your stations in Pandora that has a Spanish name.  It's easier to just pair the Echo and use Pandora on your phone.","Positive"
"11456","Lots of worthless skills to wade through setting it up.  I was considering adding a few more of these or the ""Dot"".  I'll pass on buying more.","Negative"
"11457","But the alarm clock works and pairing to Bluetooth is easy.","Positive"
"11458","Love these - but for my use I think I would rather spend the money on multiple 'Dot's' rather than one big one. Every family member wants one in their room.","Positive"
"11459","Omg I love this thing I have arthritis in my hands and I love that this thing you can talk to such an awsome product it makes you a shopping list by talking to it and gives me my pandora I love this thing worth every penny","Positive"
"11460","I understand trying to create an Amazon only product. But I would love more Google integration. Important emails, the calendar (which isn't working), Google Music.","Positive"
"11461","Overall it seems like I paid 179$ for a bluetooth speaker. Hoping this kinda stuff is implemented in OTA OS updates though.","Positive"
"11462","Big thing though - my remote control. It doesn't work. Did for about a monthish. I've replaced the batteries on it and still nothing. It's 30$ to buy a replacement, but I shouldn't have to since there's been absolutely no damage to it at all.","Positive"
"11463","Recommended!","Positive"
"11464","Occasionally, Alexa misunderstands my request and provides information or a song that has nothing at all to do with my request, but most of the time Alexa works very well.","Positive"
"11465","My family and I love Alexa!!!","Positive"
"11466","I bought this as one of the daily special values on QVC for $149 and it was well worth the money! I often host game nights and other gatherings and generally have my TV set to a music choice channel. I wanted something more centrally located, as well as something that could play specific songs with a simple voice request, and the Echo achieves these things and many more! What a fantastic product!","Positive"
"11467","Love, Love, Love it!!!!","Positive"
"11468","Although I just received my Echo 2 days ago, I have to say so far... I am in LOVE!! Very quick response, sounds great and just overall amazing!","Positive"
"11469","You don't have to be a techie to love Alexa. She does it all. We have had so much fun with her and she is a useful tool. I can get the weather, my grocery list, my to do list and my schedule with my morning coffee, just by asking. Highly recommended.","Positive"
"11470","Okay :  AMAZING!  Wish I were getting commissions on this product because so far 7 friends and relatives have immediately purchased theirs after seeing mine!  Just installed some TP-LINK light bulbs in two lamps and outdoor post light... LOVE how Alexa turns them on and off on command!  Love setting timers, asking questions, converting figures, playing songs, playing NPR, defining words (NYT crossword help), telling me the time when I can't see a clock, or the weather when not near a window, or temperature (as I do not own a thermometer),and so much more.  Just a FANTASTIC PRODUCT!","Positive"
"11471","It's surprising that this small item has such clarity of sound.","Positive"
"11472","We are VERY pleased with our purchase!","Positive"
"11473","When bored, I ask Alexa to tell me a joke and she tells me a silly joke. Alexa learns more skills as time passes and I don't wish to list them all, but some skills are more useful than others. For example, Alexa will compliment you all day long if you ask her to. It might make you feel good about yourself coming from a computer, or not, but it's entertaining if your bored.","Positive"
"11474","Jury is still out. I like it, mostly for the music aspect. I don't know how much more we will use it besides that. But I'm going to try things out and see how it goes.","Positive"
"11475","Great thing. However, it is a pity that the default weather forecast is for USA and not Singapore. Registration is also only for USA and not Singapore.","Positive"
"11476","I bought this for my 29 year old son last year for Christmas.  He still loves it and uses it a lot.  I wasn't sure if the novelty would wear off, but it hasn't.  Definitly a gift that is still used, so I'm happy!","Positive"
"11477","This make everything so much easier. Whether it is playing music that you ask, check the weather or any other aspect. This is a great gift for the techies out there!","Positive"
"11478","We've owned Alexa for around 1 1/2 years now.  She is very much part of our family.  She is most useful for us as a to-do list.  Anytime we need any grocery item or essential, we just ask Alexa to add to out to-do list and it shows up on our iphone.  I do wish the timer was an LED screen as it would be much more useful as a kitchen timer.  Attached is a video we made with Alexa.  Beware it can be a little scary..well not really.","Positive"
"11479","Love my Echo!  I have this and a DOT, and obviously this one is alot louder and can hear better.  Not sure if I'd pay full price for one, but at $139 it seemed like a good deal.","Positive"
"11480","My son saved up his money to buy the Echo. Alexa can hear you very well and the speakers are excellent. It's easy to move around the house and use in different places.It's a very useful and fun purchase.","Positive"
"11481","Refurbished? I'd say it is brand new! Alexa is awesome for random information, quick info on movie characters or movie times, helpful for local restaurants, good for music (amazing sound quality), and much more! Just simply setting timers in the kitchen via voice is a small thing but has such a big impact. She turns on my TV and lights and everyone thinks we are 'futuristic'. She is way better than Siri. Always listening and is very quick and responsive with answers and information. If you have the money, get this product! It is fun to have around the house!","Positive"
"11482","I've had for about two days. Great for controlling WeMo and Nest.","Positive"
"11483","Hard to sync with Amazon music unlimited. Sound quality is a bit weak for the price point.","Negative"
"11484","Whether your just asking her to play music or reordering something for the house or just to turn on a light, I really like my new girlfriend helping me out here and there. Alexa is the closest thing to a girlfriend my wife of 30 years has ever approved. Besides, she likes Alexa too.<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008B>","Positive"
"11485","This product is a great start (as is the tap) but there is still ways to go.","Positive"
"11486","Love it!  Its nice getting the all around news and other info with a question.","Positive"
"11487","I want to start by saying that I love the Echo, and everything it does. I've had mine for nearly two years. It's almost like having your own personal assistant. That aside, I rated it 1 star because you can now get everything that the Echo does if you spend $50 for the Amazon Dot, and you save $130.","Positive"
"11488","My family and me are still getting used to working and talking to Alexa, but we love our echo. Only had it a month now, but works perfectly, good sounding speakers even for music. Love it! Oh, and lighting fast shipping with prime, we got it the same week we oerdered it.","Positive"
"11489","I LOVE my Alexa!  I even told her I love her and she said ""that's very sweet"".  The first night we got it my husband was reading aloud all the things she can do, he mentioned the shopping list feature.  I was in the kitchen making dinner and I said ""So if I say 'Alexa, add 10 lbs of candy to the shopping list' she'll do it?"" and immediately I heard Alexa say ""10 lbs of candy has been added to your shopping list"".  I've listened to Podcasts, music and the sound of a crackling fireplace to go with my electric fireplace.  I sent my son a video of what she does, he was amazed so I'm sending him one for Christmas.  Wonderful product!","Positive"
"11490","Best device ever","Positive"
"11491","Fun, easy to set up.  Not to loud, the only thing I was disappointed with was it has to be plugged into all the time.  Was under the impression it could be charged and early moved.","Negative"
"11492","This thing is unbelievable.  Easy set up,  sound is fantastic and the features are mind blowing.  I learn something new about Echo/Alexa every day.","Positive"
"11493","Best thing period but even better to help with my newborn by playing all the white noise needed","Positive"
"11494","Its been months since Alexa is home. She is handy-dandy :) An active family member, always chirpy. We love her. Thanks Amazon for creating Alexa!","Positive"
"11495","My fianc loves this gift! He loves that he can use it for his schedule, weather updates and the speaker for music is fantastic! Super cool gadget! He uses it every day!","Positive"
"11496","POS...dead on arrival. If this is amazons track record, then its not for me","Negative"
"11497","This is a brick.  I have tried to connect this device using an apple iPhone, desktop and a laptop.  Nothing works.  It says to get help use the error code, but there is no way to get to help no button, no link.  Great Software design(NOT).","Positive"
"11498","After help from CS I got Echo to work.  I'm learning about all it can do with adding ""Skills"".","Positive"
"11499","Love my echos ... i have 2 in the house controlling most lights, playing music, helping us cook, and the skills are endless. Next step is to sync it with my thermostat.","Positive"
"11500","Excellent music source!! I've been looking for a good music system for my living room for quite a while now .not that I couldn't find one but it had to be right for both me and the wife..me: floor to ceiling speakers with a sub..wife: something small that she can't see ..me: a speaker in ever corner...wife: 1...that she can't see ...i needed something that could play different media iPod, SD card, CD's Internet radio , USB port..I have a very good Phillips radio that could do most of those things and had pretty good sound..but the sound was just coming from one place ..so I hooked up some external speakers and a mini sub and I was happy.."" I was happy"" the wife? Not so much! And I was about to add a speaker selector and expand into the dining room'...(you can just imagine her reaction!) I've been looking at the echo for a while but I thought it was limited cause my main music source is my iPod and it has no imports.....when it went on sale for black Friday for $139.00 I figure what the heck I'll give it a try...I took down everything and gave it to my youngest son ( mistake!) And waited for my echo. When it came I set it up and have been in love every since...the fact that it can stream from multiple sources prime, Pandora, ect. And I solved my iPod problem via Bluetooth transmitter (Brightech-Brightplay - Amazon $16.89) & I can upload 250 of my personal music to prime ...you can add a lot more for a price' as for the sound I think its pretty impressive for such a small speaker and the fact that it has 360' sound no matter what room I'm in I get a good listing experience.. Some reviews say its not as good as a Bose , or other high end speaker and its not.... but you don't pay $140 and get high end you get damn good! I already have a fire stick so I have a good ideal what Alexa can do...but now that I have echo I WILL be adding light switches and outlets! I've ordered a ""Echo Dot"" for my patio aka ""man cave"" where I have my ""really good speakers""!and NO WIFE!","Positive"
"11501","Bought as a family gift for Christmas last year.  Everyone LOVES it.  Bought a Dot this year.","Positive"
"11502","Love it this device. Feels I am like in the jetsons. So cool to turn off your lights with your voice.","Positive"
"11503","We have had this for a couple months now and the sound as the speakers have broken in has only gotten better. I am still impressed at the quality of the sound for such a small device. I have a Denon AVR with a seven speaker set-up and I find myself asking Echo to play music instead because any music in the Prime library is just a question away from playing. I am listening to a Tom Petty mix as I write this and it no doubt uses less energy then firing up the 95w/channel Denon. The Denon has become mostly a movie device now. The timer function continues to be very useful use almost daily feature. The other day I had two timers running at the same time.","Positive"
"11504","We are in our early 70's and find our Amazon Echo fun.  She quickly answers our commands, and says so if she doesn't know the answer.  We find new things she can do almost daily.  We love it.","Positive"
"11505","Set up my Echo today. This thing is great. Check scores, the weather, play music, set a timer or alarm, get answers to questions. Just ask Alexa and she will try to answer. Fun. So far I am impressed. I guess if you have a smart phone,(they are too big for my taste), you may not think the Echo is useful because you could do the same thing with your smart phone I guess. But your smart phone is still not as cool. Oh yeah the sound for it's size is great also. I doubt your smart phone sounds this good.","Positive"
"11506","Pure junk! A scam at best. Good for grade school, but beyond that, its simply useless.","Positive"
"11507","Best item I have purchased from Amazon. Love Echo!","Positive"
"11508","Awesome, awesome, awesome","Positive"
"11509","She has a LOT more schooling to do... most of the simple things I ask she said, ""Sorry, I didn't understand the question"".","Negative"
"11510","Fantastic Sound .... Extremely Creative .... Streams Amazon Music .... Listen To Up To Date News ..... Current Weather & Forecasts","Positive"
"11511","Bought an Echo because I liked the Echo Dot. The tech is still a work in progress, but it's good enough to see the potential, and it's already worth having. There are times when you can ask it a seemingly simple question that it can't answer, or when it gets something wrong because it doesn't understand, but that's the type of thing that will get worked out over time as more people ask questions and Amazon has a larger pool of data to work with.","Positive"
"11512","4 stars instead of 5 because of the physical design of the Echo. It's top heavy, which isn't the end of the world, but it wobbles. The base is not flat and it allows the Echo to wobble, or rock, back and forth (using the label for orientation). I sent the first one back thinking it must be flaw, but it's just the design as the second was identical. If you never touch the thing, you'd never notice, but since you can both mute and adjust the volume manually, you'll probably run into this. This make the Echo feel less than solid. It's a small thing, but it makes it feel cheap.","Negative"
"11513","I am really enjoying my Echo product. I have a friend at work that keeps asking me why do I need it when I have my phone (Siri) that essentially does the same thing. I tell him it's so much more. Much more convenient (to me) and it keeps getting better. The only way to truly justify this type of technology is to ""just use it!"". Even if you ask it the most inane of questions, you are using it. Great product.","Positive"
"11514","Just got my Echo today and so far I absolutely love it. The sound could be better but I stilllive it!!!","Positive"
"11515","Gets better everyday!","Positive"
"11516","This review is likely a drop in the bucket, but we do love our Amazon Echo. We use it way more often than our high quality bluetooth speakers because of the convenience of waking up ""Alexa"" using nothing but our words. I find myself using the Echo mostly for music (it is connected to our Pandora, Spotify and Amazon Music accounts), but also to create shopping lists, get the weather, track traffic and even do basic arithmetic. We have recommended it to our friends and purchased an additional one as a gift.","Positive"
"11517","It's sort of fun.  But not really a necessity for me.  There are some nice features which you can read elsewhere, but my phone does most of the things Alexa does already.  It really is just a toy.","Positive"
"11518","Just as good as the new one for less money. This would be my second Echo and I have had no problems using both in two different location tied to the same prime account.","Negative"
"11519","This thing is a lot of fun plus a big help!","Positive"
"11520","I just received it on Saturday and I LOVE IT! Its everything they said it would be and more!","Positive"
"11521","Awesome sound!!","Positive"
"11522","We have this in black and bought his for a gift!  We LOVE Alexa!","Positive"
"11523","In a word....OUTSTANDING.  From soup to nuts, Alexa has the answers and/or solutions.  And the sound of the music will rival most upper end stereos.  Highly recommend!!","Positive"
"11524","Life changing, absolutely love it!!","Positive"
