I honestly after a year or so have found so many uses for this device that i went out and purchased two Dots to compliment it. I use Echo to turn on and off lights, set timers, add to my shopping list and for just daily life that when i go away on travel i find myself wishing i could just say "turn off the lights" and "set an alarm" in my hotel room.
