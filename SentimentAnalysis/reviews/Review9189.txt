1) It is unable to give you driving direction or traffic direction to more than one pre-set location. On the Alexa app, you present one location as your daily commute. You can ask it what is the traffic like or direction, etc. It will give you the traffic and fastest route just for that location. You can not ask Alexa can you give me direction to let say LAX or to the corner of X and Y in the City of Z. Would not work. Very very disappointing.
