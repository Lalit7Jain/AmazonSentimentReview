I enjoy having a smart voice-controlled device, but I have not found myself using the voice control for more than just asking Alexa to play a song on spotify. Occasionally, I will ask Alexa to tell me a joke, put something on my to-do list, tell me the weather, or set an alarm, but I often find my phone a more convenient utility for these features, so the utility for those features diminish.  The Echo becomes more useful once you acquire and integrate more smart home features like lights and locks, which is something I have not found the motivation to do--the value proposition is not there yet. The Echo also requires having it plugged in at all times, which can be very inconvenient when needing to move it to a new room, plugging in and waiting for it to connect to the internet again.
