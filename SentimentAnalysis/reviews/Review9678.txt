2) It is not integrated with the Amazon Fire TV.  This seems like a bit of a no-brainer to me as both devices are manufactured and sold by Amazon, and they are both sitting on the same local network.  Alexa should be able to tell the Fire TV to play some country music, for example, and have it play from the Amazon Prime music collection.  With a thousand watts of awesomeness in my home theater connected to the Fire TV, you think I really want to hear music from the Amazon Echo's little speaker?  Come on!  Voice command would be like, "Alexa, play some country music on the Fire TV" or "Alexa, tell the Fire TV to play some country music".  Personally, I think they should enable "Alexa tell the..." because then you can use that voice command structure with any smart device in your home...like "Alexa, tell the Harmony to turn up the volume" <--see areas for improvement #1
