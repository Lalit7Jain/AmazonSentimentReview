I returned this item once I did a side by side comparison to Google Home.  Google Home interprets your requests much better.  you can ask the same request worded three ways and it worked.  Echo need to have precise requests or can't help.  I also have an Echo Dot and find it far more versatile for 1/4 price.  Right now this is little better than an expensive bluetooth speaker.  I really want this to connect to my home stereo.  Yes, I know it has a speaker, but not as big sound or quality of a home audio system.  If you want an echo, buy the echo dot, maybe one for each bedroom as well.  We use our dot in place of a night radio, alarm clock, lists, reminders, weather.  Very versatile, but again Alexa, the underlying brain needs very specific formats/commands.  .
