Actually way better than I thought it might be, these assistant devices are the future.  I saw this on Mr Robot season 2 and it looked like a fun toy that I could try out for a while. Well, it's become essential now. In the month I've had it I: set up a smart home setup with smart lights, removed my radio alarm clock using this instead, demoed it to 5 other people who went on to buy echo dots themselves, listen to way more music and radio than I did before. I bought a refurb one because I've had good luck with refurbs and I couldn't tell the difference if this was a new echo or not, i've never actually seen a brand new echo in all fairness. If you keep your questions to it simple enough it knows a lot of stuff, "when was the french revolution?" that kind of thing. It really is a good start to personal assistants.
