I can’t believe it – I’m in love with Alexa. Head over heels love. Let’s be clear. It wasn’t love at first sight like when I met my husband and something inside said, “This one’s the one.” Oh no. Quite the opposite. When I unwrapped the gift my son gave me I thought, “Just what I need. Another thing that plays music, answers questions, and turns on the alarm system.” But my son was so excited, it was contagious. I thought, “Hey maybe this is the one.” She wasn’t.
