  If I'm playing YouTube videos, music from an app, or simply listening to an audio book, this thing is very glitchy, it freezes, it sputters, and overall sounds like pure, unadulterated S*!T  This company makes what...  like $120 billion a day??  Surely your signature product that you can't even keep on the shelves, deserves a little more attention than you've given it, no??
