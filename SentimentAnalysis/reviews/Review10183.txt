Alexa, I love you!!  She is wonderful!  She makes our shopping list, plays Christmas music, tells us the score of the Eagles game,  orders items off Amazon, tells us if we need our umbrella,  tells us the best route to our destination and even does the dishes!  OK we haven't taught Alexa that yet but we're getting there!!  We love her and put Dots all over the house in the bedrooms!!  Falling asleep with Alexa is wonderful, she even wakes us up in the morning!  We love you Alexa xxxooo
