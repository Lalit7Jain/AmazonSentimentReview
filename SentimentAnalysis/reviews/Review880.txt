Alexa was amusing for a while.  However, we never found it to be all that useful. For one thing, the voice recognition has clearly been trained by the 12-year olds who work in tech; it recognizes my teen son's commands very well, but has never understand me or my husband.  We tried many of the functions, like the shopping list. Often the voice recognition was poor and resulted in somewhat entertaining items on the grocery list, but not a useful shopping list.  We have had Alexa for 1 year, 9 months, and it is now completely dead, and out of the warranty period. We will not buy another one.
