Alexa has become a personal music assistant - once we connected her to our Spotify account, she can find almost any song in the world that we ask for. The Echo can understand my young kids, too, much to their delight. I look forward to finding out all that Echo can do, and plan to hook it into our thermostat as well. A fun device!
