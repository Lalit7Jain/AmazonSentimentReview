This is a really fun and cool tech thing to have especially if you know how to use it and if you still don't know how to use it, Amazon has representatives who specialize in the Amazon Echo and can help answer any of your questions. The sound quality is great and Alexa is pretty responsive to your call. I highly recommend this item to anyone who loves music and loves having something like Alexa at your beck and call. It's worth every penny.
