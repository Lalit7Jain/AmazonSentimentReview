The Amazon Echo has come a long way. I was one of the first people to order this and had to wait a few months for it to arrive. At first, I'm not sure anyone knew what to do with it. I suffer from a speaking disorder, as a result of being hit head-on by a distracted driver while riding my motorcycle. August 19, 2014. I tell you this because at first I wasn't understood by my own Echo.  I still am taking speech therapy for my disorder, however now I can speak to Alexa and she typically understands me well.  It has taken 1 year to accomplish this. Now I control my echos (yes, I have  one on each floor of my house, one hooked up to my stereo to broadcast through my home, and if I'm in a different room, I use the remote control to speak with her. Today, I look at the functionality and it is incredible. I just learned how to get Echo to be a MARS fact finder, and listen to Digital stations. I already learned how to use my Pandora radio. I haven't got Alexa to turn on/off lights, but soon. Amazon programmers have made Alexa incredible. Everyone should have Echo in their home !!!
