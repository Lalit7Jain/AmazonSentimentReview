So far it's good but it's one of those products were in time it could be great the only problem I don't like is when the music playing at vol 10 and u ask Alexa to volume down u have to yell in order to get the volume down but other then that it alright.the 360 sound while playing music is loud ...so far me and my family like it ..now I need to buy item that Alexa can control so I would have to give a update with the 3rd party asscories to put Alexa to its full potential ..as far as it  look it look awesome and the top led is nice so I give it 3 stars for now and see what updates can make it 5 stars..peace ESE TECH OUT
