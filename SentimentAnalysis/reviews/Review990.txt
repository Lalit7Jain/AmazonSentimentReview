I received Alexa for Christmas, 2016.  I have been using is for 3 months now.  Alexa is helpful with precise questions an/or demands. Amazon did say that she would "learn" your area by questions and commands you do. To this date she has not been too good at building on her knowledge of the area I live.  She will tell you the weather, temp, rain forecast, play radio stations you request, and look up phone numbers for local businesses if you ask her precisely the name.  She will not look up random businesses ie Alexa, look up pet stores in my area".  She will tell you she does not understand the question. I like the apps you can download to play soothing sleep sounds and more. She will do a lot more but basically what you have seen advertised is it.  I do plan on getting the adapter for the lights etc. For the price I would definitely recommend purchasing.
