I wasn't sure I would even have a use for this when I got it, but now I absolutely love it. It took me a couple weeks to realize I could ask Alexa for things instead of having to pick up my phone and search, but now it's just easy. In the kitchen and need a measurement conversion? Check. Need a timer? Check. I've had two or three going at once and it's awesome, especially when you're wrist deep in a chicken. LOL.
