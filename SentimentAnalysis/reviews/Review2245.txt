Really fun to use, Alexa is great at understanding what you're saying. Missing some key features though: Wish there was an alarm that could wake you up to music along with controlling a Philips dimmer light so your get both a music and a gradual light alarm. It makes no sense to me why you can't do that currently. Seems like such an easy and natural extension of the Echo's features.
