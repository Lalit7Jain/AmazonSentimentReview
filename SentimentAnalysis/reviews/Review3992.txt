This is not a review of Google vs Amazon.  Both have some issues.  But I would have expected Amazon to be further along than this.  This issues above lend to trying other vendors down the road.  Odds I will have sent up my second home with Google since there is no clean way to configure two locations and limit to only local devices  So my Subject of Novelty vs Necessity?  I’m heavily on the novelty side now.
