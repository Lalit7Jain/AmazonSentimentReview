The remote is Bluetooth. I had my Kindle Fire HDX and my smart phone  controlling the Echo with the Amazon Echo App, but something changed when the app became Alexa instead of Echo. The remote stopped working and I just let it sit for months. The I wanted to use it again and it was battery crust time in the remote. Even a good scraping and cleaning and new batteries didn't work. The solution is only one mobile device can be used to control the Echo. I'm not sure why but I know my remote works again I uninstalled the app front my Kindle Fire HDX and now the remote is happy.
