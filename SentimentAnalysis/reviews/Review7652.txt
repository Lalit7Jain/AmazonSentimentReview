Does what it says, but buyer beware: You'll need to also subscribe to Amazon Prime Music for access to "over 2 million songs." Spirit & iHeart radio do some diligence, but you can't just call out whatever song comes to mind with those. And Alexa is spotty in what she can answer or do unless your appliances are "smart" appliances. Like it's said, "You get what you pay for." You will pay for a lot more than Alexa if you want all of her abilities.
