The novelty of the Amazon Echo was interesting to say the least.  A bit disappointed that I spent $179 for it one week and found it for $139 two weeks later.  The features of the unit does make some elements of one's life easier.  Answers basic questions and I love the idea that my GOOGLE CALENDAR information once entered onto my computer is also memorized by ALEXA. Much of my music that had been saved on my computer can now be accessed by the Echo unit as well.  It has many potential uses as well, but for now, I use it for my music and calendar of events.
