I get up in the morning and the first thing I ask is for traffic updates, this gives me and idea of what time I need to leave the house. I get home at night and my wife has music playing while shes cooking dinner making her much more relaxed. It has been worth the money I paid  x10. As in the photo my wife wanted the echo off the counter so I bought the bluo echo wall mount for it and its been perfect.
