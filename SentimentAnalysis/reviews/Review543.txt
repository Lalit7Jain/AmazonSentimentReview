Haven't had a chance to use it. I actually bought it as a gift to be used as a Christmas gift. The recipient wasn't comfortable using it for fear of security issues. I was not able to return it despite the fact that it was still in the original, sealed packing because I had ordered it in the Fall a few months before Christmas when the price was lower.
