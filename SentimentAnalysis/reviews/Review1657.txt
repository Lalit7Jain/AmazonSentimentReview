5.  Alexa stopped letting me snooze. When I got Alexa, she let me sit up and say "Alexa snooze for four minutes." And she should snooze for four minutes. Now she only lets me "snooze" adn chooses the length of time she wants to snooze for, which seems to be ten or eleven minutes. That's not cool because it's just enough time for me to fall back asleep while I'm actually supposed to be figuring out what to wear today or something.
