Don't they think that each person having their own calendar and to-do list is kinda... common sense? If this gets fixed, I'll rate the Echo much higher but for now, I'm left sorting out how to get the most out of the Echo without inconveniencing my parents by loading up the calendar and to-do list. Hey, if I just wanted to listen to music, that's one thing... but as a personal assistant, well, I count this as a pretty major blunder. I might as well keep using other apps to fulfill these roles. Unfortunately, my main purpose in wanting an Echo was to use it as a personal assistant.
