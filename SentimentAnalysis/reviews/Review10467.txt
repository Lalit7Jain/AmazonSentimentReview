I just got this toy. I love it. There is still much I haven't used it for yet, but the concept is awesome. Alexa understands very well, and does learn as she goes. I just need to get all the items for her to interface with my house. If you just want a good speaker, she is good for that as well. I was thinking about this or Google Home. The Google item just doesn't look neat. Kind of drab actually. I love the way technology is heading, and this is a neat toy to have if you are a tech fan like me.
