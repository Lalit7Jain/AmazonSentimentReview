Bought for the wife as a present. Saw it in action at a friends house so she wanted one. Great item i never thought we would need or want. Plays music and some cool games we haven't checked out just yet. Great for asking questions and getting answers. Wife is French so she has trouble with ounces and gallons. Easily helps her with recipes getting the quantities converted into metric. I have it set up to control our hue lights as well as linking it to our spotify account. Great at making lists for shopping. Downloaded the todoist app and have that linked so the list shows up on my phone. Learning more and using it more everyday. It actually does a lot more than I thought it would.
