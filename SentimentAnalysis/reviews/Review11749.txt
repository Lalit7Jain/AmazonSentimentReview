Ordered this in January 2015. Received it in May 2015. It stopped working in October 2016. It is caught in an infinite startup loop (solid blue with spinning cyan lights). Factory reset via the hole on bottom did nothing. Customer service was friendly, but couldn't help. They said I needed to purchase a new one and offered a few dollars off. That's ridiculous. A $200 device that doesn't last 1.5 years, just long enough to screw customers over with a short warranty. I expected more from Amazon. Will not be replacing. Will wait for Apple's device that is coming soon.
