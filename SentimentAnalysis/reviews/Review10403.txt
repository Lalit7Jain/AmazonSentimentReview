The Echo is growing on me more and more as we slowly add more skills to it.  We love the bedtime stories and the ability to listen to so much music and talk radio.  My main beef is that music when played from Amazon does not have the same volume level.  Sometimes it gets louder sometimes quieter.  Have to constantly adjust volume.  Do like the voice control, but if you don't speak clearly and succinctly it doesn't always do a good job of hearing and understanding.  You also need to speak quickly, if you hesitate in a request too much it will time out before you get your request spoken.
