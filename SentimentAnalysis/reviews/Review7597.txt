Love my Amazon Echo (and Echo Dot)!  Though we did not purchase them through Amazon I wanted to leave a review here.  So far we have all had lots of fun playing with the Echo.  The Meow, Meow app is hilarious and the cats are enjoying it, the news briefings are great and we are all taking turns requesting our favorite music.  No disappointments yet when I have asked a question or opened an app (or skill, habits are hard to break).  Even with my southern accent Alexa seems to be able to understand and respond to everything I say.  Alexa is also able to hear me from the living room though the Echo is placed in the kitchen so I really appreciate not having to be right on top of the device to use it.  I placed an Echo in my bedroom for use as an alarm clock and for music and I really like being able to ask Alexa to "play ocean sounds" or "play sleep music."  I see the whole family using these devices daily.  The shopping list is terrific too!
