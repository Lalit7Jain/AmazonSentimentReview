The voice is surprisingly good for a talking assistant. It's like having an extra set of hands for doing basic tasks like turning on lights while you unlock the door and looking up conversions while you cook. It is a decent Bluetooth speaker on its own for playing Pandora and its a good conversation starter and entertainment piece.
