Randomly stopped working. Our Echo has worked well for the last year or so. We honestly don't use it for much, but it at least worked. Within the last month, it has stopped working consistently. It is having more trouble understanding us and says it is losing its connection to the internet. I have attempted to restore it, but that has not helped. Completely unreliable. I'm kind of fed up with Amazon's devices, they're great at first, but they get so buggy and become unreliable. I would not recommend it.
