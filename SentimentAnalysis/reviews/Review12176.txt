It for $99.00. Can't beat that. My kids love asking it questions and we enjoy listening to music on it. I most recently got into home automation and the echo is compatible with a lot of the products on the market so it is definitely a win win in my household. Purchase this now and you won't regret it. Google, Apple, Samsung, etc are trying to catch up to Amazons echo but they have nothing on the market to compare.
