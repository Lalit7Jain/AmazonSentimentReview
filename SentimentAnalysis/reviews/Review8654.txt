My only complaints would be 1):  as she ages, she's getting heard of hearing; and 2): wish we could customize the wake-up command and her voice.  Surprisingly, my 19-year-old son loves it as much as I do.  I even ordered him the Echo Dot for Christmas!  I have had no issues with the refurbished unit and it works like new!  I would definitely recommend the Echo!
