Basically it's just a fancy bluetooth speaker, for which it is WAY overpriced. The other Alexa features are, quite frankly, underwhelming. Once the novelty of using them wore off after the first weekend, it's become nothing more than a voice activated music player. Which it does quite well. Just don't expect it to do much else very well.
