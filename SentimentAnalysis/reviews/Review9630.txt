I'm in love already, and I've only had this thing for less than an hour.  I tested having it play my Audible books, and it does an amazing job.  It's going to be so nice at bedtime to be able to tell it to pause, or set the sleep timer without having to fiddle with my phone, which I usually knock off the end table trying to grab.
