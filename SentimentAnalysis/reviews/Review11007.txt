Interesting concept, but is disappointing for me. Using a Win7 64bit Pro system, have drivers problems. Setup would not complete train. Spent too many hours trying to program with little success. Finally had some TV action. Lost house power long enough that the Echo started over without TV. Echo keeps dropping internet. Win7 drivers are needed, but not easy to find. I do not have an Android. Had to restore PC. Few instructions are received with Echo. Assume I should have purchased an instruction manual for dummies. Very frustrated after second wasted day. Too bad I do not have a 12 yr old around.
