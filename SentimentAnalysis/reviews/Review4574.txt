Well it was working fine until today!  Now it skips during playing music, like it's buffering, and it keeps losing its connection.  I tried rebooting it, setting up again and turning off my modem and rebooting that...hopefully it's just a little glitch but if not, what a waste of money.  Not a good day for Alexa today <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0095>
