Called customer support. A nice kid tried to help me for 45 minutes but it basically consisted of him telling me it was strange that it wasn't working, and having him tell me to try the same commands in ten different ways. I flat out told him even if we got it to work (which we never did), I would never remember all these ridiculous hoops. Say scene before the scene name not after. Say "for" bedroom not "in" bedroom. Say it this way and that. Oy.
