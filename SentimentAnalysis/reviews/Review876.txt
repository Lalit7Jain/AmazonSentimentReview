Alexa can so rarely recognize me calling her name that I frequently find myself yelling at her, especially when music is playing. And if she does hear me while nothing is playing, there's no auditory feedback, so I can't tell if I should continue with my voice command unless I'm looking directly at the echo. Usually when I get past the wake word, the voice recognition works more than half the time. But if Alexa can't understand what you said while music is playing, instead of waiting to hear a response from you, she rudely turns the music back up, and you have to repeat the wake word another 6 times to try to get a command in edgewise. Irritatingly, she will wake up at random and answer a gibberish question no one asked, apparently because she overheard something in the room. It's just not a great user experience.
