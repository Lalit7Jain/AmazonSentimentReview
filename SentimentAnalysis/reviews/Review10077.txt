Where she really shines is her integration with Spotify, Pandora and TuneIn. After linking these services, all you have to do is ask for a song or playlist from your service and she gets it for you. Her accuracy with spotify so far for me is about 80%. Sometimes she will say that she can't find a certain song, but if you get more specific with your request, she will find it. Where she starts to have trouble is with little kid voices. My kids (7,3) love using it, but she has a hard time understanding them sometimes. Once they slow down and speak clearly, it works just fine.
