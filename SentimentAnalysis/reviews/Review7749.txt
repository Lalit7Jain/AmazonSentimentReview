Alexa can be very funny. Ask a funny question she will answer. Good buy. She will even tell you a joke when asked to.There was a Echo next to me and while face timing my family who also received  an Echo heard my family ask their Echo a question and the one by me would answer the question. Hope that made sense. It gave us lots of laughter.
