Absolutely love Alexa! I don't have many songs on my phone (being of the older generation :) so I agreed to the free 1 month AMazon music membership. I will definitely continue the membership for $3.99 a month  moving forward. Had some friends over for dinner recently and they were so impressed tha they are going to get one. Alexa is so sensitive to her name that she lights up if you are just having a conversation. Be careful though if you have someone named Alexa in your house!
