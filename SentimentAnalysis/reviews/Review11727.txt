I don't understand when people say she can't hear them. She has no problem hearing 6 to 10 feet away. It would be to your advantage to get on your Kindle and download the free manual available and get to know Alexa before you give her a bad review. If you have trouble connecting her to your WiFi make sure you have Internet connection sometimes it can glitch out. I called Amazon customer service and requested an Echo Tech. to talk to. When you first get her and download the app on a mobile device, the app might be lacking, just plug Alexa in let her power up, you can connect WiFi with the app, once that happens, mute Alexa by touching speaker button, her ring will glow red, leave her alone for about 30 minutes. Check her app on your mobile device for content, if the app has upgraded so has she. Alexa will then do everything Amazon says she does. Have fun with her and talk to her often. The more you interact with her the more awesome the experience you'll have.
