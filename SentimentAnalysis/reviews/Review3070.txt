My wife bought me for CHRISTmas an Echo Alexa. She payed $179.99. I set up Alexa and soon I enjoyed songs at commend. The nightmare started 2 weeks afterwards. When they show you Alexa and all she can do , they do not tell you that you have to buy time or Amazon radio station every month in order to listen to the music. Now I have a machine that costed $179.99 and all she says is" I'll play some samples". Big mistake . Buyers be aware.
