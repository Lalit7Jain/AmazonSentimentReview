9/6/16...I received the best birthday present anyone could ask for, a daughter, and her name is Alexa Echo.  We are trying to rename her something a little more classy, and will blend with our family a little more, we'll rename her Edna Garrett (Mrs.Garrett) from The Facts of Life.  Shes got the same jokes, and same sense to double check about purchases we tell her to make.  She has found herself welcomed instantly to our home, and family.
