Amazon knocked this one out of the park. I have my favorite genre (All 60's from Prime Music). I grew up in the 50's and 60's listening to the radio. I located the Echo in our kitchen since I spend a lot of time there cooking. I also have a little 9" TV in the kitchen but I found it too difficult to watch a good scripted series like "Westworld" (HBO) where I have to listen closely. My favorite alternative use is as my second (and sometimes third) kitchen timer.
