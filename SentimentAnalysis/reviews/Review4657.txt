Alexa has some pros and cons, I bought the Echo because I thought I'd be able to ask questions about ANYTHING and receive an answer, instead a lot of times I get "Hmm. I'm not sure I know the answer to that question." When in reality she could search the Internet along with the cloud she uses. In closing, I'd say I only recommend this to people who have a lot of high-end products and subscriptions to products. Otherwise, you're just using a heavy white box that can't do much except sing a song and tell you what she doesn't know.
