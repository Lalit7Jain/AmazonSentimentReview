This is so cool! I cannot say enough good things about it. Only con is my 6 year old was caught using it to give her homework answers. Otherwise it's going to be similar to the TV, I think every home will soon have one. I haven't burnt cookies because of the timer, my food budget is on point because the shopping list keeps me from duplicating items. I LOVE IT!!!!
