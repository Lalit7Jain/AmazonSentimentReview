Love our Echo but after 2 years it's a $200 paperweight. It was working fine until it was unplugged and moved. When we plugged it back in... nothing. After all sorts of troubleshooting nothing. Apparently the "unplugging Echo wrecks the Echo" problem is more common than you realize. We will get a new one(customer service giving us a whopping $15 off for our troubles), it just bothers me it has a 2 year working life. They do replace them if the issue occurs in the first few months. If yours works, do not unplug it lest you suffer the consequences.
