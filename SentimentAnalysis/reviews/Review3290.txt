My Echo lasted 1 year and 20 days. Just over the warranty. I love the idea and it worked well. I was just about ready to purchase devices controlled by Echo. Good thing I didn't . I called Amazon and got advice that was not helpful.  At that price it should have lasted longer. I like the idea but I am not going to pay another $ 180..00 for another year..I will buy the google version for less money !!
