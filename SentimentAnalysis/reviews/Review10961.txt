I don't know even where to begin with this little gem. This has made life so much more enjoyable and very very handy in the kitchen. Just the timer feature alone is great. The voice recognition is amazing...and the multi mics to register all over the room...priceless. Tapping into my music collection and access to my personal calendar as well as driving status for my morning commutes, this is a great piece of tech that keeps getting better all the time. I sugest getting to to how to use the IFTTT app out there. It offers so many different things you can use with the Echo. I am very happy and am considering another one, maybe the Dot if I can justify it. If I could unplug this and run it room to room it would be perfect but we will leave that for another debate. Right now my whole family loves this little cylinder and that makes me very happy...even if the Mrs. only play country music with it:)
