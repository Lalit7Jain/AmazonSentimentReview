MARCH 7 - APPX  9PM PST:  Echo an Alexa go down with no warning.  It is impossible to contact Amazon via phone, message or email.  After waiting 15 minutes on the phone, they hang up on customers with a recorded message saying "No one is available to take your call."  Anyone with alarms, timers, etc. set on Alexa during this down time are screwed.  Turn on the lights...nope. Stop the music...no way.  Beware of relinquishing control of your home to this device...it is hugely unreliable and Amazon is not there to back it up.  Worst customer service ever.
