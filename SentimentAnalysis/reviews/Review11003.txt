Just received my 2nd Echo. I have had the 1st for over a year. I'm an audio geek and really did not buy the Echo for music. But the sound is exceptional for its size and now my wife and I use them in different rooms and the Echos are the only way we listen to music out loud. And speaking of loud, the Echo can fill up a good size great room with more than pleasant sound. Now with Amazon Music you can just start up a music station based on artist, song etc..., as well as request on demand music from millions of songs, all with your voice. We did have to adjust the wake word for the new one to Echo, the rooms are somewhat close, but I think it is just a testament to the quality of the built in microphones used by Amazon. Right out of the box it took just a quick setup with the Alexa App to connect the new Echo to my WiFi and now it too controls our lighting and such, adds things to our shopping lists, answers our questions, and plays beautiful music, just as well as the original. No learning needed...just saying. The Echo is by far the best deal in all of technological gadgetom. Love it, love it, love it times two!
