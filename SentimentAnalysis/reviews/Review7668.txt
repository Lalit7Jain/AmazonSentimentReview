I have no idea how this performs or sounds.  After 6 hours with router setting changes, reboots and talks with customer service I have officially given up trying to get this to connect to my wifi.  The latest comment from Amazon was that the 2.4 and 5 GHz signals needed to be separated within my router.  Apparently they are the same name so the Echo is confused as to which to connect to and so it doesn't connect.  I could call my internet service provider and ask them to separate them.  I tried and of course they were no help whatsoever.  It can't possibly be worth all this trouble.  Back in the box it goes for a return.  When they actually make this easy to connect to wifi - maybe i will think about buying it.
