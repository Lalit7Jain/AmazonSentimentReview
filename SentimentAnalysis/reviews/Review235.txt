Positives: It's sleek looking and innovative piece of technology. I really tried to like it but 1) robotic voice makes it annoying to listen for long replies 2) no Roku & SmartThings Security (only lights) integration 3) sound quality not great for music either, at least not in same level as my (cheaper) sound bar sounds. So, at the end, I had practically zero use cases left for the device.
