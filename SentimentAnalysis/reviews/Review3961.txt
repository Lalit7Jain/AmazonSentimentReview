We have had our echo since Christmas and our family has thoroughly enjoyed her.  Ya, she might not always be the smartest, but she is fun none the less.  You do have to word things just right sometimes, but she has a sense of humor and I can totally see a single person finding her company nice also.  Google hidden skills and randomly ask her questions to see if she might have a funny response.  Our favorite present of the season and the entire family likes her.
