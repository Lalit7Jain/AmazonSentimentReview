It worked for one day and then it didn't work at all. It's a WiFi issue, with a very complicated fix.  A fix that I just don't have time to muddle through.  It's just supposed to work.  They want me to split my WiFi blah blah blah, come on Amazon, do better.  If it worked fine one day there is no reason it shouldn't have worked after that, so now it just sits on my desk.  I wanted to like it, and I did, or one day.
