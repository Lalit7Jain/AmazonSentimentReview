I love my Echo.  I have it connected in the kitchen for music while cooking and just hanging out having a few drinks.  Timer feature is handy for cooking.  Great to have weather and encyclopedic knowledge so easily available.  I just wish it was a little smarter and had more personality, even though the personality seems to be developing more.  I bought a second one for the bedroom.
