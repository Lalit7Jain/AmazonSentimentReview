I got a dot first. Got the Echo, because sometimes the dot is not loud/good enough to listen to music. But really, the improvement is incremental, and when the Echo is at a volume that the Dot cannot achieve, it stops being able to do voice recognition. Thinking I might have better (and more cheaply) gotten two extra dots - one for the kitchen. You can never have enough dots. And adding a remote speaker to the dot allows louder volume while still being able to do voice control.
