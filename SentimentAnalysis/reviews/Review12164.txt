So far the best part of the Echo is controlling smart things in my home like my HUE lights and my new NEST thermostat. The issue I have is that since it's always connected to the Internet why can it not answer simple questions. Most of the time if I ask Alexa what I think is a simple questions she tell's me she cannot find the answer, so I whip out my phone and ask Google and 99.9% of the time Google can answer the same question. I hope they improve that performance. For controlling the HUE lights they should enable you to change colors with the voice command, I am not sure this is an Echo thing or a HUE limitation. If I ask Alexa what is the current temperature in my house (using the nest) she gives me the weather outside. My kids enjoy asking her questions or to to tell them a Joke. I think over time I would use it much more with better Skills.
