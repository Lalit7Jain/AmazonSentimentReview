I find the most useful feature of alexa is to play music.  There is a discounted amazon music plan that allows you to access a huge music library (only on alexa).  I wish the base were more rich.  Other than that, she can do a lot of 'tricks'.  can't wait for the technology to advance further! I'm really happy with this thing.
