I ask her for a "News Brief," and she politely gives me a "Flash Briefing" of news from NPR, BBC News, and the Washington Post. When I sit down to work on my laptop, I can ask her to "Play some classical music" and "set the volume to three." When my phone rings, I simply say, "Alexa, stop," so I can talk on the phone, then, "Alexa resume," and she picks up where she left off on the last musical selection.
