I hadn't initially given much thought to one of these, until I saw one at a friend's house, and heard how good the sound was, and thought it might be nice to have for playing music.  Then, I really started looking into all it could do, and thought I might really enjoy it.  I decided, though, to try out a Dot first, to see if I'd really get into the functionality, and I did!  So, now I have my Amazon Echo for the living room.  Using Pandora and my Amazon playlists more than ever, and am also enjoying using it for my Audible books.  A little thing that's coming in handy is being able set a hands-free timer from my kitchen.  Still so much to explore with it, and I'm looking forward to it.  Do have to watch out that it sometimes picks up on the Echo commercials on TV (which was funny at first, but could get annoying -- and I don't want to change my wake word unless I have to), but otherwise, is usually responsive and accurate (with some minor misunderstandings sometimes, but we're still getting to know each other :-) ).
