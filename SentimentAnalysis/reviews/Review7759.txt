ALEXA IS THE HIGHLIGHT TO EVERYONES EVENING!! I have bought two of these already.  This device is so smart and useful. It has a loud speaker which is great for entertaining my guests and connects to services such as Pandora and iHeart Radio.  Also shes remembers my calendar and shopping list.  I feel like Alexa has become smarter over the year I've had her and her personality seems to grow.  I would love to test how some of the other smart products such as light bulbs and thermostats interact with her.
