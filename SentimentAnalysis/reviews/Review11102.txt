Echo is just a disaster and a frustrating exercise when it comes to controlling home devices. It suddenly couldn't find my devices anymore and then after more than an hour of troubleshooting and following a mile-long email of tech support instructions from Amazon, I just gave up. And, no, Amazon, I don't want to invest more of my time by taking up your invitation for phone support, unless of course you're willing to pay me for my time. All this is not worth it for 2 crummy light bulbs. And I don't think much of the rest of Alexa's skill set either
