Just love this thing. Alexa will replace your so... many things. Speaker, Apps, Home Automation, Programming Toy, AWS services toolkit and much more. My kid, the 15-month baby, loves when Alexa talks out loud and plays songs. He is more fascinated recently when Alexa is doing the lights on/off thing for us in the living room. In fact, it was little darker yesterday, and he started to talk to Alexa, maybe he wanted the lights on? I'm super happy with the purchase, and I intend to buy echo dots during the Thanksgiving season. Cheers!
