PPT will walk through the entire process of the case study and the approach

Part 1) Scraping amazon product review and identifying Positive/Negative classes using Lexicon approach (this is in R)

Part 2a) Working on the scrapped reviews and creating Doc2Vev vectors using gensim package and both models (DM and DBOW) (This is in Python 3)
